{"book_name":"Boundaries_ When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life by Henry Cloud and John Townsend.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":162,"chapter_title":"LEARNING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY","summary":"In this chapter, the authors explore the significance of boundaries in teaching children responsibility. They describe how parents gradually transfer their qualities of motivation, planning, and skills to their children. By implementing boundaries, children learn to internalize these attributes and become self-sufficient.

Ultimately, boundaries empower children to grow into responsible, loving individuals.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A nurturing parent-child interaction symbolizing responsibility transfer, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, warm beige, soft brown, rich green, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"classical and nurturing","overlay_opacity":15,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F"],"font_primary":"Panchang-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-SemiBold.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Boundaries Shape Responsibility","section_body":"Boundaries play a crucial role in how children learn to receive and manage resources.
