{"book_name":"Boundaries_ When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life by Henry Cloud and John Townsend.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":37,"chapter_title":"SEPARATION AND INDIVIDUATION: THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SOUL","summary":"This chapter explores the fundamental importance of attachment in human development as the foundation for boundaries. It discusses the delicate balance between attachment and autonomy, particularly in early childhood. When parents provide a secure emotional environment, children develop a sense of safety, which is essential for setting boundaries later in life. The chapter emphasizes the process of separation and individuation, where children learn to distinguish themselves from their primary caregivers. The ultimate goal is to achieve emotional object constancy, which fosters inner security and a healthy sense of self.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A nurturing mother and a curious child, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, soothing beige, muted sage green, soft browns, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"gentle yet profound","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#C47A4D"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Light.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Attachment: The Foundation of the Soul","section_body":"At the core of our existence is the need for relationship.
