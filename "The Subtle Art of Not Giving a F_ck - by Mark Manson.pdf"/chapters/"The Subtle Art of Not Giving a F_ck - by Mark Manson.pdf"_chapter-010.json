{"book_name":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F_ck - by Mark Manson.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":10,"chapter_title":"CHOOSE YOUR STRUGGLE","summary":"In this chapter, Mark Manson challenges the typical pursuit of happiness by emphasizing the necessity of struggle in life. He illustrates that our emotional responses can lead us to poor decision-making and that true fulfillment comes from accepting the inherent difficulties within any desire. Instead of asking what we want to enjoy, we should contemplate what pain we are willing to endure. Manson argues that life’s meaning is derived from our struggles and the choices we make in facing them. Recognizing this can profoundly shift our perspective towards personal growth and satisfaction.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A person standing at the foot of a mountain, contemplating the climb ahead, Bright sunlight casting strong shadows, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, #1D1D1D, Reflective, Minimalist, Digital Art, Close-up perspective --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"motivational","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#1D1D1D"],"font_primary":"Panchang-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Regular.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Limits of Emotional Decision-Making","section_body":"Overidentifying with emotions often leads to poor choices.
