{"book_name":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F_ck - by Mark Manson.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":35,"chapter_title":"THE FAILURE/SUCCESS PARADOX","summary":"In this chapter, Mark Manson delves into the paradox of failure and success, emphasizing that real value comes from autonomy and the willingness to embrace failure. He shares personal experiences that highlight how traditional metrics of success, like money, can obscure true fulfillment. Using Picasso's story, Manson underscores that mastery and improvement stem from repeated failures rather than avoiding them. The fear of failure often arises from adopting external values that dictate our self-worth, which can stifle our growth. Instead, Manson advocates for process-oriented values that promote ongoing engagement and personal fulfillment.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A contemplative artist in a café, sketching on a napkin, a rich ambiance of creativity, warm lighting, soft oranges, earthy browns, and muted greens, reflective and inspired, watercolor, digital art, close-up composition --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"Artistic reflection and creativity","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#EDE4D9","#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Defining True Value","section_body":"Growing up in a wealthy environment taught me that money often masks problems rather than solving them.
