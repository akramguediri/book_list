He emphasizes that suffering and pain are inevitable parts of the human experience, serving essential biological roles in our evolution. Manson argues against the myth that happiness is an achievable state devoid of problems. Instead, he presents a perspective that encourages accepting life's challenges as a path to growth and understanding. Ultimately, he urges readers to seek out 'good problems' as the way forward rather than longing for a problem-free existence.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Disappointment Panda, whimsical environment, soft lighting, #B8C3A8, #D2BBA0, #1D1D1D, profound, illustration, digital art, close-up --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"playful yet thought-provoking","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#B8C3A8","#D2BBA0","#1D1D1D"],"font_primary":"BluuNext-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Life is Filled with Suffering.","section_body":"Suffering is a universal experience that we all must face.
