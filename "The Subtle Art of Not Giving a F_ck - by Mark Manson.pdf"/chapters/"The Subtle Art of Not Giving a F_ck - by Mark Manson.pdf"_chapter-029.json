{"book_name":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F_ck - by Mark Manson.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":29,"chapter_title":"BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU BELIEVE","summary":"Our beliefs are often constructed from inaccurate neural connections and biases that shape our perceptions. The mind tends to cling to what it already knows, resisting new evidence that contradicts firmly held beliefs. This chapter explores the troubling phenomenon of false memories through the story of Meredith Maran, who mistakenly accused her father of abuse based on skewed memories crafted by her emotional experiences and therapeutic pressures. It highlights how our memories can be easily manipulated and distorted, leading us to believe in narratives that may not be true. Understanding the limitations of our memory is crucial to navigating our beliefs and relationships effectively.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A complex human brain illuminated by neural connections, a therapy session room, warm ambient light, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, #BA8B6A, reflective mood, realistic, digital illustration, close-up view --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"Reflecting on psychological insights and memory","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#BA8B6A"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Regular.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Beliefs Are Often Biased","section_body":"The brain is prone to mistakes, leading us to create false meanings based on our limited experiences.
