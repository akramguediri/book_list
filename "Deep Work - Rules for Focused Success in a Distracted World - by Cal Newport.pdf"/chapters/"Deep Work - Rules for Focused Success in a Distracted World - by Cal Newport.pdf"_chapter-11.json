{"book_name":"Deep Work - Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World - by Cal Newport.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":11,"chapter_title":"QUIT SOCIAL MEDIA","summary":"In this chapter, Cal Newport emphasizes the importance of quitting or minimizing social media use to reclaim focus and enhance productivity. He uses the experiment of Baratunde Thurston, who disconnected from social media for 25 days, to illustrate how digital distractions fragment our attention and induce stress. Newport proposes a more nuanced approach rather than outright quitting the Internet, advocating for a 'craftsman approach' to select tools that align with our goals. He introduces strategies to critically evaluate social media's impact on our lives, urging readers to consider whether the small benefits of these platforms outweigh their substantial negatives. Ultimately, by reassessing our relationship with these tools, we can better allocate our time and attention towards deeper work.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"An individual detaching from a web of digital distractions, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a serene and timeless setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, deep blue, soft gold, muted cream, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"Reflective and serene","overlay_opacity":50,"blur_strength":10,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-SemiBold.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Embracing Disconnection","section_body":"Baratunde Thurston's 25-day social media break marked a transformative experiment into the void left by digital distractions.
