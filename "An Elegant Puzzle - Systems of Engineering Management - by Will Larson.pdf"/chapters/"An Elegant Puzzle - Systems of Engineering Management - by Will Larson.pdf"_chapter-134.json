{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":134,"chapter_title":"CHALLENGES","summary":"In this chapter, we explore the complexities of introducing new roles within an organization. Key challenges include the perception of new roles as inferior, leading to a lack of empowerment. Organizational brittleness emerges as specialized roles create single points of failure. Additionally, pattern matching from previous experiences can cloud judgment during role design. Finally, the tendency to offload tasks onto new roles can overwhelm them, often leaving their true value unrecognized. Overall, a thoughtful framework is proposed to navigate these challenges effectively.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Navigating the intricacies of role creation in an organization, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, #EDE4D9, #D2BBA0, #BA8B6A, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"systematic and elegant","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#EDE4D9","#D2BBA0","#BA8B6A"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Black.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":5,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"UNDERSTANDING THE PITFALLS OF NEW ROLES","section_body":"When introducing new roles, recognizing potential pitfalls is essential.
