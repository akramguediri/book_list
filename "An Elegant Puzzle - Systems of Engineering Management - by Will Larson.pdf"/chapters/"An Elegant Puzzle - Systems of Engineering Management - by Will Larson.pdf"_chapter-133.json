{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"engineering management","chapter_id":133,"chapter_title":"CREATING SPECIALIZED ROLES, LIKE SRE OR TPMS","summary":"This chapter delves into the evolution and importance of specialized roles in engineering, particularly focusing on Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) and Technical Program Managers (TPMs). The author reflects on his journey from front-end engineering to understanding the nuanced hierarchy of roles within tech teams. With the rise of front-end technologies, perceptions have shifted, yet the hierarchy persists, often influencing role definitions and career paths. The creation of specialized job descriptions and career ladders requires thoughtful design to ensure they serve both the organization and the individuals. Insights from designing Uber's SRE role highlight both achievements and areas for improvement, offering valuable lessons for future role development.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Engineering roles in a tech landscape, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, Navy Blue, Golden Rod, Earthy Brown, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"modern technical aesthetic with a touch of elegance","overlay_opacity":10,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#EDE4D9","#703C3C","#4B2E2B","#C47A4D"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-SemiBold.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Journey of an Engineer","section_body":"Many engineers begin their journey in specific roles and often face biases regarding their contributions.
