A 'falling behind' team experiences low morale and user dissatisfaction, as work accumulates without progress.

Recognizing these states can guide managers in fostering team performance and engagement.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A dynamic team in various states of performance, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, full spectrum of team dynamics, collaborative spirit, overcoming challenges.","style":"modern organizational illustration","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#4B2E2B"],"font_primary":"Arial","font_secondary":"Helvetica","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"UNDERSTANDING TEAM PERFORMANCE","section_body":"Performance is a crucial aspect of any team’s journey.
