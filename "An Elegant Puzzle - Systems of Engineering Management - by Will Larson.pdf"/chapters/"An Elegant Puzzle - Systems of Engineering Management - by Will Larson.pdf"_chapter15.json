{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":15,"chapter_title":"SHIFT SCOPE; ROTATE","summary":"In this chapter, the author emphasizes the importance of managing organizational throughput by strategically shifting workload between teams instead of relocating personnel. This approach minimizes disruption and leverages existing team dynamics, allowing for a more effective optimization of resources. The author suggests that instead of moving people quickly between teams, shifting tasks can be less disruptive and preserve the team's identity. Additionally, rotating individuals for fixed periods can help assess team slack while maintaining their connection to their original teams. Overall, the chapter highlights the flexibility in organizational design and the various viable approaches to enhancing team productivity.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Create an image that embodies the strategic elegance of team restructuring within organizations, showcasing a harmonious balance of accountability and fluidity.
