{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":5,"chapter_title":"SIZING TEAMS","summary":"In this chapter, Will Larson delves into the crucial aspect of team sizing within organizations. He highlights the challenges faced when transitioning from supporting individuals to overseeing teams, emphasizing the importance of optimal team sizes for effective management. Larson provides a framework for determining ideal team sizes, suggesting that managers should oversee six to eight engineers and managers-of-managers should support four to six managers. He argues against small teams, stating that teams with fewer than four members lack the necessary cohesion to innovate and maintain productivity. Additionally, he stresses the significance of avoiding the creation of empty teams and maintaining a balance between innovation and maintenance within existing teams.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A dynamic organizational structure with engineers collaborating, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, soft ivory, warm beige, earthy terracotta, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"collaborative organization","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#9B643D"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Challenge of Team Sizing","section_body":"As we transition from managing individuals to overseeing teams, new challenges emerge.
