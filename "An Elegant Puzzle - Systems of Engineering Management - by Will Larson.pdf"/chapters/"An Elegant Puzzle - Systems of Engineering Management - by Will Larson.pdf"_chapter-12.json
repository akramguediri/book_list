{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":12,"chapter_title":"TEAM FIRST","summary":"In this chapter, the author argues against the practice of reallocating team members from high-performing teams to address shifting global priorities. He emphasizes that disbanding these teams can lead to a substantial decrease in productivity, regardless of whether the individual members are retained elsewhere in the organization.
