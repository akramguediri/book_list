{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":70,"chapter_title":"WORK THE POLICY","summary":"In this chapter, the importance of focusing on policies rather than exceptions is emphasized. When exceptions arise, they should be viewed as opportunities to reevaluate and strengthen existing policies. By collecting escalations as test cases, leaders can create fair and consistent environments while avoiding one-off solutions. It's essential to establish a timeline for policy reviews to assess their effectiveness before any modifications. Ultimately, shifting from handling exceptions to improving policies fosters trust within teams and enhances efficiency.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A team collaboratively strategizing around a large table, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, beige, brown, deep green, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"team collaboration and policy formulation","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#4B2E2B"],"font_primary":"BluuNext-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Shift Focus from Exceptions to Policy.","section_body":"When faced with numerous exceptions, prioritize refining policies rather than continuously addressing one-off issues.
