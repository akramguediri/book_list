{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":42,"chapter_title":"RUNNING GOOD MIGRATIONS","summary":"Migrations are an essential tool for managing technical debt and achieving long-term capacity in engineering systems. While they come with inherent challenges, a well-defined playbook can facilitate effective migrations. The process involves three phases: de-risking, enabling, and finishing migrations. Proper de-risking ensures that all teams are on board and confident in moving forward. Creating self-service tooling and empowering teams will aid in successful migrations, while recognition at the end of the process boosts morale and motivates participation. Embracing this structured approach can lead to a significant reduction in technical debt and an increase in overall system capacity.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Migration journey and teamwork, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, Deep River, Clay, Cream, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"modern engineering and transformation","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#4B2E2B"],"font_primary":"Panchang-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Regular.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Understanding the Need for Migrations","section_body":"Migrations serve as a necessary mechanism for managing technical debt within growing systems. The trade-off for short-term contributions is more capacity and effectiveness in the future. Companies must grapple with the complexities of executing migrations at scale, often leading to a reluctance to prioritize them.","quote":"Migrations occupy the awkward territory of reduced immediate contribution today in exchange for more capacity tomorrow."},{"id":2,"section_title":"The Controversy of Scheduling Migrations","section_body":"Scheduling migrations can be contentious, especially when larger systems make them more expensive. As technical demands grow, teams often find their resources fully consumed by migration efforts, leading to stagnation and technical debt.","quote":"Many midsize companies have a long queue of migrations that they can’t staff."},{"id":3,"section_title":"De-risking the Migration Process","section_body":"The first phase in a successful migration involves de-risking, which requires thorough documentation and team collaboration. Iterative design and feedback from challenging teams are crucial to validate the migration before proceeding.","quote":"Effective de-risking is essential, as each team participating is making a bet on your ability to deliver."},{"id":4,"section_title":"Building Tools and Self-service Capacity","section_body":"With the solution validated, it's time to develop tools that simplify the migration process. Automating the easiest parts and providing documentation will enable teams to proceed confidently, reducing the overall migration cost.","quote":"Spending an extra two days intentionally improving your tools can save years in large migrations."},{"id":5,"section_title":"The Importance of Documentation","section_body":"Clear and intuitive documentation empowers teams to successfully navigate the migration process. Continuous refinement of instructional materials based on team interactions will lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness.","quote":"Documentation and self-service tooling are products that thrive under the same regime."},{"id":6,"section_title":"Finishing the Migration","section_body":"Completing a migration entails ensuring 100% adoption of the new system. Start by enacting changes that prevent new code from being written to the legacy system, ensuring that teams focus their efforts on the new approach.","quote":"Stopping the bleeding ensures that instead of falling behind, you are making progress by default."},{"id":7,"section_title":"Tracking Progress and Communication","section_body":"Establish mechanisms that keep teams informed about migration statuses. Management must prioritize migrations, as teams often lack motivation without leadership support.","quote":"Giving wider management context around migrations is essential for prioritization."},{"id":8,"section_title":"Addressing the Long Tail of Migration Work","section_body":"Migration does not end with initial adoption; the long tail of uncompleted tasks remains. The team must engage directly with the challenging tasks to ensure all aspects of the migration are thoroughly executed.","quote":"Getting to 100 percent will require the team leading the migration to dig into the nooks and crannies themselves."},{"id":9,"section_title":"Celebrating Migration Success","section_body":"While ongoing migrations should be acknowledged, the majority of recognition should occur at their successful completion. Avoiding incomplete migrations helps mitigate technical debt and positively reinforces efforts.","quote":"Celebrating migrations is crucial, but recognition should focus on their successful completion."},{"id":10,"section_title":"The Path Forward","section_body":"With effective strategies for running migrations, teams can significantly reduce their technical debt and increase capacity. Embracing migrations as a structured process promotes long-term health and growth for engineering teams.","quote":"Embrace the structured approach to migrations for a healthier, more scalable engineering future."}]}
