He emphasizes that most people are average at many things, and even those who excel in one area often struggle in others. The pervasive access to extraordinary achievements through media creates a false sense of inadequacy among individuals, overshadowing the value of ordinary experiences. Manson argues that this constant barrage of exceptionalism can lead to insecurity and dissatisfaction. Ultimately, embracing our average nature can liberate us from the tyranny of expectation.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A person standing in a crowd of average individuals, contrasting with an extravagant backdrop of media headlines and celebrity images, Natural park setting, Soft golden hour lighting, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, #EDE4D9, Reflective, Minimalistic Art, Digital Art, Wide-angle perspective --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"Contrasting the ordinary with the extraordinary","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":10,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#EDE4D9"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":5,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Most of us are pretty average.","section_body":"In a world that celebrates exceptionalism, we seldom recognize that being average is the norm for most people.
