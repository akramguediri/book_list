{"book_name":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a  F_ck - by Mark Manson.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":32,"chapter_title":"KILL YOURSELF","summary":"This chapter challenges the conventional notions of self-identity by suggesting that our understanding of who we are is merely a mental construct. Buddhism teaches that by letting go of this constructed self, we can free ourselves to take action and embrace failure as a part of personal growth. When we stop clinging to identities that bind us, we open ourselves to new possibilities and can create authentic paths for our lives. Furthermore, it highlights the collective nature of human struggles and encourages us not to see ourselves as uniquely burdened by problems, but rather as part of the universal human experience. This shift in perspective leads to liberation from fear and self-absorption.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A person meditating in a serene environment, a peaceful landscape, soft golden hour lighting, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, #EDE4D9, Calmness, Minimalism, Digital Art, Wide-angle lens --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"Minimalist and contemplative reflecting liberation and tranquility","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#EDE4D9"],"font_primary":"Panchang-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Regular.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":5,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Illusion of Self","section_body":"Our understandings of identity are often nothing more than illusions, shaped by arbitrary metrics.
