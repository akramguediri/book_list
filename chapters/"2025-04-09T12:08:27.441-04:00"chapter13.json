{"book_name":"the48laws","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":13,"chapter_title":"LAW 13 - WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE’S SELF-INTEREST, NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE","summary":"When seeking assistance, focus on what the other party stands to gain rather than on past favors or pleas for mercy. Historical examples, like Castruccio Castracani's rise and the interactions between Corcyra and Corinth, highlight the failure of emotional appeals and gratitude when self-interest is at stake. Instead, successful persuasion hinges on an understanding of the other person’s motivations and a clear presentation of mutual benefits. Those who ignore this principle often suffer dire consequences. Recognizing and appealing to self-interest can turn the tide in your favor when requesting help.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Cinematic visual style with solemn undertones, reflecting ambition and manipulation; infused with dark, moody lighting and textures reminiscent of ancient frescoes.
