{"book_name":"Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":41,"chapter_title":"BOUNDARY INJURIES: WHAT GOES WRONG?","summary":"In this chapter, we explore how boundary problems originate from early life encounters and traumatic experiences that shape our ability to assert ourselves. Boundary injuries occur primarily during the crucial stages of separation and individuation in childhood. The emotional withdrawal of parents and their hostility when faced with a child’s independence lead to deep-rooted issues in adult relationships. Children who experience a lack of limits or inconsistent parenting often grow up confused about boundaries. Ultimately, these injuries manifest as anxiety, depression, and difficulties in forming healthy relationships, emphasizing the importance of healthy boundary development during childhood.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"depicting boundary injuries in childhood development, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, emotional complexity, soothing pastels, dark earth tones, ultra-detailed, 8k","style":"classical art-inspired, emotionally resonant","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":10,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#1D1D1D"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Black.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-Regular.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Understanding Boundary Development","section_body":"Boundary problems often stem from numerous interactions in our early years.
