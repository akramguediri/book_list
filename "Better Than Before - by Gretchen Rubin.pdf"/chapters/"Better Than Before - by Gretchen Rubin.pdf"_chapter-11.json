The four types are Upholders, who readily meet both inner and outer expectations; Questioners, who only comply if they find the expectation justified; Obligers, who meet outer expectations but struggle with inner ones; and Rebels, who resist all forms of obligation. Understanding these tendencies helps individuals navigate their own habits and interactions with others. Recognizing one's tendency can lead to more effective habit formation and deeper self-knowledge.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"An individual reflecting on their habits, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, deep forest green, dusty rose, soft taupe, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"elegant and introspective","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#C47A4D","#BA8B6A","#E5C29F"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Black.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#C47A4D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Importance of Self-Knowledge","section_body":"Understanding oneself is crucial for habit formation.
