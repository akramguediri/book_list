The historical example of Thomas Cromwell’s rapid reforms under King Henry VIII illustrates that abrupt change can provoke resentment and backlash, leading to chaos. The text advises a careful approach to reform, suggesting that changes should feel like improvements upon the familiar rather than a complete overhaul. Leaders must cloak their reforms in the comforting garments of tradition to navigate human conservatism. Ultimately, the chapter concludes that the past must be utilized strategically to ensure acceptance of necessary change.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Historical reenactment style combined with a modern artistic flair, featuring rich baroque settings that intertwine with contemporary minimalism.
