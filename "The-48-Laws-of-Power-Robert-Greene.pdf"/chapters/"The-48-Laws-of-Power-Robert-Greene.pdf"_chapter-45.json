While change is essential for growth, excessive reform can provoke anxiety and resentment among those who cling to familiar routines. Historical examples, such as Thomas Cromwell's drastic reforms in England, illustrate how rapid changes can lead to unrest and backlash. Greene highlights the importance of cloaking change in the comfort of the past to ease transitions. The chapter serves as a reminder that while progress is necessary, it should be implemented thoughtfully to avoid chaos.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A regal figure representing leadership inspired by Thomas Cromwell, a renaissance chamber with old books and artifacts, warm candlelight illuminating the environment, [#B8C3A8, #D9B4A6, #BA8B6A], reflective, classical painting style, oil painting, close-up portrait with warm focus --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"historical elegance","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#B8C3A8","#D9B4A6","#BA8B6A"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"EBGaramond12-Regular.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"THE NEED FOR CHANGE IS UNIVERSAL","section_body":"Everyone acknowledges the necessity for change, yet in their daily lives, people are deeply resistant to it.
