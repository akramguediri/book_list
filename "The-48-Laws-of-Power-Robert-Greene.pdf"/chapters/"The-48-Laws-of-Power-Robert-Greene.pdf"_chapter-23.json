By withdrawing from situations or relationships, one can create scarcity, which in turn heightens their value in the eyes of others. Through historical examples and narratives, Greene emphasizes that an overabundance of presence can lead to devaluation, while strategic absence fosters longing and respect. The chapter demonstrates that true power lies not in constant visibility, but in the ability to create a captivating aura of mystery. Absence, therefore, becomes a calculated strategy to maintain influence and allure.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A knight with a withdrawn demeanor in a castle courtyard, mystifying shadows, warm sunset glow, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, #BA8B6A, contemplative, realistic, digital painting, close-up capturing emotional depth --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"medieval romanticism","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#BA8B6A"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Light.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Value is Found in Scarcity","section_body":"When you are constantly present, you risk becoming commonplace.
