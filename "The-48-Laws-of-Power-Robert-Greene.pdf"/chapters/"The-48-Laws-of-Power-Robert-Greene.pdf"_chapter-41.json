He illustrates how Louis-Philippe, a former king, lost his power by downplaying his royalty and mingling too casually with the people. Through historical examples like Columbus and the lessons from kingship, Greene highlights that one's self-image and confidence involve taking on a regal posture, inspiring respect through dignity. By embodying a quality that reflects greatness, people are often treated as if they are destined for it. Ultimately, to command respect, one must act as a king, regardless of their actual status.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Kingly figure exuding confidence, regal environment with castle backdrop, soft lighting with highlights, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, #E6E5D7, serene mood, classical art style, digital painting, focused on the subject with blurred background --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"regal and majestic","overlay_opacity":50,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#E6E5D7"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-Regular.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Power of Self-Respect","section_body":"How you carry yourself influences how others perceive and treat you.
