{"book_name":"The Power of Now - A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment - by Eckhart Tolle.pdf","genre":"spirituality","chapter_id":66,"chapter_title":"THE SOURCE OF CHI","summary":"In 'The Source of Chi', Eckhart Tolle invites us to explore the realm of pure Being, which liberates us from our identification with physical forms. This formless state, referred to as the Unmanifested, represents deep stillness, peace, and vibrant joy. Tolle distinguishes chi as the inner energy field of our body that connects us with the Unmanifested, serving as the bridge between our physical existence and the source of all life. By immersing ourselves in this inner energy, we can feel the flow of life and discover our true essence. This chapter encourages us to transcend the physical limitations and embrace the aliveness that comes from the Unmanifested.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Figure meditating in tranquil surroundings, serene nature, soft natural light, #E6E5D7, #9B643D, #3B3A3F, peaceful, watercolor, digital painting, high-resolution --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"Serene and introspective","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#E6E5D7","#9B643D","#3B3A3F"],"font_primary":"Arial","font_secondary":"Courier New","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":5,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Enter the Realm of Pure Being","section_body":"To access the realm of pure Being, find a calm space and remain in this state as long as feels comfortable.
