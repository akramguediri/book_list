{"book_name":"The Power of Now - A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment - by Eckhart Tolle.pdf","genre":"spirituality","chapter_id":79,"chapter_title":"WHY WOMEN ARE CLOSER TO ENLIGHTENMENT","summary":"This chapter explores the inherent differences in how men and women approach enlightenment. Women, being more connected to their emotions and bodies, are often closer to the state of Being, which is essential for enlightenment. The author discusses how emotional pain can serve as a doorway for awakening and presence in relationships. He emphasizes the qualities of surrender and openness associated with the feminine principle and contrasts it with the rigid energy of the mind often associated with masculinity. Ultimately, both men and women hold the potential to access deeper consciousness, even if societal constructs have historically favored a male-dominated view of divinity.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A woman embodying serenity, inside a peaceful room with soft natural light filtering through a window, [#D2BBA0], [#4B2E2B], [#E5C29F], calm and reflective mood, minimalist art style, digital illustration, portrait photography with soft focus --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"serene and reflective","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#4B2E2B","#E5C29F"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Medium.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Disguised Opportunities in Relationships","section_body":"Every challenge in a relationship can open doors to higher consciousness.
