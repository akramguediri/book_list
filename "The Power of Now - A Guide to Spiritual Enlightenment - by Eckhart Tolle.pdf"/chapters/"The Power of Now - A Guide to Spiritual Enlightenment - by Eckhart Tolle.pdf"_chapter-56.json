{"book_name":"The Power of Now - A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment - by Eckhart Tolle.pdf","genre":"spirituality","chapter_id":56,"chapter_title":"HAVE DEEP ROOTS WITHIN","summary":"This chapter emphasizes the importance of connecting deeply with your inner body to access the Source of spiritual truth within oneself. Tolle suggests that while the physical body is often perceived as a representation of reality, it is merely an illusion, and true essence lies within. By maintaining awareness of the inner body, one can remain anchored in the present, diminishing the influence of thoughts and emotions. The practice of inner-body awareness transforms consciousness and enhances life experience. Ultimately, this deep-rooted connection fosters a state of unshakeable peace and presence.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Inner Body Awareness, Calm Natural Environment, Soft Ambient Lighting, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, #E6E5D7, Peaceful, Minimalist, Digital Art, Close-up Shot --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"serene and grounding","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#E6E5D7"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Spiritual Truth is Within Everyone","section_body":"Every spiritual teaching springs from the same profound Source.
