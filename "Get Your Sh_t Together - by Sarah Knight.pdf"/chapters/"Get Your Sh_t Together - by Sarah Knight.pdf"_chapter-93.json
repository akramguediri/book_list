She argues that pursuing personal hobbies and passions can be seen as a form of selfishness, but it's a necessary practice for personal happiness and fulfillment. Knight illustrates how being selfish in this sense can improve your relationships and overall well-being. She challenges societal norms that dictate the stigma against prioritizing oneself, showing that success can manifest in different forms beyond societal expectations. Ultimately, happiness should be a goal in and of itself, not merely a byproduct of meeting others' demands.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A serene artist's studio filled with creative tools, symbolically rich, in a timeless setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, creative energy, warm beige, calm green, faded peach, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"Artistic and inspirational","overlay_opacity":10,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#B8C3A8","#E6E5D7"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":5,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Embrace Your Creative Urge.","section_body":"Recognizing when inspiration strikes is crucial for creatives.
