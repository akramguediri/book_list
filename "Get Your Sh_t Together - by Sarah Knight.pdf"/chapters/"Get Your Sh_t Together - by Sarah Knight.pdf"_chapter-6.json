Ultimately, understanding which type you resonate with can help in the journey towards getting your sh_t together.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A bustling urban scene showing different people representing the archetypes—one overwhelmed, one distracted, and one seemingly perfect yet stressed—emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, vibrant, calming, earthy, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"modern yet classical storytelling","overlay_opacity":15,"blur_strength":3,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#BA8B6A"],"font_primary":"BluuNext-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Regular.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"INTRODUCING THE ARCHETYPE OF FAILURE","section_body":"Many people struggle with keeping their lives organized.
