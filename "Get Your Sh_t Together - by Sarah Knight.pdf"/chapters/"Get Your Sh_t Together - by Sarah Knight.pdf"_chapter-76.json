{"book_name":"Get Your Sh_t Together - by Sarah Knight.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":76,"chapter_title":"NOBODY’S GOING TO DIE ON THE TABLE","summary":"This chapter emphasizes the importance of delegating tasks and disconnecting from work to protect your personal time. Delegation is not about how the task gets done, but ensuring that it gets done while allowing yourself the freedom to enjoy life. Setting firm boundaries is essential, especially during vacations, where one must fully disconnect from work-related responsibilities. Knight humorously reminds us that, unlike surgical emergencies, most work tasks can wait. Ultimately, by learning to delegate and truly unwind, we can reclaim our time and peace of mind.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A serene beach scene with a person relaxing under a cabana, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, sandy beige, ocean blue, sunset orange, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"Relaxation and Freedom","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#D9B4A6"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#D2BBA0","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Delegation is key to freedom.","section_body":"Learning to delegate allows us to focus on what truly matters.
