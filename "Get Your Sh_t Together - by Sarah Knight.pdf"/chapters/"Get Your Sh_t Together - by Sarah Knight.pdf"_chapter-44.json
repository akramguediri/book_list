By limiting email checks to two times a day, you can mitigate the interruption of constant notifications and instead prioritize focus on critical tasks. The concept of 'dialing in' offers a humorous yet effective strategy to prioritize communications, suggesting that many inquiries might resolve themselves in your absence. This approach fosters a healthier relationship with technology and helps reclaim time for deeper work. Effectively, Knight encourages us to choose when and how we engage with others to minimize unnecessary stress.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"a serene workspace with an old dial-up modem, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, Olive Garden, warm beige, deep green, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"serene and nostalgic","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#1D1D1D"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-Regular.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":5,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"INTRODUCTION TO INBOX ANXIETY","section_body":"In the digital age, inbox anxiety can be overwhelming.
