This principle explains why certain habits become easier or more appealing over time while others fade. The author emphasizes the importance of reducing friction around positive behaviors and increasing it around negative ones to facilitate habit formation. Practical strategies are provided to design environments that support healthy habits and minimize obstacles. Ultimately, the chapter underscores that by making good choices easier, we are more likely to achieve our desired outcomes.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Human behavior patterns, a vibrant farm landscape, warm sunlight, #EDE4D9, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, Inspirational, Digital painting, Illustration, Close-up of colorful fields and plants, focus on ease of growth","style":"natural and uplifting","overlay_opacity":50,"blur_strength":10,"color_palette":["#EDE4D9","#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Black.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-SemiBold.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Understanding the Law of Least Effort","section_body":"The Law of Least Effort states that people naturally choose the path that requires the least amount of work.
