{"book_name":"Atomic_Habits.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":11,"chapter_title":"WALK SLOWLY, BUT NEVER BACKWARD","summary":"In this chapter, the importance of action over mere motion is highlighted through an analogy of two groups of photography students. One group focused on quantity and learned by doing, while the other group focused on quality but failed to produce results. This illustrates that planning and strategizing can lead to procrastination rather than progress. Repetition is key to habit formation, as the brain adapts through consistent practice, making actions more automatic. Ultimately, it's the frequency of actions that solidifies habits, not merely the passage of time.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Photography students engaged in creative processes, a classroom setting, natural lighting, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, #BA8B6A, contemplative mood, sketchy style, digital art, 50mm lens --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"inspired by learning and creativity","overlay_opacity":25,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#BA8B6A"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-Regular.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"EMBRACE THE JOURNEY OF ACTION","section_body":"Success in any endeavor begins with taking action.
