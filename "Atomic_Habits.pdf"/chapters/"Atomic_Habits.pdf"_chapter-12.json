{"book_name":"Atomic_Habits.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":5,"chapter_title":"THE BEST WAY TO START A NEW HABIT","summary":"This chapter emphasizes the importance of planning when and where to perform new habits through strategies known as implementation intentions and habit stacking. Research suggests that people who make specific plans are more likely to succeed in developing new habits than those who rely solely on motivation. By defining a clear action plan—such as filling out the sentence 'I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]'—individuals can eliminate ambiguity and improve commitment. Habit stacking allows individuals to link new behaviors with existing ones, creating a momentum that facilitates habit formation. Overall, specificity and planning are vital for turning intentions into actions and achieving lasting change.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Habit formation and implementation intentions, an organized workspace, bright and inviting lighting, [#D2BBA0, #BA8B6A, #1E2C27], motivational, modern graphic design, digital art, high-resolution image --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"motivational and modern","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#BA8B6A","#1E2C27"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Black.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-Regular.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Power of Planning","section_body":"Success in developing new habits relies heavily on having a concrete plan.
