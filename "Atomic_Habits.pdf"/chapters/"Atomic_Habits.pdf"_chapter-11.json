{"book_name":"Atomic_Habits.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":4,"chapter_title":"THE MAN WHO DIDN’T LOOK RIGHT","summary":"In this chapter, the author delves into the profound insights of intuition and awareness as learned from experiences. The story of a paramedic recognizing a critical health issue highlights how our brains can pick up cues that lead to predictions about outcomes. As habits form, they become automatic, causing us to overlook the triggers and patterns behind our actions. To foster change, one must first build awareness around these habits, exemplified through strategies like Pointing-and-Calling and utilizing a Habits Scorecard. This awareness is the key to transforming our behaviors intentionally rather than allowing them to run on autopilot.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A brain analyzing cues, clinical environment, soft natural lighting, #EDE4D9, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, calm, minimalism, digital painting, shallow depth of field --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"professional and clean","overlay_opacity":75,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#EDE4D9","#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#1D1D1D","#9B643D","#4B2E2B","#C47A4D","#703C3C","#BA8B6A","#B8C3A8","#6A5D4D","#2E4A3B","#E6E5D7","#1E2C27","#1A2A40","#786D85","#D9B4A6","#E5C29F","#8C3F3F"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Power of Intuition in Crisis","section_body":"A paramedic's instinct saves her father-in-law from a heart attack, demonstrating how trained intuition can recognize life-threatening cues.
