To reach this goal with the fourteenth edition of our  \nmarket-leading text, we again present you with an intellectually rich yet thoroughly practical  \nanalysis of strategic management.\nBefore we began working on this new edition, we had a series of meetings in which we created \na comprehensive list of topics that needed to be added or revised significantly because of monu-\nmental changes in the global business, social, technological, and political environments over the \nrecent past, as well as developments in the academic and practitioner literatures pertaining to \nstrategic management. After creating the list, we thoroughly examined these literatures, which led \nus to research articles from journals published on six continents and a wide assortment of articles \npublished in the popular business press (e.g., Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Businessweek, Fortune, \nFinancial Times, and Forbes, to name a few) and in reliable social media outlets (i.e., blogs associ-\nated with professional organizations). \nThe goal was to ensure that the material in the book is accurate, interesting, and reflects the \nmost important developments in the business world. This process resulted in the inclusion of 1,507 \nreferences to works published since the last edition went to press (485 in 2022; 567 in 2021; 305 in \n2020; 153 in 2019).\nExamining a wide array of sources provided many valuable examples of how companies across \nthe world are using (or not using) the strategic management process. Though many of the hun-\ndreds of companies discussed in the book will be familiar to you, some will likely be new. One \nreason for this diversity is that the book contains examples of companies from around the world \nto demonstrate the globalized nature of business operations. Some of these firms are fairly large \nand known by many, while others are small and known primarily to the customers they serve. To \nfacilitate learning, the book uses an Analysis-Strategy-Performance framework; we explain this \nframework in Chapter 1 and reference it throughout the book.\nSeveral characteristics of this fourteenth edition are designed to enhance your learning \nexperience:\n\t\n●\nFirst, this book presents you with the most comprehensive and thorough coverage of strategic \nmanagement available in the market.\n\t\n●\nThe research used in this book includes “classics” as well as the most recent contributions \nto strategic management literature. The historically significant classic research provides the \nfoundation for much of what we know about strategic management, while the most recent \ncontributions reveal insights about how to use strategic management effectively in the com-\nplex, global business environment in which firms compete. Although the relevant theory and \ncurrent research are the foundation for this book, it also is strongly application oriented and \npresents you with numerous examples and applications of strategic management concepts, \ntechniques, and tools. This edition, for example, uses more than 600 companies to illustrate \nstrategic management in action. Collectively, no other strategic management book presents \nyou with the combination of useful and insightful research and applications in diverse organi-\nzations as does this text.\n\t\n●\nExamples you will find in this edition include large U.S.-based firms such as Tesla, Meta  \nPlatforms, BlackRock, Costco, Apple, McDonald’s, FedEx, Starbucks, Walmart, Walt Disney, \nGeneral Electric, Intel, Coca-Cola, Netflix, Tupperware, Shaw Industries, Instacart, Harley- \nDavidson, Patagonia, Publix, Peloton, Kroger, Campbell Soup, Fanatics, Frontier Airlines, \nAccenture, Pfizer, Google, Target, UPS, Bed Bath & Beyond, and many more.\n\t\n●\nIn addition, examples of firms based in countries other than the United States include Toshiba, \nAirbus, Sony, Carrefour, Softbank, Nestlé, Piclo Flex, Tata Group, Rio Tinto Group, Unilever, \nIKEA, Komatsu, Toyota, Aldi, Honda, Groupe Limagrain, Alibaba, Lenovo, Volkswagen, and \nSamsung. As these lists suggest, the firms this book examines compete in a wide range of \nindustries and produce a diverse set of goods and services.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.\n\nPreface\nxv\n\t\n●\nThe ideas of many prominent scholars are included in this book, including Ron Adner, \nRajshree Agarwal, Ruth Aguilera, Gautam Ahuja, Raffi Amit, Africa Arino, Jay Barney, Paul \nBeamish, Peter Buckley, Alfred Chandler, Ming-Jer Chen, Russ Coff, Brian Connelly, Rich \nD’Aveni, Kathy Eisenhardt, Nicolas Foss, Edward Freeman, Gerry George, Javier Gimeno, Luis \nGomez-Mejia, Melissa Graebner, Ranjay Gulati, Don Hambrick, Joseph Harrison, Connie \nHelfat, Amy Hillman, Tomas Hult, Tom Jones, Dave Ketchen, Ryan Krause, Dovev Lavie,  \nHaiyang, Li, Yadong Luo, Shige Makino, Costas Markides, Anita McGahan, Danny Miller, Will \nMitchell, Margie Peteraf, Michael Porter, Nandini Rajagopalan, Jeff Reuer, Joan Ricart, Richard \nRumelt, Wei Shi, David Sirmon, Ken Smith, Steve Tallman, David Teece, Rosalie Tung, Michael \nTushman, Eero Vaara, Margarethe Wiersema, Oliver Williamson, Mike Wright, Anthea Zhang, \nShaker Zahara, and Ed Zajac, among many others. \nIn addition to the book’s characteristics, let us highlight some specific features and revisions:\n\t\n●\nNew Opening Cases and Strategic Focus Segments Almost all of the Opening Cases and Stra-\ntegic Focus segments are new! A very few were updated completely because of their continuing \nrelevance and importance. Many of these application-oriented features deal with companies \nlocated outside North America. In addition, the company-specific examples included in each \nchapter are either new or were checked for their continuing relevance and accuracy. \n\t\n●\nTwenty-two New Cases are included in this edition. Offering an effective mix of organizations \nheadquartered or based in North America and several other countries as well, the cases deal \nwith contemporary and highly important strategic management topics. Many of the cases have \nfull financial data. These timely cases present active learners with opportunities to apply the \nstrategic management process and understand organizational conditions and contexts and to \nmake appropriate recommendations to deal with critical concerns. These cases also appear in \nMindTap (see description below).\n\t\n●\nNew Mini-Cases appear at the end of each chapter. These cases describe how companies deal \nwith major issues the text highlights. The book includes 13 of these cases, one for each chapter, \nalthough some of them can overlap with other chapter content. Students will like their concise-\nness, but they likewise provide rich content that can serve as a catalyst for individual or group \nanalysis and class discussion. A set of questions, which guide analysis and discussion, follows \neach Mini-Case.\n\t\n●\nCompletely new or expanded content appears in all of the chapters to reflect the many changes \ncurrently taking place in strategic management. Much of this content pertains to ideas found in \nmore than one chapter. Consequently, you will find in the book a continuing, integrated thread \nfor these topics, with references back to the place they were mentioned or defined initially. \nChapter 1 introduces many of the new concepts because it lays a foundation for the rest of the \nbook; however, most of them receive thorough treatment in a later chapter. Examples of this \ncontent, and the chapters in which it can be found, include:\n\t\n●\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainability, ESG, and greenwashing (Chapters 1, \n2, 6, 8–13)\n\t\n●\nNonmarket strategies and social capital (Chapters 2, 3, 5)\n\t\n●\nEcosystems, platform strategies, multi-party alliances, and coopetition (Chapters 2, 5, 9)\n\t\n●\nDeglobalization and protectionism (Chapters 1, 8)\n\t\n●\nDigitalization, digital strategies, big data, and the metaverse (Chapters 1, 2, 4–9, 13)\n\t\n●\nBenefit corporations and B-Corp certification (Chapters 2, 10)\n\t\n●\nStakeholder perspective and stakeholder-oriented strategic management (Chapters 1, 6,  \n10, 12) \n\t\n●\nGlobal supply chains and global value chains (Chapters 1, 8)\n\t\n●\nCryptocurrencies and blockchain (Chapters 2, 13)\n\t\n●\nArtificial intelligence (Chapters 1, 3)\n\t\n●\nDigital platform organizations and structure (Chapters 4, 8, 11)\n\t\n●\nCross-border learning (Chapter 8) \n\t\n●\nInflation (Chapters 2, 8)\n\t\n●\nGlobal conflict and war (Chapters 2, 8)\n\t\n●\nGlobal pandemic, COVID-19 (Chapters 1–5, 8)\n\t\n●\nActivist investors and investor “wolf-packs” (Chapters 6, 7, 10)\n\t\n●\nStrategic human capital (Chapters 3, 4)\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The content has \nnot only the best research documentation but also the largest number of effective real-world \nexamples to help active learners understand the different types of strategies organizations use \nto achieve their vision and mission and to seek to outperform rivals.\nSupplements to Accompany This Text\nMindTap.

Strategic \nmanagement is taught at both undergraduate and graduate levels, and therefore, we offer a vari-\nety of pedagogically designed activities with numerous challenge levels so that instructors can \ncustomize MindTap to best suit their teaching style and the course objectives. That said, we have \nbeen highly intentional in designing a MindTap learning path that scaffolds learners through the \ncontent and offers a multi-modal experience to serve learners of varying preferences and levels. \nWe have found that our interactive approach to teaching strategic management appeals to stu-\ndents. It also greatly improves the quality of their learning experience. Our approach is more fully \ndiscussed in the Instructor’s Resource Manual.\nTeaching and Learning Aids\nInstructor Website.

Called Rent-a-Car, Inc., the company grew rapidly and \nwas purchased by John D. Hertz, owner of Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing \nCompany, in 1923. He re-named the company Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System. After three \nyears, the rental car brand was sold to General Motors, which sold the brand back to \nJohn Hertz in 1953. The company’s stock began trading on the New York Stock Ex-\nchange in 1954. Over the years the company has been owned, in addition to General \nMotors, by Radio Corporation of America, UAL Corporation (later known as Allegis), \nFord Motor Company, and a consortium of private equity firms, which ultimately took \nthe company public again in 2006.\nIn spite of, or perhaps because of, all the changes in ownership, Hertz has a \nhistory of innovation. It was the first company to offer a rental charge card, the first \nto offer one-way rentals, and the first international car rental company to expand \ninto China. In addition, the company partnered with auto manufacturers to develop \nand rent specialty cars for its fleet, including a Ford GT350H Mustang and a modified \nChevrolet Corvette \nZH-Z coupe. Hertz \nwas an early inno-\nvator in self-service \ncar rental kiosks and \nhourly car rentals. \nThe company also \ngrew through devel-\noping a new brand, \nAdvantage Rent-A-\nCar, and through the \nacquisition of Dollar \nThrifty Automotive \nGroup, after which \nthe Advantage brand \nwas sold. Hertz also \noperates the Firefly \nbrand in interna-\ntional markets. In \nadvertising, Hertz \nwas one of the first \ncompanies to feature \nan African American in \nits commercials.\nThe car rental industry is incredibly competitive. Enterprise Holdings is the largest \ncar rental company in the United States, with over 1 million cars. Internationally, \nEnterprise has nearly 10,000 car rental locations in approximately 100 countries and \nterritories. In comparison, Hertz has approximately 1,500 airport rental locations in the \nUnited States and 2,000 airport rental locations internationally. However, Hertz also has \napproximately 2,400 off-airport locations in the United States and 6,100 off-airport loca-\ntions internationally, which makes the company similar in size to Enterprise. Rounding \nout the largest competitors is Avis Budget Group. These three competitors control over \n90 percent of the rental car business in the United States. Competition in the industry \nis largely based on advertising leading to brand preferences, competitive prices, and \nloyalty programs. Online services such as Priceline.com, Expedia.com, and Kayak.com \nmean that consumers have an information advantage over the car rental companies in \nfinding competitive rates, which keeps prices low. \nIn spite of the pressure to keep prices low, car rental companies still earn profits \nbecause of their business models. Most of them buy new cars in fleets at reduced prices \ndirectly from manufacturers. They keep the cars for only a short amount of time, which \nmakes the cars very attractive to customers and reduces maintenance costs. When they \nsell the cars, because the cars have low mileage and were purchased at a discount, car \nrental companies are able to recoup most or all of the original purchase prices. However,  \nthis business model makes car rental companies vulnerable to steep losses if used car \nprices decline. Car rental companies are also vulnerable to shifts in tourist travel.\n© anilakkus / Getty Images\nJonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.com\nHertz has a long history of being an innovator in the car  \nrental industry\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Tourism dropped to almost nothing, which especially hurt car rental companies \nas well as airlines and hotels. In addition, there was a drop in demand for used cars, which \nmade selling its fleet difficult. Hertz cut jobs and sold a lot of its fleet in an attempt to pay \ncreditors and remain solvent. The company’s sales shrank 46 percent from 2019 to 2020, and \nthe company lost nearly $2 billion. In May 2020, the company was forced to file for Chapter 11 \nbankruptcy to provide some temporary relief from creditors and buy some time to restructure \nits debt and its operations. At one point, Hertz shares were selling for under a dollar.\nIn May of 2021, a group of investors won a bidding contest in bankruptcy court for \ncontrol of the company, with a plan to modernize the company’s technology and improve \ncustomer service. They arranged to have a new issue of Hertz stock begin trading in early \nJuly, the day after the company exited bankruptcy. Then, in the summer of 2021, good for-\ntune smiled on Hertz. With many COVID-19 travel restrictions being lifted, tourism increased \ndramatically. The car rental industry was not prepared for it. Demand outstripped supply of \nrental cars, and it was not unusual for vacationers to pay $275 per day for a SUV in popular \nlocations; $100-per-day rentals on regular cars were common. The restructuring had dra-\nmatically reduced Hertz’s debt burden, so they were well positioned to take advantage of \nthe uptick in demand. \nAs Hertz rebounds, innovation is taking front stage again. The company is buying \n100,000 electric cars from Tesla for its fleet. It also has a partnership with Uber Technolo-\ngies focused on autonomous driving and the possibility of developing robotaxi networks. The \ncompany wants to play a large role in the modern mobility ecosystem (all the firms that carry \nout interdependent activities that provide mobility to customers). In an amazing turnaround \nof fortunes, Barron’s identified Hertz as one of its 10 top stocks for investment in 2022.\nSources: C. English, 2022, Hertz stock could take off this year.

Intense competition among a small group of industry \nleaders, dependence on tourism, and changing technologies are all strong forces in the auto rental \nindustry. A shock like the COVID-19 pandemic had an especially large negative impact on the \nindustry, but what is most fascinating is that lifting travel restrictions also unleashed strong posi-\ntive forces that allowed the industry, and Hertz, to recover. \nFirms achieve strategic competitiveness by successfully formulating and implementing a value- \ncreating strategy. A strategy is an integrated and coordinated set of commitments and actions \ndesigned to exploit core competencies and gain a competitive advantage. When choosing a strat-\negy, firms make choices among competing alternatives as the pathway for deciding how they will \npursue strategic competitiveness. In this sense, the chosen strategy indicates what the firm will do \nas well as what the firm will not do.\nA firm has a competitive advantage when, by implementing a chosen strategy, it creates supe-\nrior value for customers, and when competitors are not able to imitate the value the firm’s prod-\nucts create or find it too expensive to attempt imitation.1 An organization can be confident that \nits strategy yields a competitive advantage after competitors’ efforts to duplicate it have ceased or \nfailed. In addition, firms must understand that no competitive advantage is permanent. The speed \nwith which competitors are able to acquire the skills needed to duplicate the benefits of a firm’s \nvalue-creating strategy determines how long the competitive advantage will last.2 Consider, for \nexample, that although Hertz was often an innovator in the industry, competitors were able to copy \nHertz’s innovations with relative ease, which means that the company could only enjoy a competi-\ntive advantage for a short time. \nLearning Objective\n1-1 Define strategic \ncompetitiveness, \nstrategy, competitive \nadvantage, above-\naverage returns, and the \nstrategic management \nprocess.\nFirms achieve strategic \ncompetitiveness by \nsuccessfully formulating \nand implementing a value \ncreating strategy.\nA strategy is an integrated \nand coordinated set of \ncommitments and actions \ndesigned to exploit core \ncompetencies and gain a \ncompetitive advantage.\nA firm has a competitive \nadvantage when, by \nimplementing a chosen \nstrategy, it creates superior \nvalue for customers, and when \ncompetitors are not able to \nimitate the value the firm’s \nproducts create or find it too \nexpensive to attempt imitation.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In essence, a firm creates a competitive advantage by being as different as \npossible from competitors in ways that are important to customers and in ways that competitors \ncannot duplicate. Important differences are ones for which customers are willing to pay. In the \ncar rental industry, one of the only sustainable sources of competitive advantage is brand name.  \nA well-known brand such as Hertz, Enterprise, or Avis allows these companies to charge a pre-\nmium for their car rentals, in spite of the information advantages that consumers have because of \naccess to car rental websites that list all available options and their prices. This means that some \nof the smaller, less-well-known competitors have to rent their cars at a substantially lower price \nthan the well-known brands.\nAlmost no competitive advantage is sustainable permanently. In some instances, a firm’s \nadvantage no longer creates value for which customers are willing to pay. In other cases, com-\npetitors will learn how to create more value for customers with respect to a valued competitive \ndimension for which they are willing to pay. Thus, to achieve strategic competitiveness across \ntime, a firm must concentrate simultaneously on exploiting the competitive advantage it pos-\nsesses today while contemplating decisions to make to ensure that it will possess a competitive \nadvantage in the future.\nThe success with which firms in an industry formulate and implement their value creating \nstrategies determines whether their performance will be above, at, or below average compared to \ncomparable companies. Above-average returns are returns in excess of what an investor expects \nto earn from other investments with a similar amount of risk. Risk is an investor’s uncertainty \nabout the economic gains or losses that will result from a particular investment. The most success-\nful companies learn how to manage risk effectively; doing so reduces investors’ uncertainty about \nthe outcomes of their investments.3 Firms often use accounting-based metrics, such as return on \nassets, return on equity, and return on sales to assess their performance. Alternatively, firms can \nassess their performance in terms of stock market returns. In smaller, new venture firms, returns \nare sometimes measured in terms of the amount and speed of growth (e.g., annual sales) rather \nthan more traditional profitability measures because new ventures require time to earn acceptable \nreturns for investors.4\nUnderstanding how to exploit a competitive advantage is important for firms seeking to earn \nabove-average returns.5 Firms without a competitive advantage or that do not compete in an attrac-\ntive industry earn, at best, average returns. Average returns are returns equal to those an investor \nexpects to earn from other investments possessing a similar amount of risk. Over time, an inability \nto earn at least average returns results first in decline and, eventually, failure.6 For instance, for a \nwhile Hertz was not able to generate enough returns for a company in such a high-risk industry. As \na result, they were unable to secure the financing needed to remain solvent. This is typical, as failure \noccurs when investors withdraw their investments from firms earning less-than-average returns, \neven if it is an external shock like a pandemic that is the cause of the poor performance.\nThe strategic management process is the full set of commitments, decisions, and actions \nfirms take to achieve strategic competitiveness and earn above-average returns.7 The process \ninvolves analysis, strategy, and performance (the A-S-P model—see Figure 1.1). The firm’s first \nstep in the process is to analyze its external environment and internal organization to identify \nexternal opportunities and threats and to recognize its internal resources, capabilities, and core \ncompetencies. The results of these analyses influence the selection of the firm’s strategy or strate-\ngies. The strategy portion of the model entails strategy formulation and strategy implementation.\nWith the information gained from external and internal analyses, the firm develops its vision, \nmission, and values, and formulates one or more strategies. To implement its strategies, the firm \ntakes actions to enact each one with the intent of achieving strategic competitiveness and above- \naverage returns (performance). Effective actions that take place in the context of integrated strategy \nformulation and implementation efforts result in positive performance. Firms seek to maintain the \nquality of what is a dynamic strategic management process as a means of dealing successfully with \never-changing markets and evolving internal conditions.8 In the remaining chapters of this book, \nwe use the strategic management process to explain what firms do to achieve strategic competitive-\nness and earn above-average returns. We demonstrate why some firms achieve competitive success \nconsistently while others do not. \nAbove-average returns \nare returns in excess of what \nan investor expects to earn \nfrom other investments with \na similar amount of risk.\nRisk is an investor’s \nuncertainty about the \neconomic gains or losses that \nwill result from a particular \ninvestment.\nAverage returns are returns \nequal to those an investor \nexpects to earn from other \ninvestments with a similar \namount of risk.\nThe strategic management \nprocess is the full set of \ncommitments, decisions, \nand actions required for a \nfirm to achieve strategic \ncompetitiveness and earn \nabove-average returns.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

First, we describe the current competitive landscape. Several \nrealities, including the emergence of a global economy, globalization resulting from that econ-\nomy, and rapid technological changes, influence this landscape. Next, we examine three models \nthat firms use to gather the information and knowledge required to choose and then effectively \nimplement their strategies. The first model (industrial organization or I/O) suggests that the \nexternal environment is the primary determinant of a firm’s strategic actions. According to this \nmodel, identifying and then operating effectively in an attractive (i.e., profitable) industry or \nsegment of an industry are the keys to competitive success.9 The second model (resource-based) \nsuggests that a firm’s unique resources and capabilities are the critical link to strategic compet-\nitiveness.10 The third model is based on the notion that the quality of a firm’s relationships with \ninternal and external constituencies (stakeholders) can lead organizations to achieve above- \naverage returns.\nThe information firms gather as they apply the three models helps firms define their purpose, \nas reflected in a mission, vision, and values. After a discussion of missions, visions, and values, we \nclose the chapter with a brief introduction to strategic leadership and the elements of the strategic \nmanagement process.\nChapter 7\nMerger and\nAcquisition\nStrategies\nChapter 4\nBusiness-Level\nStrategy\nChapter 8\nInternational\nStrategy\nChapter 5\nCompetitive\nRivalry and\nCompetitive\nDynamics\nChapter 9\nCooperative\nStrategy\nChapter 6\nCorporate-\nLevel Strategy\nChapter 11\nOrganizational\nStructure and\nControls\nChapter 10\nCorporate\nGovernance\nChapter 12\nStrategic\nLeadership\nStrategic\nCompetitiveness\nAbove-Average\nReturns\nChapter 13\nStrategic\nEntrepreneurship\nAnalysis\nStrategy\nPerformance\nVision\nMission\nValues\nStrategy Implementation\nStrategy Formulation\nChapter 3\nThe Internal\nOrganization\nChapter 2\nThe External\nEnvironment\nFigure 1.1 The Strategic Management Process\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Digitalization, \nfor example, which is the process of converting something to digital form, is a competitive dimen-\nsion that is affecting competition in multiple industries throughout the world. Firms committed \nto becoming digital leaders may be able to distinguish themselves from competitors by producing \ninnovative products that unique groups of customers value. A significant benefit of digitaliza-\ntion is that it allows firms to identify specific customer groups and then serve their personalized \nand unique needs. Also, the rising generation is “always on” through their smartphones, tablets, \ngaming systems, and other media. Thus, in today’s competitive landscape, a challenge is for firms \nto understand the strategic implications associated with digitalization and to integrate digitaliza-\ntion effectively into their strategies. \nIn the current competitive landscape, conventional sources of competitive advantage such as \neconomies of scale and large advertising budgets may not be as effective as they once were in terms \nof helping firms earn above-average returns. The large plants associated with economies of scale \nhave often been replaced with outsourcing to countries where labor rates are low. Advertising on \ntelevision and in magazines or other traditional outlets is less effective because of the dramatic \nincrease in media outlets from which consumers receive entertainment and news, a direct result of \ndigitalization. Consequently, managers in many industries must adopt a mind-set that values flex-\nibility, speed, innovation, integration, and the challenges flowing from constantly changing condi-\ntions.11 The conditions of the competitive landscape result in a perilous business world—a world in \nwhich the investments necessary to compete on a global scale are enormous and the consequences \nof failure are severe.12 Effective use of the strategic management process reduces the likelihood of \nfailure for firms while competing against their rivals. \nHypercompetition is a condition in which competitors engage in intense rivalry, markets \nchange quickly and often, and entry barriers are low. In these environments, firms find it difficult \nto maintain a competitive advantage.13 Rivalry in hypercompetitive environments tends to occur \namong global competitors who innovate regularly and successfully.14 It is a condition of rapidly \nescalating competition based on price-quality positioning, competition to create new know-how \nand establish first-mover advantage, and competition to protect or invade established product \nand/or geographic markets. In a hypercompetitive market, firms often challenge their competitors \naggressively to strengthen their market position and ultimately, their performance.15 The fast-food \nindustry and ecommerce are examples of hypercompetitive markets. However, many industries \nand markets have some of the characteristics associated with hypercompetition due to the emer-\ngence of a global economy, rapid technological changes, and the global push to make businesses \naccountable for societal outcomes.\nSeveral factors influence the nature of the current competitive landscape. \n1-2a The Global Economy\nA global economy is one in which goods, services, people, skills, and ideas move with limited bar-\nriers across geographic borders. Although artificial constraints, such as tariffs, may have a limited \nimpact, the relatively free exchanges that occur in the global economy significantly expand and \ncomplicate a firm’s competitive environment.16 Firms must study the global economy carefully as a \nfoundation for learning how to position themselves to be competitive. \nAn understanding of the size of the economies in which a firm participates is important when \nstudying the global environment. In 2021 for example, the United States was the world’s largest \neconomy at an estimated value of approximately $23 trillion. At that time, China was the world’s \nsecond-largest economy with a value of nearly $17 trillion, while Japan was the third largest at a \nlittle over $5 trillion. Following Japan were Germany, the United Kingdom, India, and France.17 \nThus, companies scanning the global economy for opportunities might conclude that markets in \nthe United States, China, and Japan yield potentially significant opportunities for them. \nOf course, such an analysis also must consider entry barriers to various economies in the form \nof tariffs. A tariff is a tax imposed by a government on goods imported into their country. It is one \nof the evidences of what is called protectionism, which involves actions taken by a government to \nprotect its economy from adverse influences due to foreign trade.18 Sometimes tariffs are used as \nLearning Objective\n1-2 Describe the \ncompetitive landscape \nand explain how \nglobalization, \ntechnological changes, \nand expectations of \nsocially responsible \nbehavior shape it.\nHypercompetition is a \ncondition where competitors \nengage in intense rivalry, \nmarkets change quickly and \noften, and entry barriers are \nlow.\nA global economy is one \nin which goods, services, \npeople, skills, and ideas move \nwith limited barriers across \ngeographic borders.\nProtectionism involves \nactions taken by a government \nto protect its economy from \nadverse influences due to \nforeign trade.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In \n2021, India, Saudi Arabia, and France grew at a faster pace than most countries, which presented \nopportunities for firms entering those countries.21 Emerging economies like India tend to grow \nfaster than developed economies because of an increase in citizens that have disposable income \n(income that can be spent on things beyond absolute necessities). Important emerging economies \ninclude the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China)22 as well as a few other countries that \nhave been identified as having high growth potential; namely, Vietnam, Indonesia, South Africa, \nTurkey, Argentina, Colombia, and Egypt.23\nGlobalization\nGlobalization is the increasing economic interdependence among countries and their organizations \nas reflected in the flow of products, financial capital, and knowledge across country borders.24 It is a \nproduct of a large number of firms competing against one another in an increasing number of global \neconomies. In globalized markets and industries, firms might obtain financial capital in one national \nmarket and use it to buy raw materials in another. Firms might then use manufacturing equipment \npurchased in a third national market to produce and deliver products that it sells in a fourth market. \nThis phenomenon is described as a global supply chain. A global supply chain is a network of firms \nthat spans multiple countries with the purpose of supplying goods and services.25 Because firms seek \nout the best and most inexpensive supplies and products regardless of where in the world they are \nfound, practically every industry participates in a global supply chain, at least to some extent.\nOverall, globalization has led to higher performance standards with respect to multiple compet-\nitive dimensions, including quality, cost, productivity, product introduction time, and operational \nefficiency. Firms must learn how to deal with the reality that in today’s competitive landscape, only \ncompanies capable of meeting, if not exceeding, global standards typically earn above-average returns.\nAlthough globalization offers potential benefits to firms, it is not without challenges. One manage-\nment challenge comes from workers flowing rather freely among global economies. This is important \nbecause employees are a key source of competitive advantage.26 For example, Argentina currently has \ngreat difficulty keeping highly skilled tech workers in the country because they are being lured away \nby companies in the United States and Europe offering them significant pay increases.27 \nAnother challenge comes from a liability of foreignness, a term that describes the risks of com-\npeting outside a firm’s domestic markets.28 The amount of time firms usually require to learn to \ncompete in markets that are new to them is one risk of entering a global market. A firm’s perfor-\nmance can suffer until it gains the knowledge needed to compete successfully in a new global mar-\nket.29 This is especially true because of cultural differences that are likely to exist between the firm’s \nhome market and international markets. In addition, a firm’s performance may suffer by entering \ntoo many global markets either simultaneously or too quickly. When this happens, the overall orga-\nnization may lack the skills required to effectively manage all of its diversified global operations.30 \nThe Strategic Focus demonstrates that global interconnectedness associated with global supply \nchains also creates problems that would not exist if firms only relied on domestic markets for their \nproductive inputs.\nRelated to global supply chains are global value chains. Whereas a global supply chain pertains \nsimply to the transfer of goods from one party to another across a global network, a global value \nchain refers to the processes through which a firm receives raw materials, uses them to add value \nthrough manufacturing a product that provides greater utility for the consumer, and sells the prod-\nuct to another firm or the ultimate consumer of the product, in a global setting.31 In other words, a \nglobal supply chain pertains to an industry, whereas a global value chain pertains to an individual \nfirm as it seeks to create value, in part, through its management of a global supply chain. It is a set of \ninterrelated activities that involve companies from multiple countries, coordinated by a particular \nfirm in search of a competitive advantage. \nOn the surface, a global supply chain and a global value chain may appear the same. The global \nsupply chain describes the steps in production from raw materials to ultimate consumer; however, \nGlobalization is the \nincreasing economic \ninterdependence among \ncountries and their \norganizations as reflected in \nthe flow of products, financial \ncapital, and knowledge across \ncountry borders.\nA global supply chain is a \nnetwork of firms that spans \nmultiple countries with the \npurpose of supplying goods \nand services.\nA global value chain \nrefers to the processes \nthrough which a firm \nreceives raw materials, uses \nthem to add value through \nmanufacturing a product that \nprovides greater utility for \nthe consumer, and sells the \nproduct to another firm or \nthe ultimate consumer of the \nproduct, in a global setting.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

They help \ncompanies obtain the very best resources found anywhere in the \nworld, and at the best prices. However, they are not without prob-\nlems, in part due to their impact on the increased complexity and \nuncertainty that firms face. Also, participants in global supply chains \ncomplain that they do not have full visibility into their supply chains, \nand many supply chains are plagued by a lack of trust among partici-\npants. In addition, some consumers are resistant to globalization, and \nare reluctant to buy products that are produced largely outside their \nhome countries.\nHowever, one of the biggest problems associated with global sup-\nply chains occurs when there is a major shock in one or more parts \nof the chain. An unexpected event such as a hurricane or earthquake \ncan stop production of components that are necessary to produce \nproducts in other countries. One famous example is Toyota, which \nhad to close most of its Japan-based production plants due to supply \nchain disruptions after an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The short-\nage of parts lasted for weeks. Toyota put into place several measures \nto protect the company from problems in case of a similar event. \nHowever, in 2016, a series of earthquakes led to closing down almost \nall production lines in Japan due to supply shortages. Toyota is a \nvery successful company with highly sophisticated technologies; this \nexample demonstrates how hard it is to mitigate the risks associated \nwith shocks to the global supply chain.\nOf course, the COVID-19 pandemic was a shock to the entire global \neconomy and affected virtually every global supply chain. Labor and \nmaterials shortages were very harmful to production around the \nworld. Researchers found that the COVID-related disruption to supply \nchains due to production capacity damage in China had their biggest \nimpact on the United States, South Korea, Japan, and Germany, and \nespecially in the electronics, textiles, machinery, manufacturing, and \nwholesale trade sectors. However, this is largely because consumers \nin those countries purchase more non-essential items than consum-\ners in developing economies. Researchers also found that economies \nthat were hurt the worst by supply chain disruptions as a result of \nCOVID-19 were in developing nations—those that could least afford \nsuch difficulties.\nA military conflict such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is another \ntype of unexpected event that influences global supply chains. In \nthe run-up to the invasion, oil futures increased because Russia is a \nlarge provider of oil. Russia is also the major supplier of natural gas in \nEurope. Higher energy prices mean higher transportation and manu-\nfacturing costs, which increase inflation. Also, Western governments \nimposed strong sanctions against Russia that reduced the country’s \nability to conduct business in international markets.\nOverall, the increased efficiency and broader availability of \ngoods and services make global supply chains an attractive part of \nthe global economy. However, they also provide additional uncer-\ntainty that makes strategic management difficult because almost \nall businesses rely on them to some extent for the resources they \nneed.\nSources: Y.

Firms seek competitiveness in both domestic and \ninternational markets, in part, by remaining in tune with technological opportunities and potential \ndisruptions innovations might create.\n1-2b Technology and Technological Changes\nIncreasingly, technology affects all aspects of how companies operate and as such, the strategies \nthey choose to implement. Boston Consulting Group analysts describe technology’s impact as \nfollows: “No company can afford to ignore the impact of technology on everything from supply \nchains to customer engagement, and the advent of even more advanced technologies, such as \nartificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things, portends more far-reaching change.”37 \nInformation technologies facilitate the integration of enterprises into the global supply chains \ndescribed previously.38\nThe rate of technology diffusion, which is the speed at which new technologies become available \nto firms and when firms choose to adopt them, is far greater than was the case a decade or two ago. \nConsider the following rates of technology diffusion:\nIt took the telephone 35 years to get into 25 percent of all homes in the United States. It took TV  \n26 years. It took radio 22 years. It took PCs 16 years. It took the Internet 7 years.39\nThe impact of technological changes on individual firms and industries is broad and signif-\nicant. For example, information technologies have made working at home much more efficient \nand effective than it was a few years ago, and the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend.40 \nCompanies that facilitate at-home work—like Zoom and Microsoft—enjoyed tremendous success, \nand competitors are trying to catch up.41 In transportation, electric cars are rapidly increasing in \npopularity and automobile manufacturers are responding, which means that internal combustion \nengines are being pushed out of the automotive market.42 Also, innovative firms are working on \nself-driving cars and air taxis, small, pilotless aircraft designed to carry passengers short distances \nin and around cities.43 In addition, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are influencing international com-\nmerce as well as the investment community.44 Some believe that the public blockchains that make \ncryptocurrencies possible hold the potential to build a new decentralized digital economy.45\nRelated to many other technologies is AI, which has already had a significant impact in many \nareas.46 AI can be thought of as intelligence that is demonstrated by a machine. For example, a \nmachine exhibiting AI will use sensors to perceive and effectors to respond to its environment.47 \nIn the not-too-distant future, AI holds the potential to alter the human experience through new \ntechnologies, products, and services, as well as the way people work, communicate, and manage \nbusinesses.48 The famous theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking once said, “The rise of powerful AI \nwill be either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity. We do not yet know which.”49\nPerpetual innovation is a term used to describe how rapidly and consistently new, information- \nintensive technologies replace older ones. The shorter product life cycles resulting from rapid \ndiffusions of new technologies place a competitive premium on being able to quickly introduce \nnew, innovative products into the marketplace.50 For example, in 2021, Boston Consulting Group \nidentified the 50 most innovative companies in the world. The first five firms on this list are large \ncompanies—Apple, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla.51 During the research con-\nducted by Boston Consulting Group in support of the ranking, the company made some interesting \ndiscoveries that reinforce the value of innovation in today’s businesses. The 1,500 global innovation \nexecutives they surveyed found that the COVID-19 experience increased the importance of inno-\nvation in their companies. Also, more than 60 percent of companies plan to increase investments \nin innovative activities in an effort to keep up with technological changes.\nAnother indicator of rapid technology diffusion is that firms quickly gather information about \ntheir competitors’ research and development (R&D) and product decisions, sometimes even within \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In this sense, the rate of technological diffusion has reduced the competitive benefits \nof patents.54 Today, patents may still be an effective way of protecting proprietary technology in \na small number of industries such as pharmaceuticals. In contrast, many firms competing in the \nelectronics industry often do not apply for patents to prevent competitors from gaining access to \nthe technological knowledge included in the patent application.\nDisruptive technologies—technologies that destroy the value of an existing technology and \ncreate new markets—surface frequently in today’s competitive markets. 55 Think of the new mar-\nkets that have been created by the technologies underlying the development of products such as  \nWiFi, the web browser, smartphones, and electric cars. These types of products represent radical or \nbreakthrough innovations (we discuss radical innovations in Chapter 13).56 A disruptive or radical \ntechnology can create what is essentially a new industry or can harm industry incumbents. \nInformation Technology and Big Data\nKnowledge (information, intelligence, and expertise) is the basis of technology and its application. \nToday, knowledge is a critical organizational resource and an increasingly valuable source of com-\npetitive advantage.57 Individuals acquire knowledge through experience, observation, and inference. \nKnowledge is an intangible resource (we describe tangible and intangible resources fully in Chapter 3). \nThe value of firms’ intangible resources, including knowledge, continues increasing as a proportion of \ntotal shareholder value.58 Knowledge is a key intangible asset that, when diffused quickly throughout \na firm, contributes to efforts to outperform rivals.59 Therefore, firms must develop (e.g., through train-\ning programs) and acquire (e.g., by hiring educated and experienced employees) knowledge, integrate \nit into the organization to create capabilities, and then apply it to gain a competitive advantage.60\nInformation technology is key to acquiring and managing knowledge flows. Firms have begun \napplying “big data” technologies to help with these processes.61 Big data refers to the data retrieved \nby firms that are increasing in volume, variety, and frequency. Big data analytics is the process \nof examining huge amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns and other information that can \nbe used to improve decision making. The internet increased low-cost data storage capacity and \nincreased efficient processing technologies have made capturing and processing large volumes of \ndata possible. In fact, “cloud” technologies that link computer servers through the internet mean \nthat many of these processes can be performed offsite rather than on local computers. Amazon \nWeb Services provides big data solutions to other companies. They provide descriptive analytics, \nwhich answer the “What happened and why?” questions, as well as predictive analytics, and pre-\nscriptive analytics, which provides recommendations regarding what a client firm should do.62\nBig data analytics combined with internal systems that help information get to parts of the \norganization where it is most useful can enhance a firm’s strategic flexibility, a set of capabilities \nfirms use to respond to various demands and opportunities existing in today’s dynamic and uncer-\ntain competitive environment. Strategic flexibility involves coping with uncertainty and its accom-\npanying risks.63 Firms should try to develop strategic flexibility in all areas of their operations.\nTo be strategically flexible on a continuing basis and to gain the competitive benefits of such \nflexibility, a firm must also develop the capacity to learn. Continuous learning provides the firm \nwith new and up-to-date skill sets, which allow it to adapt to its environment as it encounters \nchanges.64 Firms capable of applying quickly what they have learned exhibit the strategic flexibility \nand the capacity to change in ways that will increase the probability of dealing successfully with \nuncertain, or even hypercompetitive, environments.\n1-2c \nSocial Responsibility\nToday’s competitive environment is also marked by the need to incorporate social responsibility \ninto a firm’s strategic management, often called corporate social responsibility, or CSR.65 More than \never before, society is holding corporations and other businesses, both large and small, accountable \nfor their actions with regard to a number of societal expectations, including how they treat employ-\nees, their records with regard to inclusiveness, the quality and safety of the products they make and \nservices they provide, their environmental records, the absence or existence of legal suits brought \nby any of their stakeholders, and their philanthropic activities.66\nStrategic flexibility is \na set of capabilities firms \nuse to respond to various \ndemands and opportunities \nexisting in today’s dynamic \nand uncertain competitive \nenvironment.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The basic idea behind \nsustainability is that a firm should not deplete or destroy natural elements upon which it depends \nfor survival.67 For example, if a forestry company cuts down a tree to create paper pulp, it should \nplant at least one tree that it can cut down in the future. Sustainability has also been extended \ninto other resource areas beyond the environment, such as human capital, gender equality, global \npoverty, and innovation. For instance, a firm that develops programs to recruit and train employ-\nees that live in poverty is promoting sustainability because these activities will provide important \nhuman resources used to produce products and services over the long term.\nThe corporate social responsibility movement extends beyond a firm’s own activities. Often \nlarge firms are also held accountable for the actions of the firms with which they do business.68 \nOne of the most significant manifestations of this phenomenon is the criticism a large cor-\nporation receives when it outsources some of its production to firms in other countries that \nengage in labor practices such as employing minor children or paying meager wages to over-\nworked employees with poor working conditions (sometimes called sweatshops).69 Apple has \nbeen highly criticized for many years for its inability to completely resolve problems like these \nin its supply chain.70\nAs society embraced the principles underlying CSR, CSP (corporate social performance), and \nsustainability, so did investors, especially institutional investors.71 Many of them want to invest in \nfirms that are socially responsible. One of the economic reasons for such investments is that firms \nthat are high in social responsibility are at less risk of legal suits, negative social media, walkouts, \nand so forth.72 In addition, research evidence is supportive of a small but positive relationship \nbetween corporate social responsibility and economic performance.73\nAs a result of increasing interest in the social responsibility of businesses, many firms have \nemerged to track this sort of information, most often referred to with the title of ESG (environment, \nsociety, and governance). Also, the majority of large corporations publish sustainability reports which \noutline their activities in these areas. Unfortunately, some of those reports exaggerate the activities of \nthe firm in areas such as protecting the environment, a phenomenon referred to as greenwashing.74 \nThere are organizations that hold businesses to a set of standards when reporting on sustainability, \nsuch as the ISO 14000 standards and the Global Reporting Initiative. However, there is not one set of \nstandards that is universally accepted, and typically firms are not required to participate.75\nWe have now discussed the almost overwhelmingly complex global competitive environment \nthat managers face when devising strategies. Fortunately, there are some well-developed models \nand tools to help managers with these sorts of decisions. In the next three sections, we will examine \nthree different models that managers can use to help their firms to achieve strategic competitive-\nness and above-average returns.\n1-3 The I/O Model of Above-Average Returns\nFrom the 1960s through the 1980s, those leading organizations believed that the external environ-\nment rather than the internal organization was the strongest influence on the choice of strategy.76 \nThe industrial organization (I/O) model of above-average returns explains the external environ-\nment’s dominant influence on the choice of strategy and the actions associated with it. The logic \nof the I/O model is that a set of industry characteristics, including economies of scale, barriers to \nmarket entry, diversification, product differentiation, the degree of concentration of firms in the \nindustry, and market frictions, determine the profitability potential of an industry or a segment \nof it as well as the actions firms should take to operate profitably.77 We examine these industry \ncharacteristics and explain their influence in Chapter 2.\nGrounded in economics, four underlying assumptions explain the I/O model. First, the \nmodel assumes that the external environment imposes pressures and constraints that deter-\nmine the strategies that result in above-average returns. Second, most firms competing within \nan industry or within a segment of that industry are assumed to control similar strategically \nrelevant resources and to pursue similar strategies in light of those resources. Third, resources \nare highly mobile, meaning that any resource differences that might develop between firms \nwill be short-lived. Fourth, the model assumes that organizational decision makers are rational \nindividuals who are committed to acting in the firm’s best interests, as shown by their profit- \nmaximizing behaviors.78 \nSustainability means that \na firm should not deplete \nor destroy natural elements \nupon which it depends for \nsurvival.\nLearning Objective\n1-3 Use the industrial \norganization (I/O) model \nto explain how firms \ncan earn above-average \nreturns.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This means that a firm is able to increase its per-\nformance only when it competes in the industry with the highest profit potential and learns how to \nuse its resources to implement the strategy required by the industry’s structural characteristics. The \ncompetitive realities associated with the I/O model find firms imitating each other’s strategies and \nactions taken to implement them.79\nThe five forces model of competition is an analytical tool firms use to find the industry that is \nthe most attractive for them. The model (explained in Chapter 2) tries to capture the complexity \nof competition by suggesting that an industry’s profitability is a function of interactions among \nfive forces: suppliers, buyers, competitive rivalry among firms currently in the industry, product \nsubstitutes, and potential entrants to the industry.80 Firms use the five forces model to identify the \nattractiveness of an industry (as measured by its profitability potential) as well as the most advanta-\ngeous position for the firm to take in that industry, given the industry’s characteristics.81 The model \nsuggests that firms can earn above-average returns by producing either standardized products at \ncosts below those of competitors (a cost leadership strategy) or by producing differentiated prod-\nucts for which customers are willing to pay a price premium (a differentiation strategy). We discuss \nthe cost leadership and product differentiation strategies fully in Chapter 4. \nAs shown in Figure 1.2, the I/O model suggests that firms earn above-average returns by study-\ning the external environment effectively as the foundation for identifying an attractive industry \nand implementing an appropriate strategy in it. For example, in some industries, firms can reduce \n1. Study the external\n     environment, especially\n     the industry environment.\n2.

However, research also shows that the firm’s resources and \ncapabilities and the actions taken by using them accounts for 36 percent of the variance in firm prof-\nitability.84 Thus, managers’ strategic actions affect the firm’s performance as do the characteristics of \nthe environment in which the firm competes.85 These findings suggest that the external environment \nand a firm’s resources, capabilities, core competencies, and competitive advantages (see Chapter 3) \ninfluence the company’s ability to achieve strategic competitiveness and earn above-average returns.\nAs shown in Figure 1.2, the I/O model assumes that a firm’s strategy is a set of commitments \nand actions flowing from the characteristics of the industry in which the firm chose to compete. \nThe resource-based model, discussed next, takes a different view of the major influences on a firm’s \nchoice of strategy.\n1-4 The Resource-Based Model \nof Above-Average Returns\nThe resource-based model of above-average returns assumes that each organization is a collection \nof unique resources and capabilities. The uniqueness of resources and capabilities is the basis of a \nfirm’s strategy and its ability to earn above-average returns.86 Resources are inputs into a firm’s pro-\nduction process, such as capital equipment, the skills of individual employees, patents, finances, and \ntalented managers. Firms use three categories to classify their resources: physical, human, and orga-\nnizational capital. Described fully in Chapter 3, resources are either tangible or intangible in nature.\nIndividual resources alone may not yield a competitive advantage; resources have a greater  \nlikelihood of being a source of competitive advantage when integrated to form a capability.  \nA capability is the capacity for a set of resources to perform a task or an activity in an integrative \nmanner.87 Core competencies are capabilities that serve as a source of competitive advantage for a \nfirm over its rivals.88 Core competencies are often visible in the form of organizational functions. \nFor example, Apple’s R&D function is one of its core competencies, as is its ability to produce \ninnovative new products that create value for customers. Amazon’s distribution function is a core \ncompetence while information technology is a core competence for Walmart.\nAccording to the resource-based model, differences in firms’ performances across time are due \nprimarily to their unique resources and capabilities rather than the industry’s structural charac-\nteristics. Through continued use, capabilities become stronger and more difficult for competitors \nto understand and imitate. As a source of competitive advantage, a capability must not be easily  \nimitated but also not too complex to understand and manage.89 The resource-based model of \nabove-average returns is found in Figure 1.3. This model suggests that the strategy the firm chooses \nshould allow it to use its competitive advantages in an attractive industry (firms use the I/O model \nto identify an attractive industry).\nNot all of a firm’s resources and capabilities have the potential to be the foundation for a com-\npetitive advantage. This potential is realized when resources and capabilities are valuable, rare, \ncostly to imitate, and non-substitutable.90 Resources and capabilities are valuable when they allow \na firm to take advantage of opportunities or neutralize threats in its external environment. They \nare rare when possessed by few, if any, current and potential competitors. Resources are costly to \nimitate when other firms either cannot obtain them or are at a cost disadvantage in obtaining them \ncompared with a firm that already possesses them. They are non-substitutable when they have no \npractical equivalents. \nOver time, competitors find ways to imitate value-creating resources or to create new resources that \nyield a different type of value for customers. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve and sustain a competi-\ntive advantage based on resources alone. Firms integrate individual resources to develop configurations \nof resources with the potential to build capabilities. Capabilities developed in this manner have a stron-\nger likelihood of becoming a core competence and of leading to a source of competitive advantage.91\nLearning Objective\n1-4 Use the resource-\nbased model to explain \nhow firms can earn \nabove-average returns.\nResources are inputs into \na firm’s production process, \nsuch as capital equipment, \nthe skills of individual \nemployees, patents, finances, \nand talented managers.\nA capability is the capacity \nfor a set of resources to \nperform a task or an activity in \nan integrative manner.\nCore competencies are \ncapabilities that serve as \na source of competitive \nadvantage for a firm over its \nrivals.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Since all firm resources come from stakeholders, it makes sense that the \nnature of relationships with those stakeholders will make a big difference in terms of a firm’s ability \nto create and sustain competitive advantages leading to above-average returns. In fact, one of the \nleading scholars on the resource-based model, Jay Barney, said that if there were no other stake-\nholders besides shareholders providing resources to the firm that have the potential to earn profits, \nthere would be no profits.92\n1-5 The Stakeholder Model \nof Above-Average Returns\nEvery organization involves a system of stakeholder groups with which it establishes and manages \nrelationships.93 Stakeholders are individuals, groups, and organizations that can both influence \nand are affected by the objectives, actions, and outcomes of a firm. They are internal and exter-\nnal constituencies that have a strong interest in the activities and outcomes of an organization \nand upon whom the organization relies on to achieve its own objectives.94 Internal stakehold-\ners include all of a firm’s employees, including both non-managerial and managerial personnel. \nExternal stakeholders are a diverse group, and include the major suppliers of a firm’s capital as  \nLearning Objective\n1-5 Use the stakeholder \nmodel to explain how \nfirms can earn above-\naverage returns.\nStakeholders are \nindividuals, groups, and \norganizations that can both \ninfluence and are affected by \nthe objectives, actions, and \noutcomes of a firm.\n1.

Also included are regulators and special interest groups or \nNGOs (non-governmental organizations) that play a role in policing what the firm does.\nHow can a firm’s managers account for all of these different interests when devising competitive \nstrategies? A related question is whether all of these stakeholders are, or should be, equally import-\nant when devising strategies to create value and achieve above-average returns. A useful classifica-\ntion between primary and secondary stakeholders helps managers answer both of these questions. \nPrimary stakeholders are directly involved in the value-creating processes of the firm. They include \nsuppliers, employees, customers, the communities in which the firm operates, and financiers such as \nthe firm’s shareholders and banks. In fact, nearly two hundred CEOs from the largest corporations in \nthe United States released a signed statement through an association called the Business Roundtable \ndeclaring that the purpose of the corporation is to serve these same five stakeholder groups.95\nSecondary stakeholders can both influence and are influenced by what the firm does, but \nthey do not contribute directly to the value the firm creates. Many successful organizations have \nlearned that taking especially good care of primary stakeholders can lead to competitive advantage \nand high performance.96 Some of the sources of competitive advantage, and the value they create, \nare outlined in Figure 1.4. This sort of management is often called managing for stakeholders or \nstakeholder-oriented management.\nPrimary stakeholders are \ndirectly involved in the value-\ncreating processes of the firm.\nSecondary stakeholders \ncan both influence and \nare influenced by what the \nfirm does, but they do not \ncontribute directly to the \nvalue the firm creates.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nReciprocity\n•  Stakeholders want to engage with the\n   firm, are loyal, help the firm achieve its \n   objectives, and are willing to share \n   valuable information\nInformation Useful for Strategic Planning\n•  Stakeholder needs and wants\n•  Ideas for improvements to value creation\n   process\n•  Ideas for product innovation\nStrategy Formulation\n•  Opportunities to collaborate\n•  Innovative products\n•  Enhanced efficiency\nStrategy Implementation\n•  Stakeholder needs and wants\n•  Ideas for improvements to value creation\n   process\n•  Potential areas for innovation\nSuperior Returns\n•  Earning of above-average returns\nStakeholders\n•  Have a legitimate interest (stake) in what\n   the firm does\n•  Firm depends on them to achieve its\n   objectives\nStudy external environment to\ndetermine which stakeholders\nare most important to value\ncreating processes.\nDevelop relationships with\nemployees and external\nstakeholders based on\nfairness, respect, and trust.\nCollect valuable information\nfrom stakeholders.\nIdentify strategies that\nincorporate information\nfrom stakeholders.\nDevelop and carry out plans\nusing collaborations with\nstakeholders where possible.\nFigure 1.4 The Stakeholder Model of Above-Average Returns\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Managing for stakeholders is economically feasible \nbecause it leads to behavior on the part of stakeholders that helps the firm create more value than \nmight otherwise be created.98 \nWell-treated stakeholders reciprocate by treating the firm and its other stakeholders well in \nreturn. One of the fundamental drivers of reciprocity is fairness, or what scholars call organizational \njustice.99 Organizational justice can be divided into three primary types: distributional, procedural, \nand interactional. Distributional justice means that stakeholders feel as though they are receiving \nvalue through their relationship with their firm that is commensurate with what they contribute \nto the firm. For example, an employee who works really hard and provides a lot of good sugges-\ntions for firm innovations feels as though they are compensated fairly for the additional value they \nprovide. Procedural justice means that the firm listens to stakeholders and considers their posi-\ntions when making important decisions that are likely to affect them. This does not mean that the \nfirm will always make decisions that have no negative impact on any stakeholder, although this is \na worthwhile objective. Interactional justice means that all stakeholders are treated with honesty, \nrespect, and integrity. Formal and informal (i.e., promises) contracts are made and kept. Day-to-\nday transactions with stakeholders typically are positive, and if something goes wrong, the firm \ndoes its best to remedy the situation.100\nStakeholders that experience this kind of fairness are likely to reciprocate through a higher level \nof motivation to work with the firm and provide a level of effort and loyalty that they might not \nprovide to another firm in the same industry. Because these sorts of firms tend to develop strong \nreputations for fairness, new stakeholders will want to be affiliated with them. Communities will \nwelcome expansions, job applications will be higher, and customers will want to buy from and \nremain loyal to the firm. Suppliers will want to sell to the firm, which means the firm will have \nmore attractive buying propositions and an opportunity to acquire superior resources and develop \nhighly competitive capabilities. In general, stakeholders will be more cooperative with the firm and \nwith each other in value-creating activities.101\nOrganizational justice also leads to higher levels of stakeholder trust, and this means stakehold-\ners will be much more likely to share important information with them. Taking advantage of this \nsort of trust, companies like Honda and Harley Davidson send out very long surveys to purchasers \nof their automobiles and motorcycles. The information gathered is tremendously helpful in devel-\noping next-generation products, and it would not be made available if customers did not trust that \nthe information they provide would be given attention—that the companies would listen to them. \nTrust associated with organizational justice is an important source of competitive advantage. In a \nrecent survey, a group reported that “Unlike other online retailers, 67 percent of Amazon custom-\ners trust the company to protect their privacy and personal data.”102\nConsider also the advantages from generating feelings of trust among employees. They will \nbe much more likely to share information with management about how to improve products or \nservices, or to improve the efficiency with which they are made and delivered. Also, suppliers who \ntrust a firm will be more willing to invest resources in developing new components for sale to the \nfirm and are also more likely to share information with them that could improve their products and \nproduction processes because they believe that the information will not be used opportunistically \nagainst them.\nThese factors can lead to higher levels of innovation, sales growth, and operational efficiency. \nThe contracting process is also more efficient, because high levels of trust mean that contracts will \nnot need to contain as many safeguards or complicated contingency clauses.103 In addition, because \nstakeholders are treated well and promises to them are kept, they are much less likely to pursue \nnegative actions such as boycotts, legal suits, walkouts and strikes, lobbying for new regulations, \nor negative social media activities. This means that a firm that emphasizes organizational justice is \na less risky proposition for all of the firm’s stakeholders, including those that invest time, material \nresources, energy, or money in the firm. Also, an enhanced reputation means that potential new \nstakeholders, such as new customers, new suppliers, and new employees with excellent qualifica-\ntions, will be attracted to the firm. This can give the firm an edge as it competes with other firms \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

Fortunately, research evi-\ndence supports the view that firms that manage for stakeholders often enjoy above-average returns \ncompared to firms that do not manage for stakeholders.106 In addition, as discussed in the Strategic \nFocus, firms that manage for stakeholders tend also to perform well on related dimensions such as \nCSR, CSP, and ESG.\n1-5a Managing for Stakeholders\nAlthough research confirms a positive relationship between managing for stakeholders and \nfirm performance, not all firms that manage in this way will have above-average returns. This is \nbecause stakeholder management is only one important component in the strategic management \nprocess. The rest of this book outlines many other important components of devising strat-\negy. Also, situations may occur in which a firm would perform better if they simply engage in \nwhat are called arms-length transactions with stakeholders.107 This means that a firm doesn’t try \nCorporate Social Responsibility, Corporate Social Performance, and ESG\nStakeholder-oriented firms typically exhibit high performance \nin matters that are important to society, beyond just taking \ngood care of their stakeholders. This sort of performance might \nbe labeled CSR (corporate social responsibility), CSP (corporate \nsocial performance), or ESG (environment, society, and gover-\nnance. These labels are often used interchangeably, which can be  \nconfusing even to people who spend their lives studying such phe-\nnomena. Regardless of how they are labeled, corporate behaviors \nassociated with social responsibility are very important to many eco-\nnomic actors and a large swath of society. \nScholars who study social responsibility have argued among \nthemselves regarding whether CSR or CSP is a better descriptor of \nthe things a firm does that are either consistent with or go against \nsocietal values. However, these same scholars tend to measure the \nsame phenomena in their research, so the debate about terminology \nis strictly academic. Of course, the term sustainability, mentioned pre-\nviously in this chapter, has also been used in this literature. However, \nsustainability tends to focus more on environmental issues and a \nfew other issues, whereas CSR and CSP incorporate all areas that \nare scrutinized by society, which also includes how a firm treats its \nstakeholders.\nAnother common label in this literature is ESG. The data provided \nto the investment community by the firms who track and report \ninformation about social responsibility tends to be divided into three \ncategories. The first area is the environment (E), such as the amount \nof carbon that is released through a firm’s operations, the degree to \nwhich a firm pollutes in other ways, such as polluting groundwater, \nand the extent to which its operations destroy or deplete other nat-\nural resources such as trees or minerals. In the society (S) category, \nthese firms track a lot of information about how companies treat their \nstakeholders, their records on matters such as discrimination and \ninclusion, and whether they engage in “sin” industries such as tobacco \nor gambling. In the governance (G) area, the rating firms collect infor-\nmation about the firm’s board of directors, executive compensation, \nand reporting transparency. Corporate governance will be discussed \nin detail in Chapter 10. Over the years, the popular business press \nand many managers and investors have adopted the ESG label as a \ndescriptor for business activities associated with social responsibility \nor sustainability. \nThere is a lot of overlap among the various labels for social \nresponsibility primarily because they measure most of the same \nthings. However, managing for stakeholders is something different. \nThe way a firm manages its stakeholders—how it treats them—is \nonly one component of a measure of CSR, CSP, or ESG. The focus in \nthis section has been on the strategic advantages that can accrue \nto a firm that treats its stakeholders particularly well, and not on \nthese broader conceptualizations of corporate social responsibil-\nity. Although, again, firms that are high on the social responsibility  \ndimensions also tend to take good care of their stakeholders–\nrelated, but not the same thing.\nSources: S. Schaltegger, K. L.

This approach could \nbe more efficient when innovation, loyalty, and higher \nlevels of stakeholder motivation are not as important, \nbut it doesn’t mean the firm should treat stakehold-\ners poorly. Poor treatment of stakeholders is likely to \nlead to competitive problems over time as stakeholders \nchoose not to engage with the firm. \nAlso, the stakeholder model suggests that a firm \nshould treat stakeholders better than competing firms, \nbut does not suggest overzealousness that could lead to \n“giving away the store.” Managers need to be careful in \nallocating their time, attention, and the firm’s resources \nacross their stakeholders. One of the keys to managing \nfor stakeholders is determining how much is too much when it comes to allocations to stakehold-\ners. From an economic efficiency perspective, it is best to offer to each stakeholder a value prop-\nosition that is just noticeably better than what they would get if they engage in the same sort of \ntransactions with a competing firm.108 These sorts of value allocations to a stakeholder can unlock \nmany of the benefits from stakeholder-oriented management, such as loyalty or a higher level of \nmotivation to work with the firm to create additional value. Allocations beyond this level could \nlead to feelings among some stakeholders that a firm is showing favoritism, thus reducing the sense \nthat the firm is being fair. Or, over time, greatly disparate allocations could mean that the firm has \ninsufficient resources to invest in other important resource areas or stakeholders.\nAlthough organizations have dependency relationships with all their primary stakeholders, \nthey are not equally dependent on all stakeholders at all times. Unequal dependencies mean that \nstakeholders possess different degrees of ability to influence an organization.109 The more critical \nand valued is a stakeholder’s participation, the greater is a firm’s dependency on that stakeholder. \nGreater dependence, in turn, gives the stakeholder more potential influence over a firm’s commit-\nments, decisions, and actions. Managers must find ways to either accommodate or insulate the \norganization from the demands of stakeholders controlling critical resources.110\nThe I/O, resource-based, and stakeholder models all help firms devise competitive strategies. \nThey do not contradict each other, but rather view the organization through three different lenses. \nThey are also helping in determining a firm’s overall purpose, as reflected in vision, mission, and \nvalues, which are the topics of the next section. \n1-6 Vision, Mission, and Values\nAfter analyzing the external environment, the internal organization, and relationships with stake-\nholders, the firm has the information required to form its vision, mission, and values (see Figure 1.1). \nStakeholders learn a great deal about a firm by studying its vision, mission, and values. Indeed, a key \npurpose of these statements is to inform stakeholders of what the firm is, what it seeks to accomplish, \nand who it seeks to serve.\n1-6a Vision\nVision is a picture of what the firm wants to be and, in broad terms, what it wants to achieve.111 \nThus, a vision statement articulates the ideal description of an organization and gives shape to its \nintended future. In other words, a vision statement points the firm in the direction of where it \nwould like to be in the years to come. An effective vision stretches and challenges people as well. \nIn her book about Steve Jobs, Apple’s former CEO, Carmine Gallo, argues that Jobs’s vision for the \nfirm was a key reason for Apple’s innovativeness during his tenure. She suggests that he thought \nbigger and differently than do most people. To be innovative, she explains that one has to think \ndifferently about the firm’s products and customers, and create high expectations.112 \nAs a reflection of values and aspiration, firms hope that their vision statement will capture the \nheart and mind of each employee and, hopefully, other stakeholders as well. A firm’s vision tends to \nbe enduring while its mission can change with new environmental conditions. A vision statement \nLearning Objective\n1-6 Describe vision, \nmission, and values, and \nexplain why they are \nimportant. \nVision is a picture of what \nthe firm wants to be and, in \nbroad terms, what it wants to \nultimately achieve.\nGround Picture/Shutterstock.com\nManaging for stakeholders can enhance employee motivation  \nand loyalty\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Examples of vision state-\nments include the following:\nTo make this world a mobile, sustainable place with access to all the citizens. (Volkswagen)\nDrawing strength from our rich history, we will be the best, most admired, and innovative financial \nservices institution, partnering with our customers, employees, and shareholders in wealth and value \ncreation. (China Bank)\nTo be the communications leader in an increasingly connected world. (Vodaphone)\nAs a firm’s most important and prominent strategic leader, the CEO is responsible for working \nwith others to form the firm’s vision. Experience shows that the most effective vision statement \nresults when the CEO involves a host of stakeholders (e.g., other top-level managers, employees \nworking in different parts of the organization, suppliers, and customers) to develop it. Conditions \nin the firm’s external environment and internal organization influence the forming of a vision state-\nment. Moreover, the decisions and actions of those involved with developing the vision, especially \nthe CEO and the other top-level managers, must be consistent with it.\n1-6b Mission\nThe vision is the foundation for the firm’s mission. A mission specifies the businesses in which \nthe film intends to compete and the customers it intends to serve.113 The firm’s mission is more \nconcrete than its vision. However, similar to the vision, a mission should establish a firm’s indi-\nviduality and should be inspiring and relevant to all stakeholders. Together, the vision and mis-\nsion provide the foundation the firm needs to choose and implement one or more strategies. \nThe probability of forming an effective mission increases when employees have a strong sense of \nthe ethical standards that guide their behaviors as they work to help the firm reach its vision.114 \nThus, business ethics are a vital part of the firm’s discussions to decide what it wants to become \n(its vision) as well as who it intends to serve and how it desires to serve those individuals and \ngroups (its mission).115\nEven though the final responsibility for forming the firm’s mission rests with the CEO, the CEO \nand other top-level managers often involve other people to develop the mission statement. The \nmain reason for this is that the mission deals more directly with product markets and customers. \nCompared to a firm’s senior-level leaders, middle- and first-level managers and other employees \ninteract frequently with customers and the markets the firm serves. The mission of the American \nRed Cross is as follows:\nThe American Red Cross prevents and alleviates human suffering in the face of emergencies by mobi-\nlizing the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors.\nThis mission statement flows from the humanitarian purpose of the Red Cross, but it also pro-\nvides a clear statement of what it does, who it serves, and how it does it. Likewise, the International \nRed Cross Committee, an independent organization based in Geneva, Switzerland, has a staff of \n20,000 working in more than 100 countries. They also have a very specific mission that focuses \nprimarily on victims of conflict, but also extends into promoting political and social humanitarian \nlaw:\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross is an impartial, neutral and independent organization \nwhose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict \nand other situations of violence and to provide them with assistance. The ICRC also endeavours to \nprevent suffering by promoting and strengthening humanitarian law and universal humanitarian \nprinciples.\nGlobally, the symbol of a red cross is understood to be associated with humanitarian aid; how-\never, these two noble organizations have a very different mission within this general category of \ngiving aid to those in distress.\n1-6c \nValues\nThe values—sometimes called core values—of an organization define what should matter \nmost to managers and employees when they make and implement strategic decisions. They \nA mission specifies the \nbusinesses in which the firm \nintends to compete and the \ncustomers it intends to serve.\nThe values of an organization \ndefine what should matter \nmost to managers and \nemployees when they make \nand implement strategic \ndecisions.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

They are a practical \napplication of business ethics.116 For instance, if an organization puts a lot of value on treating \ncustomers with respect, then behavior that exhibits customer respect should be acknowledged \nand rewarded. \nValues can help a firm define its purpose and answer the fundamental question of what \nthe firm stands for. If they are well communicated and reinforced, they should help determine \nthe way stakeholders are treated and their priority in important decisions. Core values are \nsometime incorporated into a firm’s mission statement, but today more and more firms are \nputting them in separate statements to reinforce to stakeholders what they stand for. In a world  \nthat is ever more vigilant about business behaviors as they relate to social responsibility, this \nis a wise thing to do. However, firms also need to exhibit behaviors that are consistent with \ntheir values or these types of statements can backfire and cause considerable damage to their \nreputations.117\nMcDonald’s is arguably the most successful fast-food chain in the world. McDonald’s stated \nvalues are:\n\t\n●\nServe: We put our customers and people first\n\t\n●\nInclusion: We open our doors to everyone\n\t\n●\nIntegrity: We do the right thing\n\t\n●\nCommunity: We are good neighbors\n\t\n●\nFamily: We get better together118\nClearly, ineffectively developed vision, mission, and values statements fail to provide the direc-\ntion a firm needs to take appropriate strategic actions. This is undesirable in that, as shown in \nFigure 1.1, a firm’s vision, mission, and values are critical aspects of the analysis and the founda-\ntion required to engage in strategic actions that help to achieve strategic competitiveness and earn \nabove-average returns. Therefore, firms must accept the challenge of forming effective vision, mis-\nsion, and values statements.\n1-7 Strategic Leaders\nStrategic leaders are people located in different areas and levels of the firm using the strategic \nmanagement process to select actions that help the firm achieve its vision, fulfill its mission, and \nadhere to its values. Regardless of their location in the firm, successful strategic leaders are deci-\nsive, committed to nurturing those around them, and committed to helping the firm create value \nfor all stakeholder groups.119 \nWhen identifying strategic leaders, most of us tend to think of CEOs and other top-level man-\nagers. Clearly, these people are strategic leaders. In the final analysis, CEOs are responsible for \nmaking certain their firm uses the strategic management process successfully. However, many \nothers help choose a firm’s strategy and the actions to implement it.120 The reason for this is that \nthe realities of twenty-first-century competition mentioned earlier in this chapter (e.g., the global \neconomy, globalization, rapid technological change, emphasis on social responsibility) create a \nneed for those “closest to the action” to play a role in choosing and implementing the firm’s strat-\negy. In fact, all managers (as strategic leaders) must think globally and act locally.121 Thus, the \nmost effective CEOs and top-level managers understand how to delegate strategic responsibilities \nto people throughout the firm who influence the use of organizational resources.122\nStrategic leaders’ decisions and actions shape a firm’s culture. Organizational culture refers to \nthe complex set of ideologies, symbols, and core values that individuals throughout the firm share \nand that influence how the firm conducts business. Organizational culture is the social energy that \ndrives—or fails to drive—the organization.123 For example, many believe that the culture at South-\nwest Airlines is unique and valuable. Its culture encourages employees to work hard but also to \nhave fun while doing so. Moreover, its culture entails respect for others—employees and customers \nalike. The firm also places a premium on service, as suggested by its commitment to provide POS \n(Positively Outrageous Service) to each customer.\nThis is just a short introduction to strategic leadership and what strategic leaders do. Chapter 12  \nexplores these topics in depth.\nLearning Objective\n1-7 Describe strategic \nleaders and what they \ndo.\nStrategic leaders are people \nlocated in different areas \nand levels of the firm using \nthe strategic management \nprocess to select actions that \nhelp the firm achieve its vision, \nfulfill its mission, and adhere to \nits values.\nOrganizational culture \nrefers to the complex set \nof ideologies, symbols, and \ncore values that individuals \nthroughout the firm share \nand that influence how the \nfirm conducts business.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Figure 1.1 also features the topics \nwe examine in this book to present the strategic management process.\nWe divide this book into three parts—parts that align with the A-S-P process explained \nin the beginning of the chapter. In Part 1, we describe the analyses (A) firms use to develop \nstrategies. Specifically, we explain how firms analyze their external environment (Chapter 2) \nand internal organization (Chapter 3). Firms complete these analyses to identify marketplace \nopportunities and threats in the external environment (Chapter 2) and to decide how to use the \nresources, capabilities, core competencies, and competitive advantages in their internal organi-\nzation to pursue opportunities and overcome threats (Chapter 3). Firms use knowledge about \ntheir external environment and internal organization to formulate strategies in light of their \nvision, mission, and values.\nThe firm’s analyses (see Figure 1.1) provide inputs that are the foundation for choosing one  \nor more strategies (S) and deciding which one(s) to implement. As suggested in Figure 1.1 by the \nhorizontal arrow linking the two types of strategic actions, firms simultaneously integrate formu-\nlation and implementation as a basis for a successful strategic management process. Integration \noccurs as decision makers review implementation issues when choosing strategies and when con-\nsidering potential adaptations to a strategy during the implementation process.\nIn Part 2, we discuss the different strategies firms may choose to use. First, we examine business- \nlevel strategies (Chapter 4). A business-level strategy describes actions a firm takes to exploit its \ncompetitive advantage(s). A company competing in a single product market (e.g., a locally owned \ngrocery store operating in only one location) has but one business-level strategy, while a diversified \nfirm competing in multiple product markets (e.g., Siemens AG) forms a business-level strategy for \neach of its businesses. In Chapter 5, we describe the actions and reactions that occur among firms \nas they engage each other in competition. Competitors typically respond to and try to anticipate \neach other’s actions. The dynamics of competition affect the strategies firms choose as well as how \nthey intend to implement those strategies.124 \nDetermining the businesses in which the company intends to compete as well as how it will \nmanage those businesses is the focus of corporate-level strategy (Chapter 6). Companies com-\npeting in more than one business experience diversification in the form of products (Chapter 7) \nand/or geographic markets (Chapter 8). Other topics vital to strategy formulation, particularly in \nthe diversified company, include acquiring other businesses and, as appropriate, restructuring the \nfirm’s portfolio of businesses (Chapter 7) and selecting an international strategy (Chapter 8). With \ncooperative strategies (Chapter 9), firms form a partnership to share their resources and capabili-\nties to develop a competitive advantage. \nTo examine the actions firms take to implement strategies, we consider several topics in Part 3.  \nFirst, we examine the different mechanisms companies use to govern themselves (Chapter 10). \nWith different stakeholders (e.g., financial investors and board of directors’ members) demanding \nimproved corporate governance today, organizations seek to identify paths to follow to satisfy these \ndemands.125 In the last three chapters, we address the organizational structure and actions needed to \ncontrol a firm’s operations (Chapter 11), the patterns of strategic leadership appropriate for today’s \nfirms and competitive environments (Chapter 12), and strategic entrepreneurship (Chapter 13)  \nas a path to continuous innovation.\nAs you will discover, the strategic management process we present to you in this book calls for \ndisciplined approaches to serve as the foundation for developing a competitive advantage. There-\nfore, the process has a major effect on the performance (P) of the firm. Mastery of this strategic \nmanagement process contributes positively to a firm’s efforts to achieve strategic competitiveness \nand, in doing so, to create value for its stakeholders.\nLearning Objective\n1-8 Explain the strategic \nmanagement process.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Firms analyze the external environ-\nment and their internal organization, then formulate \nand implement a strategy to achieve a desired level of \nperformance (A-S-P). The firm’s level of strategic com-\npetitiveness and the extent to which it earns above- \naverage returns reflects its performance. Firms achieve \nstrategic competitiveness by developing and imple-\nmenting a value-creating strategy. Above-average \nreturns (in excess of what investors expect to earn \nfrom other investments with similar levels of risk) pro-\nvide the foundation for satisfying all of a firm’s stake-\nholders simultaneously.\n \n● The fundamental nature of competition is different in \nthe current competitive landscape. As a result, those \nmaking strategic decisions must adopt a different \nmind-set—one that allows them to learn how to com-\npete in highly turbulent and chaotic environments that \nproduce a great deal of uncertainty. The globalization \nof industries and their markets along with rapid and \nsignificant technological changes and an emphasis on \nsocial responsibility are primary factors contributing to \nthe turbulence of the competitive landscape.\n \n● Firms use three major models to help develop their \nvision, mission, and values, while choosing one or more \nstrategies to pursue strategic competitiveness and \nabove-average returns. The core assumption of the \nI/O model is that the firm’s external environment has a \nlarger influence on the choice of strategies than does \nits internal resources, capabilities, and core competen-\ncies. Thus, firms use the I/O model to understand the \neffects an industry’s characteristics can have on them \nwhen selecting a strategy or strategies to use to com-\npete against rivals. The logic supporting the I/O model \nsuggests that firms earn above-average returns by \nlocating an attractive industry or part of an attractive \nindustry and then successfully implementing the strat-\negy dictated by that industry’s characteristics.\n \n● The core assumption of the resource-based model is \nthat the firm’s unique resources, capabilities, and core \ncompetencies have more of an influence on selecting \nand using strategies than does the firm’s external envi-\nronment. When firms use their valuable, rare, costly- \nto-imitate, and non-substitutable resources and capabil-\nities effectively, when competing against rivals in one  \nor more industries, they earn above-average returns. \n \n● The stakeholder model focuses on the nature of relation-\nships between the firm and its stakeholders. Excellent \nrelationships based on principles associated with organi-\nzational justice (fairness) result in a high level of reciproc-\nity from stakeholders and a number of other positive \noutcomes that result in the firm creating more value for \nstakeholders, thus producing above-average returns.\n \n● The firm’s vision, mission, and values guide its selec-\ntion of strategies based on the information from anal-\nyses of its external environment; internal organization; \nand stakeholder needs, wants, and other valuable \ninformation they provide to the firm. Vision is a picture \nof what the firm wants to be and, in broad terms, what \nit wants to achieve ultimately. Flowing from the vision, \nthe mission specifies the business or businesses in \nwhich the firm intends to compete and the customers \nit intends to serve. Values pertain to the purpose of \nthe firm and how it will conduct business. Vision, mis-\nsion, and values provide direction to the firm and sig-\nnal important descriptive information to stakeholders.\n \n● Strategic leaders are people located in different areas \nand levels of the firm using the strategic management \nprocess to help the firm achieve its vision and fulfill its \nmission. In general, CEOs are responsible for making \ncertain that their firms use the strategic management \nprocess properly; however, the participation of strategic \nleaders in all parts of the organization is important. The \ndecisions and actions of strategic leaders help determine \nthe culture of the organization, which in turn influences \nthe effectiveness of the strategic management process. \nKey Terms\nabove-average returns 5\naverage returns 5\ncapability 14\ncompetitive advantage 4\ncore competencies 14\nglobal economy 7\nglobal supply chain 8\nglobal value chain 8\nglobalization 8\nhypercompetition 7\nmission 20\norganizational culture 21\nprimary stakeholders 16\nprotectionism 7\nresources 14\nrisk 5\nsecondary stakeholders 16\nstakeholders 15\nstrategic competitiveness 4\nstrategic flexibility 11\nstrategic leaders 21\nstrategic management process 5\nstrategy 4\nsustainability 12\nvalues 20\nvision 19\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

What are strategic competitiveness, strategy, competi-\ntive advantage, above-average returns, and the strate-\ngic management process?\n2. What are the characteristics of the current competitive \nlandscape? What factors are the primary drivers of this \nlandscape?\n3. According to the I/O model, what should a firm do to \nearn above-average returns?\n4. What does the resource-based model suggest a firm \nshould do to earn above-average returns?\n5. Based on the stakeholder model, what can a firm do to \nearn above-average returns?\n6. What are vision, mission, and values?\n7. How would you describe the work of strategic leaders?\n8. What are the elements of the strategic management \nprocess? How are they interrelated?\nMini-Case\nKipling Instruments Faces a Severe Economic and Ethical Dilemma\nSherry Ho is the CEO of Kipling Instruments, a 50-year-old  \ncompany that sells smoke detectors primarily to discount \nstores and hardware stores across the United States. The \ncompany also maintains a website through which the final \nconsumers of the products can buy directly from the com-\npany. However, this does not account for many of their \nsales. Kipling does not sell through online retailers such \nas Amazon because its primary customers (discount and \nhardware stores) have expressed the sentiment that doing  \nso would erode their own sales, and Kipling is very loyal to \nits customers.\nSmoke detectors are a part of the consumer electronics \nindustry and, like most firms in this industry, Kipling has \nbeen battered by foreign competitors that offer a similar \nproduct at a lower price. Kipling has stayed afloat because \nof its reputation for offering a reliable product and because \nof its long-term relationships with customers. However, \nprice differentials have eroded Kipling sales. In an effort to \nstay competitive, 20 years ago Kipling began subcontracting \nthe manufacturing of its products overseas. The company \nnow works with manufacturing companies in Vietnam and \nPoland, although the Vietnamese company fills most of the \norders. All of Kipling’s products are still designed in house, \nand they are carefully inspected and tested when they arrive \nat the warehouse to make sure they are of the highest quality \nand reliability.\nThe company operates out of a leased office and ware-\nhouse in a small town in a remote part of the midwestern \nUnited States, and has approximate sales of $50 million. \nSherry became CEO five years ago when the founder retired. \nPrior to the appointment, she was with the company for \nfive years as a sales manager and later as the administrative \nassistant for four years. She got the sales manager job imme-\ndiately upon graduation from University of Kansas with a \nB.S. in business. In addition to Sherry, Kipling’s 14 employees  \nall include an administrative assistant, four sales managers, \nan electrical engineer who designs and inspects the detec-\ntors, a purchasing agent, a warehouse supervisor, two ware-\nhouse employees, a driver, and two custodians, who also \nhandle most of the maintenance of the office and warehouse.  \nThe electrical engineer is highly skilled and has a master’s \ndegree in mechanical engineering as well as many years of \nexperience. The sales managers have been with the company \nfor a minimum of 10 years. The purchasing agent works part-\ntime for the company on an as-needed basis, and is fluent \nin English, Vietnamese, Thai, and also knows some Polish. \nThe rest of the employees do not have any special skills or \ntraining.\nKipling Instruments is incorporated. The founding family,  \na 72-year-old retired Polish immigrant and his 80-year-old \nwife (no children and no relatives in the United States), own \n60 percent of the stock. The other 40 percent is owned by \nemployees, who acquired the stock through an Employee \nStock Ownership Plan (ESOP) in which they receive  \n100 shares of stock for each year of service. The stock is not \ntraded on any exchange and the company has been paying a \n$10 per share dividend on it for the past 10 years. The found-\ning family now relies on these dividends as a primary source \nof income. For the past five years, the company has been pro-\nviding financial support to a local community organization \nthat provides meals in the homes of low-income older adults. \nThe company has a strong reputation for integrity and for \ntreating all of its employees well.\nThe work process is fairly simple. The sales managers have \ndivided the continental United States into four regions. They \ntravel around the country, making calls on the purchasing \nmanagers of discount stores and hardware stores throughout \ntheir regions. They not only make the initial sales calls, but \nthey follow up to make sure their customers are satisfied. In \nspite of this outstanding service, the company has not landed \na huge account such as Walmart, but it has several large \nregional chains on its customer list. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In these cases, if the customer is large enough, \nthe company engineer will design the product and send the \nspecifications to the purchasing agent, who then meets with \nmanufacturers in Vietnam or Poland to secure a contract. \nThe purchasing agent manages all contacts with suppliers \nand ensures that products are shipped on time and accord-\ning to specifications. When the smoke detectors arrive at the \nwarehouse, the engineer inspects them for quality. Some are \nput in inventory and some are shipped immediately to the \ncustomer. The warehouse employees manage the inventory \nand load the outgoing smoke detectors on a company vehicle. \nThe driver then delivers them to customers if they are within \na 100-mile radius, but most are delivered to third-party ship-\nping companies in a larger city about 50 miles away. The \nshipping companies then take responsibility for delivery to \ncustomers.\nAs mentioned previously, intense and growing compe-\ntition has created some serious financial problems for the \ncompany. Sales have remained stable because of excellent \ncustomer service and product quality, but competition has \nforced the company to reduce its prices, especially on the \nstandard products it sells (margins are still good on custom \nproducts). Overall, margins have eroded to the point that the \ncompany has been losing money in some years. Three years \nago, the company began to take on new debt in the form of \nbank loans to cover some of its operating costs. The local \nbank was willing to finance this rough spot because of its \nlong-term relationship with the company and a belief that \nSherry would figure things out. However, the bank is losing \npatience because things don’t seem to be improving, and \nrecently demanded a large payment on the company’s debt. \nUnfortunately, the company is currently having difficulty \npaying its employees and other expenses. \nIn the middle of this difficult situation, there was some \nhope. Three months ago, a large regional discount depart-\nment store chain called Way-to-Go placed a very large order \nfor some custom smoke detectors. They followed the same \ndesign as one of the basic detectors, but Way-to-Go wanted \nthem in a light brown color instead of white. This was easy \nto do, but because they were a custom order, the light brown \ndetectors also provided a higher margin. The engineer quickly \nsent the specifications to the purchasing agent, who secured \nthe contract with a manufacturer in Vietnam. The detectors \nwere shipped and had just arrived. If the detectors are sent out \nimmediately and Way-to-Go pays for the detectors within 30 \ndays or so after delivery, the large sale would provide enough \ncash to make the payment the bank was requiring, as well as \ncover other expenses for a few months.\nSherry was wondering if the new account could at least \nbuy the company some time while she figures out what to do. \nThen she heard a knock on the door. It was Izzy, the engineer. \nThere was a problem during the testing of the new smoke \ndetectors. They worked, but they worked at a level of smoke \ndetection that was too high to be safe. He immediately con-\ntacted the purchasing agent in Vietnam, who gave him more \nbad news. The company that manufactured the detectors had \nsome problems with other accounts, and they went out of \nbusiness shortly after the detectors were shipped. However, \nIzzy assured Sherry that there was no chance that Way-to-Go \nwould ever find out that the smoke detectors would not work \nthe way they are supposed to work.\nBesides the short-term question about whether to inform \nthe customer, Way-to-Go, about the smoke alarms, Sherry \nwas wondering about the possibility of reshoring (bringing \nback in house) at least some of their own manufacturing, \ngiven their problems with suppliers, the recent trend toward \nless globalization, supply constraints during the COVID-19 \npandemic, and other uncertainties associated with severe \npolitical conflicts on the horizon affecting trade between \ncountries. She was also wondering whether, in the longer \nterm, Kipling might use its connections and expertise to \ndiversify into other products, and whether it was time to \ndevelop a new approach to digital marketing.\nSource: This is a fictional company but reflects the competitive situation of \nmany small, medium-sized, or even some larger companies around the world.\nMini-Case Questions\n1. Is Kipling Instruments in an attractive industry? What \nare the factors that make the industry attractive or \nunattractive? Based on this analysis, do you think it is \neasy or difficult to earn above-average returns in this \nindustry?\n2. Describe the primary resources Kipling uses in its busi-\nness. Could any of these resources be considered core \ncompetencies leading to a competitive advantage \nover Kipling’s rivals in the industry? If they are, do  \nyou believe the competitive advantage is likely to be \nsustainable?\n3. If Sherry decides to tell Way-to-Go about the problem \nwith the smoke detectors, what will be the possible \nimpact on Kipling’s primary stakeholders (founder, \nemployees, community, bank, suppliers, customers)? \nOn balance, would a decision to tell Way-to-Go do \nmore harm or good?\n4. Assuming that Sherry decides to tell Way-to-Go about \nthe problem, what are some of the short-term actions \nSherry can take to try to rescue the company?\n5. From a strategic (longer-term) perspective, what \nshould Kipling consider doing to enhance perfor-\nmance and avoid this type of situation in the future?\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Miguel has a background in sales, having served in executive posi-\ntions at Avon Products Inc. and Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. The company hoped that  \nMr. Fernandez would be able to revitalize a company that has struggled at times \nto keep up with changes in its environment. Tupperware relies on an independent \nsales force to host parties and distribute the company’s plastic containers and  \nbeauty products. \nAlthough Tupperware’s signature plastic containers basically created the modern \nfood storage market, consumers now have many options for both food containers \nand beauty products. In this highly competitive environment, the company has been \nstruggling to find new sellers to reach consumers. In fact, when Mr. Fernandez took \nover, the number of people who were actively selling Tupperware products had been \nshrinking, with a 7% annual decline in the United States and Canada, a 16% drop in \nSouth America, and a 22% decline in Asia. Worldwide, the company had a little over \nhalf a million active sellers. These declines followed years of sagging revenues and \nprofits, as consumers no longer had a strong connection with the brand.\nIn 2020, things changed. \nPeople were spending more \ntime at home due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, cook-\ning their own food, and \nlooking for ways to store \nleftovers. Even as restau-\nrants lost revenue, demand \nfor Tupperware’s products \nincreased dramatically. The \nstock nearly quadrupled in \nshare price in 2020, ac-\ncompanied by increasing \nrevenues and profits.\nUnfortunately, Tupper-\nware’s fortunes changed \nrather quickly as the initial \neffects from COVID-19 \nwore off, and the markets in \nwhich the company competes \nnormalized. The stock slipped \nagain and company executives \nbegan buying up shares. The company also added three board members to help \ndevelop a turnaround strategy. To slim down its operations and focus on what is \nmost important, Tupperware began selling some of its non-core businesses, such as \nits House of Fuller beauty business in Mexico and its Avroy Shain beauty business in \nSouth Africa. In addition, the company sold off some of its real estate holdings near \nits headquarters in Orlando, Florida. \nEven as the company was slimming down, it developed ambitious plans for \ngrowth. Tupperware had plans to open a global sourcing center in Singapore to man-\nage product innovation and growth into new markets. According to Sandra Harris, \nchief operations officer, Tupperware is planning to expand beyond its current busi-\nnesses into new markets that serve more customer needs. It is still uncertain whether \nthe company will regain competitiveness. The industries in which Tupperware  \ncompetes are flooded with high-end competitors as well as cheap imitations for what \nthe company sells.\nSources: A.

Tupperware’s diversification into beauty products fit nicely with \nthe concept of marketing products through private sellers. However, the beauty products market is \nalso flooded with competitors. For a while it appeared that changes in the environment associated \nwith the pandemic were going to reinvigorate the Tupperware brand; however, growth was fleet-\ning, and now that things have normalized, Tupperware is basically trying to reinvent itself through \nproduct innovations and expansion into new markets through its new facility in Singapore.\nAs noted in Chapter 1, the characteristics of today’s external environment differ from histor-\nical conditions. For example, technological changes and the continuing growth of information \ngathering and processing capabilities increase the need for firms to develop effective competitive \nactions and responses on a timely basis.2 (We fully discuss competitive actions and responses in \nChapter 5). Additionally, the rapid sociological changes occurring in many countries affect labor \npractices and the nature of products that an increasingly diverse group of consumers demand. \nGovernmental policies and laws also affect where and how firms choose to compete.3 And, changes \nto several nations’ financial regulatory systems were enacted after the financial crisis in 2008–2009 \nthat increased the complexity of organizations’ financial transactions.4\nFirms understand the external environment by acquiring information about competitors, cus-\ntomers, and other stakeholders to build their own base of knowledge.5 On the basis of the new \ninformation, firms take actions, such as building new capabilities and core competencies, in the \nhope of buffering themselves from any negative environmental effects and to pursue opportunities \nto better serve their stakeholders’ needs.6\nA firm’s competitive actions and responses are influenced by conditions in the three parts of its \nexternal environment—the general environment, the industry environment, and the competitor \nenvironment (see Figure 2.1)—and its understanding of those conditions.7 Next, we fully describe \neach part of the firm’s external environment.\nLearning Objective \n2-1 Explain the \nimportance of analyzing \nand understanding \nthe firm’s external \nenvironment. \nEconomic\nTechnological\nSociocultural\nSustainable\nPhysical \nPolitical/Legal\nDemographic\nIndustry\nEnvironment\nThreat of New Entrants\nPower of Suppliers\nPower of Buyers\nProduct Substitutes\nIntensity of Rivalry\nCompetitor\nEnvironment\nGlobal\nFigure 2.1 The External Environment \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Examples of elements analyzed in each of these segments are shown in Table 2.1.\nFirms cannot directly control the general environment’s segments. Accordingly, what a com-\npany seeks to do is recognize trends in each segment of the general environment and then predict \neach trend’s effect. For example, it has been predicted that over the next 10 to 20 years, millions of \npeople living in emerging market countries will join the middle class. In fact, by 2030, it is predicted \nthat two-thirds of the global middle class, about 525 million people, will live in the Asia-Pacific \nregion of the world.9 Of course, this is not surprising given that almost 60 percent of the world’s \npopulation is located in Asia.10 No firm, including large multinationals, is able to control where \ngrowth in potential customers may take place in the next couple of decades. Nonetheless, firms \nmust study this anticipated trend as a foundation for predicting its effects on their ability to identify \nstrategies to use that will allow them to remain successful as market conditions change.\nThe industry environment is the set of factors that directly influences a firm and its com-\npetitive actions and responses: the threat of new entrants, the power of suppliers, the power of \nbuyers, the threat of product substitutes, and the intensity of rivalry among competing firms.11 In \ntotal, the interactions among these five factors determine an industry’s profitability potential; in \nturn, the industry’s profitability potential influences the choices each firm makes about its com-\npetitive actions and responses. The challenge for a firm is to locate a position within an industry \nwhere it can favorably influence the five factors or where it can successfully defend itself against \ntheir influence. The greater a firm’s capacity to favorably influence its industry environment, the \ngreater the likelihood it will earn above-average returns.\nIn competitor analysis, firms gather and interpret information about their competi-\ntors. Understanding the firm’s competitor environment complements the insights provided \nLearning Objective \n2-2 Define and describe \nthe general environment \nand the industry \nenvironment. \nThe general environment \nis composed of dimensions \nin the broader society that \ninfluence an industry and the \nfirms within it.\nThe industry environment \nis the set of factors that \ndirectly influences a firm \nand its competitive actions \nand responses: the threat \nof new entrants, the power \nof suppliers, the power of \nbuyers, the threat of product \nsubstitutes, and the intensity \nof rivalry among competing \nfirms.\nIn competitor analysis, \nfirms gather and interpret \ninformation about their \ncompetitors.\nDemographic \n segment\n \n●\nPopulation size\n \n●\nAge structure\n \n●\nGeographic distribution\n \n●\nEthnic mix\n \n●\nIncome distribution\nEconomic segment\n \n●\nInflation rates\n \n●\nInterest rates\n \n●\nTrade deficits or surpluses\n \n●\nBudget deficits or surpluses\n \n●\nPersonal savings rate\n \n●\nBusiness savings rates\n \n●\nGross domestic product\nPolitical/Legal \n segment\n \n●\nAntitrust laws\n \n●\nTaxation laws\n \n●\nDeregulation philosophies\n \n●\nLabor training laws\n \n●\nEducational philosophies and policies\nSociocultural \n segment\n \n●\nWomen in the workforce\n \n●\nWorkforce diversity\n \n●\nAttitudes about the quality of work life\n \n●\nShifts in work and career preferences\n \n●\nShifts in preferences regarding product and service  \ncharacteristics\nTechnological \n segment\n \n●\nProduct innovations\n \n●\nApplications of knowledge\n \n●\nFocus of private and government-supported  \nR&D expenditures\n \n●\nNew communication technologies\nGlobal segment\n \n●\nImportant political events\n \n●\nCritical global markets\n \n●\nNewly industrialized countries\n \n●\nDifferent cultural and institutional attributes\nSustainable  physical \nenvironment \n segment\n \n●\nEnergy consumption\n \n●\nPractices used to develop energy \nsources\n \n●\nRenewable energy efforts\n \n●\nMinimizing a firm’s environmental \nfootprint\n \n●\nAvailability of water as a resource\n \n●\nProducing environmentally friendly products\n \n●\nReacting to natural or man-made disasters\nTable 2.1 The General Environment: Segments and Elements\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In combination, the results of these three analyses influence \nthe firm’s vision, mission, values, choice of strategies, and the competitive actions and responses \nit will take to implement those strategies. Although we discuss each analysis separately, the firm \ncan develop and implement a more effective strategy when it successfully integrates the insights \nprovided by analyses of the general environment, the industry environment, and the competitive \nenvironment. \n2-3 External Environmental Analysis\nMost firms face external environments that are turbulent, complex, and global. These conditions \nmake interpreting environments difficult.13 To cope with often ambiguous and incomplete envi-\nronmental data and to increase understanding of the general environment, firms complete an \nexternal environmental analysis. This analysis has four parts: scanning, monitoring, forecasting, \nand assessing (see Table 2.2).\nIdentifying opportunities and threats is an important objective of studying the general environ-\nment. An opportunity is a condition in the general environment that, if exploited effectively, helps \na company achieve strategic competitiveness. For example, an aging population in the United States \nis providing opportunities for companies in health care and nursing homes, and advances in tech-\nnology have created opportunities for educational institutions worldwide to offer new programs, \neven in developing nations.14 Most companies—and certainly large ones—continuously encounter \nmultiple opportunities as well as threats. \nA threat is a condition in the general environment that may hinder a company’s efforts to \nachieve strategic competitiveness.15 Intellectual property protection has become a significant \nissue not only within a country but also across country borders. For example, during his pres-\nidency, President Donald Trump placed tariffs on goods exported from China into the United \nStates. The primary reason given for the tariffs was the theft of U.S. firms’ intellectual property \nby Chinese firms. As is common in these cases, China responded by placing tariffs on a large \nnumber of U.S. products exported to China, sparking fears of a potential trade war between  \nthe two countries with the largest economies in the world. This type of threat is associated with \nthe political/legal segment.\nFirms use multiple sources to analyze the general environment through scanning, monitoring, \nforecasting, and assessing. Examples of these sources include a wide variety of printed materials \n(such as trade publications, newspapers, business publications, and the results of academic research \nand public polls), trade shows, and suppliers, customers, and employees of public-sector organiza-\ntions. Also, the information available from Internet sources is of increasing importance to a firm’s \nefforts to study the general environment.\nLearning Objective \n2-3 Discuss the four \nparts of the external \nenvironmental analysis \nprocess.\nTable 2.2 Parts of the External Environment Analysis\nScanning\n \n●\nIdentifying early signals of environmental changes and trends\nMonitoring\n \n●\nDetecting meaning through ongoing observations of environmental \nchanges and trends\nForecasting\n \n●\nDeveloping projections of anticipated outcomes based on monitored \nchanges and trends\nAssessing\n \n●\nDetermining the timing and importance of environmental changes and \ntrends for firms’ strategies and their management\nAn opportunity is a \ncondition in the general \nenvironment that, if \nexploited effectively, helps \na company reach strategic \ncompetitiveness.\nA threat is a condition in \nthe general environment \nthat may hinder a company’s \nefforts to achieve strategic \ncompetitiveness.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Although challenging, scan-\nning is critically important to the firms’ efforts to understand trends in the general environment \nand to predict their implications. This is particularly the case for companies competing in highly \nvolatile environments.16\nThrough scanning, firms identify early signals of potential changes in the general environ-\nment and detect changes that are already under way.17 Scanning activities must be aligned with the \norganizational context; a scanning system designed for a volatile environment is inappropriate for \na firm in a stable environment.18 Scanning often reveals ambiguous, incomplete, or unconnected \ndata and information that require careful analysis.\nMany firms use special software to help them identify events that are taking place in the \nenvironment and that are announced in public sources. For example, news event detection uses \ninformation-based systems to categorize text and reduce the trade-off between an important \nmissed event and false alarm rates. Increasingly, these systems are used to study social media outlets  \nas sources of information.19\nBroadly speaking, the Internet provides a wealth of opportunities for scanning. Amazon.com, \nfor example, records information about individuals visiting its website, particularly if a purchase \nis made. The firm sends messages to customers about specials and new products similar to those \nthey purchased in previous visits. A number of other companies, such as Netflix, also collect demo-\ngraphic data about their customers in an attempt to identify their unique preferences (demograph-\nics is one of the segments in the general environment). Nearly 5 billion people use the Internet in \nsome way, so the Internet represents a healthy opportunity to gather information on users.20 The \ninformation technologies associated with analyzing big data, described in Chapter 1, are helpful in \nacquiring and managing this information.\n2-3b Monitoring\nWhen monitoring, analysts observe environmental changes to see if an important trend is emerging \nfrom among those spotted through scanning.21 Effective monitoring requires the firm to identify \nimportant stakeholders and understand its reputation among these stakeholders as the foundation \nfor serving their unique needs.22 One means of monitoring major stakeholders is by using directors \nthat serve on other boards of directors (referred to as interlocking directorates). They facilitate \ninformation and knowledge transfer from external sources.23 Monitoring, like scanning, is partic-\nularly important when a firm competes in an industry with high technological uncertainty.24 For \nexample, the pharmaceutical, gaming, and delivery service industries are all experiencing high \nlevels of uncertainty because of technological advances. Scanning and monitoring can also serve as \na means of importing knowledge about markets and about how to successfully commercialize the \nnew technologies the firm has developed.25\n2-3c \nForecasting\nScanning and monitoring are concerned with events and trends in the general environment at a \npoint in time. When forecasting, analysts develop feasible projections of what might happen, and \nhow quickly, as a result of the events and trends detected through scanning and monitoring.26 For \nexample, analysts might forecast the time that will be required for a new technology to reach the \nmarketplace, the length of time before different corporate training procedures are required to deal \nwith anticipated changes in the composition of the workforce, or how much time will elapse before \nchanges in governmental taxation policies affect consumers’ purchasing patterns. COVID-19  \nresulted in many changes to the way businesses function, and especially in the work environment.27 \nPlanning for a post-pandemic business environment should be among a firm’s highest planning \npriorities.\nForecasting events and outcomes accurately is challenging. Forecasting demand for new tech-\nnological products is difficult because technology trends are continually shortening product life \ncycles. This is particularly difficult for a firm such as Intel (the semiconductor chip maker), whose \nproducts go into many customers’ technological products, which are frequently updated. Thus, \nhaving access to tools that allow better forecasting of electronic product demand is of value to Intel \nas the firm studies conditions in its external environment.28\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The intent of assessment is \nto specify the implications of that understanding. Without assessment, the firm has data that may \nbe interesting but of unknown competitive relevance. \nAccurately assessing the trends expected to take place in the segments of a firm’s general envi-\nronment is important. However, accurately interpreting the meaning of those trends is even more \nimportant. In slightly different words, although gathering and organizing information is import-\nant, appropriately interpreting that information to determine if an identified trend in the general \nenvironment is an opportunity or threat is critical.30 Then this information can be used to help the \nfirm devise strategies to take advantage of opportunities or overcome threats.\nOne of the most difficult general environment trends to assess is influence of the increasing \nuse of cryptocurrencies, digital currencies that do not rely on any central authority such as a bank \nor government.31 Instead, they are managed through what is known as a distributed ledger (block-\nchain) that is controlled by a decentralized network of interconnected computer systems. Bitcoin \nwas the first popular decentralized cryptocurrency; however, many other cryptocurrencies have \nbeen created. On the surface, it would appear that the use of cryptocurrencies presents an oppor-\ntunity to businesses because of their ability to increase the efficiency of international economic \nexchanges. However, there is so much uncertainty that it is hard to predict what is going to happen \nwith cryptocurrencies in the future.32 Some of the sources of uncertainty include government reg-\nulation and taxation as well as the extreme volatility in the value of these currencies, which makes \nowning them very risky.33 Also, China has entered this space with its electronic yuan, a government- \nissued digital currency.34 Will this become a new trend and, if so, is this a threat or an opportunity?\n2-4 Seven Segments of the General \nEnvironment\nThe general environment is composed of segments that are external to the firm (see Table 2.1). \nAlthough the degree of impact varies, these environmental segments affect all industries and the \nfirms competing in them. The challenge to each firm is to scan, monitor, forecast, and assess the \nelements in each segment to predict their effects on it. These activities are vital to the firm’s efforts \nto recognize and evaluate opportunities and threats.\n2-4a The Demographic Segment\nThe demographic segment is concerned with a population’s size, age structure, geographic distri-\nbution, ethnic mix, and income distribution.35 Demographic segments are commonly analyzed on \na global basis because of their potential effects across countries’ borders and because many firms \ncompete in global markets.\nPopulation Size\nThe world’s population doubled (from 3 billion to 6 billion) between 1959 and 1999. Current pro-\njections suggest that population growth will continue in the twenty-first century, but at a slower \npace. In 2022, the world’s population was approximately 8 billion, and is projected to grow at about \n1 percent per year for the foreseeable future.36 In that same year, China was the world’s largest \ncountry by population with slightly with over 1.4 billion people. India, the second most populous, \nis growing at a faster rate than China, and will surpass China in population in the near future. \nRounding out the top five nations are the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan. Firms seeking to \nfind growing markets in which to sell their goods and services need to consider the market poten-\ntial that may exist for them in these five nations.\nAge Structure\nThe most noteworthy aspect of this element of the demographic segment is that the world’s popu-\nlation is rapidly aging.37 Projections suggest life expectancy will surpass 100 in some industrialized \nLearning Objective \n2-4 Name and \ndescribe the general \nenvironment’s seven \nsegments.\nThe demographic \nsegment is concerned \nwith a population’s size, \nage structure, geographic \ndistribution, ethnic mix, and \nincome distribution.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

However, 47 is now \nthe median age in Japan and Germany.39 By 2050, almost 25 percent of the world’s population will \nbe aged 65 or older. These changes in the age of the population have significant implications for \navailability of qualified labor, health care, retirement policies, and business opportunities among \nothers.40\nThis aging of the population threatens the ability of firms to hire and retain a workforce that \nmeets their needs. Thus, firms are challenged to increase the productivity of their workers and/or \nto establish additional operations in other nations in order to access the potential working age pop-\nulation. This type of internationalization has been increasing for years, especially in nations such \nas India, Brazil, or China where labor costs are lower and there are many talented workers.41 The \nintroductory case described how Tupperware is moving a lot of its innovation and market develop-\nment activities to Singapore, a small country with a well-educated workforce.\nAnother potential opportunity is represented by delayed retirements; older workers with \nextended life expectancies may need to work longer in order to eventually afford retirement. Firms \ncan use their older, more experienced workers to transfer their knowledge to younger employees, \nhelping them to quickly gain valuable skills. In addition, there is an opportunity for firms to more \neffectively use the talent available in the workforce. For example, moving women into higher-level \nprofessional and managerial jobs could offset the challenges created by a decline in overall talent \navailability. And, based on research, eliminating the “glass ceiling” that keeps women from moving \nto top leadership positions may even enhance overall performance.42\nGeographic Distribution\nHow a population is distributed within countries and regions is subject to change over time. For \nexample, over the last few decades the U.S. population has shifted from states in the Northeast and \nGreat Lakes region to states in the West (California), South (Florida), and Southwest (Texas).43 \nThese changes are characterized as moving from the “Frost Belt” to the “Sun Belt.” Outcomes \nfrom these shifts include the fact that the gross domestic product (GDP) of California in 2021 was \nestimated to be more than $3.1 trillion, an amount that would make California the fifth-largest \neconomy in the world if it were a country. In this same year, at a value of over $1.7 trillion, Texas’ \nGDP was second to that of California.44\nFirms want to carefully study the patterns of population distributions in countries and regions \nto identify opportunities and threats. Thus, in the United States, current patterns suggest the pos-\nsibility of opportunities in states on the West Coast and some in the South and Southwest. In \ncontrast, firms competing in the Northeast and Great Lakes areas may concentrate on identifying \nthreats to their ability to operate profitably in those areas, and then devising strategies to overcome \nthem.\nOf course, geographic distribution patterns differ throughout the world. For example, in past \nyears, the majority of the population in China lived in rural areas; however, growth patterns have \nbeen shifting to urban communities such as Shanghai and Beijing. In fact, there are now more \nChinese living in urban areas than in rural areas.45 Overall, the geographic distribution patterns in \nEurope have been reasonably stable.46\nEthnic Mix\nThe ethnic mix of countries’ populations continues to change, creating opportunities and threats \nfor many companies as a result. For example, Hispanics have become the largest ethnic minority in \nthe United States.47 In fact, the U.S. Hispanic market is the third-largest “Latin American” economy \nbehind Brazil and Mexico. Spanish is now the dominant language in parts of the United States such \nas Texas, California, Florida, and New Mexico. Given these facts, some firms might want to assess \nhow their goods or services could be adapted to serve the unique needs of Hispanic consumers. \nInterestingly, the population in the United States is projected to have a majority of minority  \nethnic members by 2044. And, by 2060, Caucasians are projected to compose approximately  \n44 percent of the U.S. population.48 The ethnic diversity of the population is important not only \nbecause of consumer needs but also because of the labor force composition. Research has shown \nthat firms with greater ethnic diversity in their managerial teams and workforce are likely to enjoy \nhigher performance.49\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

For example, Afri-\ncan countries are the most ethnically diverse in the world, with Uganda having the highest ethnic \ndiversity rating and Liberia having the second highest. In contrast, Japan and the Koreas are the \nleast ethnically diversified in their populations. European countries are largely ethnically homo-\ngeneous while the Americas are more diverse. “From the United States through Central America \ndown to Brazil, the ‘new world’ countries, maybe in part because of their histories of relatively open \nimmigration (and, in some cases, intermingling between natives and new arrivals) tend to be pretty \ndiverse.”50\nIncome Distribution\nUnderstanding how income is distributed within and across populations informs firms of different \ngroups’ purchasing power and discretionary income. Of particular interest to firms are the aver-\nage incomes of households and individuals. For instance, the increase in dual-career couples has \nhad a notable effect on average incomes. Although real income has been declining in general in \nsome nations, the household income of dual-career couples has increased, as has the number of \ndual-career couples, especially in the United States.51 This trend offers opportunities to companies \nthat offer goods and services to people who don’t have time to cook, clean, shop, or run errands. \nFor example, Uber has been able to expand from providing ground transportation to providing \ndelivery services for local restaurants through Uber Eats.52\nThe growth of the economy in China has drawn many firms, not only for the low-cost produc-\ntion, but also because of the large potential demand for products, given its large population base. \nHowever, in recent times, the amount of China’s gross domestic product that makes up domestic \nconsumption is the lowest of any major economy at less than one-third. In comparison, India’s \ndomestic consumption of consumer goods accounts for two-thirds of its economy, or twice China’s \nlevel. For this reason, many Western multinationals are interested in India as a consumption market \nas its middle class grows; although India has poor infrastructure, its consumers are in a better posi-\ntion to spend. Because of situations such as this, paying attention to the differences between markets \nbased on income distribution can be very important.53 These differences across nations suggest it \nis important for firms that operate internationally to identify the economic systems that are most \nlikely to produce the most income growth and market opportunities.54 Thus, the economic segment \nis a critically important focus of a firm’s environmental analysis.\n2-4b The Economic Segment\nThe economic environment refers to the nature and direction of the economy in which a firm \ncompetes or may compete.55 In general, firms seek to compete in relatively stable economies with \nstrong growth potential. Because nations are interconnected as a result of the global economy, \nfirms must scan, monitor, forecast, and assess the health of their host nation as well as the health \nof the economies outside it.\nIt is challenging for firms studying the economic environment to predict economic trends that \nmay occur and their effects on them. Global recessions, like what is sometimes called the “Great \nRecession” that started late in 2007, can create numerous problems for companies throughout the \nworld, including problems of reduced consumer demand, increases in firms’ inventory levels, devel-\nopment of additional governmental regulations, and a tightening of access to financial resources.56\nOf course, major shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic can be just as difficult for firms as reces-\nsions because of supply chain disruptions and dramatic reductions in consumer demand, espe-\ncially in industries related to travel and hospitality (restaurants, hotels). During the pandemic, tech \ncompanies that supply products and services that allow people to work and play at home—such as \nMicrosoft, Apple, and Zoom—thrived. Tupperware, discussed in the Opening Case, and Nestle, \nthe world’s largest packaged food maker, also did very well.57 But for all firms, a high level of uncer-\ntainty made management difficult. Research has found that the negative effects of the COVID-19 \nepidemic on firm performance were greater in countries with more advanced financial systems and \nbetter healthcare systems.58\nInflation is another factor that needs to be closely monitored. Rapid price increases in both \nconsumer goods and the prices charged to producers for the materials they need can create a lot \nof economic instability. Producers pass price increases on to consumers, who then reduce their \nconsumption until wages are increased. Higher wages result in more demand for goods and \nThe economic \nenvironment refers to the \nnature and direction of the \neconomy in which a firm \ncompetes or may compete.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

During a period of high inflation, \nsmaller businesses tend to have a more difficult time than \nlarger businesses because they have fewer resources to draw \non to ride out the difficult economic situation.59\nOne of the tools governments use to calm down inflation \nis increasing interest rates; however, as interest rates increase \nbusinesses find new projects less attractive because the costs \nof financing them increase. Reductions in business investment \ncan reduce economic growth, so governments are cautions.60 \nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government passed \nmultiple stimulus bills that provided direct payments to indi-\nviduals and even incentivized unemployed people not to look \nfor work. These payments overstimulated the economy and \nsimultaneous supply chain problems reduced the supply of \ngoods, resulting in demand that outstripped supply. The result \nwas very high inflation. \nStudying closely and forecasting economic growth and \nother trends in the economies in which firms operate can help them to determine where the great-\nest growth opportunities exist. This, in turn, can help them achieve above-average returns.\n2-4c \nThe Political/Legal Segment\nThe political/legal segment is the arena in which organizations and interest groups compete for \nattention, resources, and a voice in overseeing the body of laws and regulations guiding interac-\ntions among nations as well as between firms and various government agencies.61 Essentially, this \nsegment is concerned with how organizations try to influence governments and how they try to \nunderstand the influences (current and projected) of those governments on their competitive \nactions and responses. Commonly, firms develop a strategy to specify how they will analyze the \npolitical/legal segment in order to develop approaches they can take (such as lobbying efforts) \nto successfully deal with opportunities and threats that surface within this segment of the envi-\nronment.62 This type of strategy is frequently referred to as a non-market strategy because it does \nnot deal directly with competition in a particular product market (non-market strategies will be \nexamined in Chapter 5).\nRegulations formed in response to new national, regional, state, and/or local laws that are leg-\nislated often influence a firm’s competitive actions and responses.63 For example, many states in \nthe United States have now legalized the retail selling of cannabis (also known as marijuana). The \nimmediate concern is the risk that firms take to invest capital in this business, given that it is \nunknown whether the U.S. Department of Justice will allow the states to proceed without enforcing \nfederal law against the sale of this product. Thus, the relationship between national, regional, and \nlocal laws and regulations creates a highly complex environment within which businesses must \nnavigate.64\nFor interactive, technology-based firms such as Facebook, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon, \namong others, the effort in Europe to adopt the world’s strongest data protection laws has signif-\nicant challenges. Highly restrictive laws about consumer privacy could threaten how these firms \nconduct business in the European Union. Alternatively, firms must deal with quite different chal-\nlenges when they operate in countries with weak formal institutions (e.g., weak legal protection of \nintellectual property). Laws and regulations provide structure to guide strategic and competitive \nactions; without such structure, it is difficult to identify the best strategic actions.65\n2-4d The Sociocultural Segment\nThe sociocultural segment is concerned with a society’s attitudes and cultural values. Because \nattitudes and values form the cornerstone of a society, they often drive demographic, economic, \npolitical/legal, and technological conditions and changes.\nIndividual societies’ attitudes and cultural orientations are relatively stable, but they can and \noften do change over time. Thus, firms must carefully scan, monitor, forecast, and assess them to \nrecognize and study associated opportunities and threats. Successful firms must also be aware of \nThe sociocultural segment \nis concerned with a society’s \nattitudes and cultural values.\nThe political/legal \nsegment is the arena in \nwhich organizations and \ninterest groups compete \nfor attention, resources, and \na voice in overseeing the \nbody of laws and regulations \nguiding interactions among \nnations as well as between \nfirms and various local \ngovernmental agencies.\nA marijuana budtender sorts strands of marijuana for sale at a \nretail and medical cannabis dispensary in Boulder, Colorado.\nAP Images/Brennan Linsley\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Indeed, \nfirms must identify changes in cultural values, norms, \nand attitudes in order to “adapt to stay ahead of their \ncompetitors and stay relevant in the minds of their con-\nsumers.”66 Research has shown that sociocultural factors \ninfluence entry into new markets and the development \nof new firms in a country.67\nAlthough some social movements, such as the push \nto reduce global warming and protect the environment \n(to be discussed later in this chapter), are international \nin scope, each country has unique sociocultural indica-\ntors. National cultural values affect behavior in organi-\nzations and thus also influence organizational outcomes \nsuch as the success associated with differences in mana-\ngerial styles. Likewise, national culture influences a large \nportion of the internationalization strategy that firms \npursue relative to one’s home country.68\nKnowledge sharing and training is important for \ndispersing knowledge about what is happening and \nwhat is considered acceptable in each of the countries in which a firm operates. This knowledge is \nessential to successful management. As one example, personal relationships are especially import-\nant in China; the concept of guanxi (personal relationships or good connections) is important in \ndoing business within the country and for individuals to advance their careers in what is becoming \na more open market society. Understanding the importance of guanxi is critical for foreign firms \ndoing business in China.69\nIn the United States, a social movement called “Black Lives Matter” gained strength after a \nvideo was released to social media that showed a police officer unjustly taking the life of a black \nsuspect during an arrest. The fight for racial equality is not new to the United States, and it is also \na major issue in most Western, and some other, countries. However, the video and subsequent \nprotests and riots re-invigorated the movement. There are many reasons that firms should be sen-\nsitive to racial equality and equal justice. Indeed, firms that ignore these issues increase their risk \nof harmful outcomes such as negative social media, a soiled reputation, boycotts, lost sales, and an \ninability to attract the best qualified workers.70\n2-4e The Technological Segment\nPervasive and diversified in scope, technological changes affect many parts of societies. These \neffects occur primarily through new products, processes, and materials. The technological \nsegment includes the institutions and activities involved in creating new knowledge and translat-\ning that knowledge into new outputs, products, processes, and materials.\nGiven the rapid pace of technological change and risk of disruption, it is vital for firms to \nthoroughly study the technological segment.71 The importance of these efforts is shown by the fact \nthat early adopters of new technology often achieve higher market shares and earn higher returns. \nThus, both large and small firms should continuously scan the general environment to identify \npotential substitutes for technologies that are in current use, as well as to identify newly emerging \ntechnologies from which their firms could derive competitive advantage.72\nNew technology and innovations are changing many industries.73 These changes are exem-\nplified by the change to digital publishing (e.g., electronic books), the adoption of AI technol-\nogies in many industries, retail industries moving from brick-and-mortar stores to Internet \nsales, and the rise of the metaverse, which combines virtual reality, augmented reality, and \n3D computing (note also that Facebook is now called Meta Platforms Inc.).74 As such, firms \nin all industries must become more innovative in order to survive, and must develop new  \nor at least comparable technology—and continuously improve it.75 In so doing, most firms \nmust have a sophisticated information system to support their new product development \nefforts.76\nDuring the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, companies were \n“expected” by employees and customers to address racial equality and \ninjustice.\nThe  technological \nsegment includes the \ninstitutions and activities \ninvolved in creating new \nknowledge and translating \nthat knowledge into new \noutputs, products, processes, \nand materials.\nFibs.Z/Shutterstock.com\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Companies continue to study the \nInternet’s capabilities to anticipate how it may allow them to create more value for customers and \nto anticipate future trends. Additionally, the Internet generates a significant number of opportu-\nnities and threats for firms across the world. One of the most significant global changes that has \noccurred largely because of the Internet is the increase in digital platforms that have led to what is \nsometimes called the sharing economy, a socioeconomic system that uses information technology \nto link stakeholders to each other.77 These systems facilitate transfer of information, but they also \nallow firms to create more value by sharing their excess capacities of products, services, and inno-\nvative technologies.\nIn addition to the Internet’s far-reaching effects and the opportunities and threats associated \nwith its potential, wireless communication technology has also become a significant technological \nopportunity for companies. Handheld devices and other wireless communications equipment are \nused to access a variety of network-based services. The use of handheld computers (of many types) \nwith wireless network connectivity has become a dominant form of communication and commerce, \nand additional functionalities and software applications are generating multiple opportunities—and \npotential threats—for companies of all types.\n2-4f \nThe Global Segment\nThe global segment includes relevant new global markets and their critical cultural and institu-\ntional characteristics, existing markets that are changing, and important international political \nevents.78 For example, firms competing in the automobile industry must study the global segment. \nThis is supported by the fact that consumers in multiple nations are willing to buy cars and trucks \nfrom wherever they are manufactured, and the best suppliers of parts and components often are \nnot in the same country where an automobile is assembled.\nWhen studying the global segment, firms should recognize that globalization of business mar-\nkets may create opportunities to enter new markets, as well as threats that new competitors from \nother economies may also enter their market.79 In addition, it is challenging to determine how well \na firm’s products and services will be received in a foreign market, and differences in political and \nlegal systems can also cause difficulties for firms that have globalized. In fact, what a firm does in \none international region that provides competitive advantages could lead to competitive disadvan-\ntages in another region.80\nOf course, a firm that has operations in a foreign market is also at risk that a major event could \ndramatically alter both the political and economic conditions in that country. Consider, for exam-\nple, what happened when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Western companies like McDonald’s, \nCoca-Cola, and IBM ceased operations in Russia, even as Russian prosecutors warned these \ncompanies that their assets could be seized and their leaders arrested. Many banks froze Russian \naccounts, making trade difficult. Companies that had invested in Russia were at risk of losing their \nentire investments.81\nIn light of threats associated with participating in international markets, some firms choose to \ntake a more cautious approach to globalization. For example, family business firms, even the larger \nones, often take a conservative approach to entering international markets in a manner very similar \nto how they approach the development and introduction of new technology. They try to manage \ntheir risk.82 These firms participate in what some refer to as globalfocusing, in which firms focus on \nglobal niche markets.83 This approach allows firms to build onto and use their core competencies \nwhile limiting their risks within the niche market. Another way in which firms limit their risks in \ninternational markets is to focus their operations and sales in one region of the world.84 Success \nwith these efforts lets a firm build knowledge of its markets and relationships with stakeholders, \nwhich can lead to successful business expansion in the future.\nFirms competing in global markets should recognize each market’s sociocultural and institu-\ntional attributes.85 For example, Korean ideology emphasizes communitarianism, a characteristic \nof many Asian countries. Alternatively, as mentioned previously, the ideology in China calls \nfor an emphasis on guanxi—personal connections—while in Japan, the focus is on wa—group \nharmony and social cohesion.86 The institutional context of China suggests a major emphasis \non centralized planning by the government. The Chinese government provides incentives to \nThe global segment \nincludes relevant new global \nmarkets and their critical \ncultural and institutional \ncharacteristics, existing \nmarkets that are changing, \nand important international \npolitical events.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The informal economy refers to economic activities that have market value but are not \nrecorded as part of the activities of registered business organizations.89 Examples include mini-\nbus drivers in Africa, hawkers selling goods all around the world, and gig workers—independent \ncontractors who engage in short-term work, often for multiple employers. Approximately  \n60 percent of the world’s population participates in some way in the informal economy.90 Grow-\ning in size, this economy has implications for firms’ competitive actions and responses because \nfirms competing in the formal economy find that they are competing against informal economy \nparticipants as well.\n2-4g The Sustainable Physical Environment Segment\nThe sustainable physical environment segment refers to potential and actual changes in the \nphysical environment as well as business practices that are intended to positively respond \nto those changes in order to create a sustainable environment.91 Concerned with trends that \nthreaten the world’s physical environment, such as global climate change, firms recognize \nthat ecological, social, and economic systems interactively influence what happens in this \nparticular segment and that they are part of an interconnected global society.92 These con-\ncerns are magnified by strong social movements that mean firms cannot afford to ignore \ntheir impact on the natural environment. Because of its importance to businesses throughout \nthe world, sustainability has been and will continue to be addressed throughout many parts \nof this book.\nCompanies across the globe are taking actions to protect the environment, such as reducing \ntheir carbon emissions, reforesting areas that have been decimated by industrialization, increasing \nthe efficiency of their operations through new technologies, reducing waste, or increasing their use \nof sustainable materials. \nCertification programs have been developed to help firms understand how to become more \nsustainable organizations.93 For example, firms can achieve B Corporation certification (which is \nnot the same as a benefit organization) for meeting high standards of performance in areas asso-\nciated with sustainability.94 (B Corp Certification and benefit corporations will be discussed fur-\nther in Chapter 11.) To achieve this type of certification, firms must verify that their actions are \nconsistent with what they claim. ISO standards are similar in their underlying emphasis on sus-\ntainability.95 These standards are based directly on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of \nthe United Nations. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) offers a number of \ndifferent certification programs.\nAlmost all large companies are outlining these sorts of activities in reports with names such as \n“Sustainability” or “Corporate Social Responsibility.” However, some firms are using these types of \nreports, social media, advertising campaigns, and press releases to create a public perception that \nthey are environmentally responsible when, in fact, they have made very few changes that are con-\nsistent with this perception. This type of activity, called greenwashing (first mentioned in Chapter 1),  \ncarries with it some very real risks that stakeholders will figure out what they are doing, thus losing \ntrust in the firm. A loss of trust can be accompanied by negative stakeholder reactions such as lost \nsales, legal suits, negative social media campaigns, or an unwillingness of suppliers to sell products \nto the company.96\nAs the Strategic Focus shows, although some companies are using greenwashing to create a per-\nception of social responsibility, others really mean it. Shaw Industries has a competitive advantage \ndue to its reputation for sustainable business practices.\nAs this discussion shows, identifying changes and trends among segments of the general envi-\nronment allows firms to identify opportunities and threats. It is necessary to have a top management \nteam with the experience, knowledge, and sensitivity required to effectively analyze conditions in a \nfirm’s general environment, as well as other facets such as the industry environment and competi-\ntors.97 Next, we focus on those other important sections of external analysis.\nThe sustainable physical \nenvironment segment \nrefers to potential and actual \nchanges in the physical \nenvironment as well as \nbusiness practices that \nare intended to positively \nrespond to those changes in \norder to create a sustainable \nenvironment.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The negative consequences of global climate change \nare reported daily in a variety of media outlets.\nThe floor coverings industry has struggled at times due to its \nimage as a “dirty” industry. Carpet manufacturing releases chemicals \ninto the environment and uses a lot of water and energy. Most car-\npets are made of synthetic or man-made materials such as polyester, \nnylon, polypropylene, or olefin, which often use oil as a feedstock. In \nthe United States alone, more than 4 billion pounds of carpet ends up \nin landfills every year, which is 1 percent by weight but 2 percent by \nvolume of all solid waste.\nGiven the environmental challenges associated with this indus-\ntry, it is amazing that one of the world’s largest carpet manufacturers \nhas made great progress in “greening” its operations. Shaw Industries \nGroup, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway and employer of more \nthan 20,000 people worldwide, is proud of its environmental perfor-\nmance, and uses it to gain advantage through its reputation with \nconsumers. Almost 90 percent of Shaw’s products have received \nCradle-to-Cradle certification, which focuses on material health, \nmaterial reutilization, water conservation, renewable energy and car-\nbon management, and social fairness. Shaw also has a carpet take-\nback program through which carpeting is reclaimed and turned into \nnew carpet or down-cycled into other types of products. Consistent \nwith this emphasis on sustainability, Shaw is also one of signatories of \nthe United Nations Global Compact, principles for upholding human \nrights, protecting the environment, and fighting corruption.\nShaw engaged in a program to reduce its greenhouse gas emis-\nsions by 40 percent by 2030, but achieved the goal nine years early. \nThe company achieved this objective through a combination of \nreducing energy consumption, switching to cleaner fuels, and pro-\nducing their own renewable energy in some of their plants.  Shaw \nalso ensures that the products it buys from other companies are man-\nufactured with high standards with regard to sustainability. As men-\ntioned previously, companies increasingly are being held account-\nable not only for their own operations, but also for the operations of \nother members of their global value chains.\nSources: 2022, More than a flooring company, Shaw Inc.

Typically, companies use a rich mix of different \ncompetitive strategies to pursue above-average returns when competing in a particular industry. \nAn industry’s structural characteristics influence a firm’s choice of strategies.99\nCompared with the general environment, the industry environment (measured primarily in \nthe form of its characteristics) has a more direct effect on the competitive actions and responses a \nfirm takes to succeed.100 To study an industry, the firm examines five forces that affect the ability of \nall firms to operate profitably within a given industry.101 Shown in Figure 2.2, the five forces are the \nthreats posed by new entrants, the power of suppliers, the power of buyers, product substitutes, and \nthe intensity of rivalry among competitors.\nThe five forces of competition model depicted in Figure 2.2 expands the scope of a firm’s com-\npetitive analysis. Historically, when studying the competitive environment, firms concentrated on \ncompanies with which they directly competed. However, firms must search more broadly to rec-\nognize current and potential competitors by identifying potential customers as well as the firms \nserving them. For example, the communications industry is now broadly defined as encompassing \nmedia companies, telecoms, entertainment companies, and companies producing devices such as \nsmartphones. In such an environment, firms must study many other industries to identify compa-\nnies with capabilities (especially technology-based capabilities) that might be the foundation for \nproducing a good or a service that can compete against what they are producing.\nLearning Objective \n2-5 Identify the five \ncompetitive forces \nand explain how they \ndetermine an industry’s \nprofitability potential. \nAn industry is a group of \nfirms producing products that \nare close substitutes.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

For example, \nseveral firms have integrated forward in the pharmaceutical industry by acquiring distributors or \nwholesalers. In addition, firms choosing to enter a new market and those producing products that \nare adequate substitutes for existing products can become a company’s competitors.\nNext, we examine the five forces the firm needs to analyze in order to understand the profitabil-\nity potential within an industry (or a segment of an industry) in which it competes or may choose \nto compete.\n2-5a Threat of New Entrants\nIdentifying new entrants is important because they can threaten the market share of existing \ncompetitors.102 One reason new entrants pose such a threat is that they bring additional produc-\ntion capacity. Unless the demand for a good or service is increasing, additional capacity holds \nconsumers’ costs down, resulting in less revenue and lower returns for competing firms. Often, \nnew entrants have a keen interest in gaining a large market share. As a result, new competitors \nmay force existing firms to be more efficient and to learn how to compete in new dimensions (e.g., \nusing an Internet-based distribution channel).\nThe likelihood that firms will enter an industry is a function of two factors: barriers to entry \nand the retaliation expected from current industry participants. Entry barriers make it difficult for \nnew firms to enter an industry and often place them at a competitive disadvantage even when they \nare able to enter. As such, high entry barriers tend to increase the returns for existing firms in the \nindustry and may allow some firms to dominate the industry.103 Thus, firms competing success-\nfully in an industry want to maintain high entry barriers to discourage potential competitors from \ndeciding to enter the industry. \nBarriers to Entry\nFirms competing in an industry (and especially those earning above-average returns) try to \ndevelop entry barriers to thwart potential competitors. In general, more is known about entry \nbarriers (with respect to how they are developed as well as paths firms can pursue to overcome \nthem) in industrialized countries such as those in North America and Western Europe. In contrast, \nrelatively little is known about barriers to entry in rapidly emerging markets such as China. \nThere are different kinds of barriers to entering a market to consider when examining an indus-\ntry environment. Companies competing within a particular industry study these barriers to deter-\nmine the degree to which their competitive position reduces the likelihood of new competitors \nbeing able to enter the industry to compete against them.

Next, we discuss several significant entry barriers that may \ndiscourage competitors from entering a market and that may facilitate a firm’s ability to remain \ncompetitive in a market in which it currently competes.\nEconomies of Scale Economies of scale are derived from incremental efficiency improvements \nthrough experience as a firm grows larger. Therefore, the cost of producing each unit declines as the \nquantity of a product produced during a given period increases. A new entrant is unlikely to quickly \ngenerate the level of demand for its product that in turn would allow it to develop economies of scale.\nEconomies of scale can be developed in most business functions, such as marketing, manu-\nfacturing, research and development, and purchasing.104 Firms sometimes form strategic alliances \nwith other companies to gain scale economies. One type of strategic alliance is a joint venture, in \nwhich two or more firms own part of a company they have formed to achieve a particular strategic \npurpose; in this case, the purpose is to create economies of scale. Other firms simply acquire rivals \nin order to build economies of scale in their operations and to increase their market share as well.\nProduct Differentiation Over time, customers may come to believe that a firm’s product is \nunique. This belief can result from the firm’s service to the customer, effective advertising cam-\npaigns, or being the first to market a good or service.105 Greater levels of perceived product unique-\nness create customers who consistently purchase a firm’s products. To combat the perception of \nuniqueness, new entrants frequently offer products at lower prices. This decision, however, may \nresult in lower profits or even losses.\nThe Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo have established strong brands in the markets in which \nthey compete, and these companies compete against each other in countries throughout the world. \nBecause each of these competitors has allocated a significant amount of resources over many \ndecades to build its brands, customer loyalty is strong for each firm. When considering entry into \nthe soft drink market, a potential entrant would be well advised to pause and determine actions it \nwould take to try to overcome the brand image and consumer loyalty each of these giants possesses.\nCapital Requirements Competing in a new industry requires a firm to have resources to \ninvest. In addition to physical facilities, capital is needed for inventories, marketing activities, and \nother critical business functions. Even when a new industry is attractive, the capital required for \nsuccessful market entry may not be available to pursue the market opportunity.106 For example, \ndefense industries are difficult to enter because of the substantial resource investments required to \nbe competitive. In addition, because of the high knowledge requirements of the defense industry, \na firm might acquire an existing company as a means of entering this industry, but it must have \naccess to the capital necessary to do this.\nSwitching Costs Switching costs are the one-time costs customers incur when they buy from \na different supplier. The costs of buying new ancillary equipment and of retraining employees, \nand even the psychological costs of ending a relationship, may be incurred in switching to a new \nsupplier. In some cases, switching costs are low, such as when the consumer switches to a different \nbrand of soft drink. Switching costs can vary as a function of time, as shown by the fact that in \nterms of credit hours toward graduation, the cost to a student to transfer from one university to \nanother as a freshman is much lower than it is when the student is entering their senior year.\nOccasionally, a decision made by manufacturers to produce a new, innovative product creates \nhigh switching costs for customers. Customer loyalty programs, such as airlines’ frequent flyer \nmiles, are intended to increase the customer’s switching costs. If switching costs are high, a new \nentrant must offer either a substantially lower price or a much better product to attract buyers. \nUsually, the more established the relationships between parties, the greater the switching costs.\nAccess to Distribution Channels Over time, industry participants commonly learn how to \neffectively distribute their products. Access to distribution channels can be a strong entry barrier \nfor new entrants, particularly in consumer nondurable goods industries (e.g., in grocery stores \nwhere shelf space is limited) and in international markets.107 New entrants have to persuade dis-\ntributors to carry their products, either in addition to or in place of those currently distributed. \nPrice breaks and cooperative advertising allowances may be used for this purpose; however, those \npractices reduce the new entrant’s profit potential. Of course, access to distribution channels is less \nof a barrier for products that can be sold on the Internet.\nCost Disadvantages Independent of Scale Sometimes, established competitors have cost \nadvantages that new entrants cannot duplicate. Proprietary product technology, favorable access to \nraw materials, desirable locations, and government subsidies are examples. Successful competition \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.\n\nPart 1: Strategic Management Inputs\n46\nrequires new entrants to reduce the strategic relevance of these factors. For example, delivering \npurchases directly to the buyer can counter the advantage of a desirable location; new food estab-\nlishments in an undesirable location often follow this practice. Business model innovations like this \nmay be the key to survival and success in current retail industries.108\nGovernment Policy Through their decisions about issues such as the granting of licenses \nand permits, governments can also control entry into an industry. Liquor retailing, radio and TV \nbroadcasting, and banking are examples of industries in which government decisions and actions \naffect entry possibilities. Also, governments often restrict entry into some industries because of the \nneed to provide quality service or the desire to protect jobs. It is not uncommon for governments \nto attempt to regulate the entry of foreign firms, especially in industries considered critical to the \ncountry’s economy or important markets within it.109\nGovernmental decisions and policies regarding antitrust issues also affect entry barriers. For \nexample, in the United States, the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department or the Federal Trade \nCommission (FTC) will sometimes disallow a proposed merger because officials conclude that \napproving it would create a firm that is too dominant in an industry and would thus create unfair \ncompetition. In one such case, the FTC sued to block Lockheed Martin, a major defense contractor, \nfrom buying Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, claiming that the purchase would harm rival defense \ncontractors and lead to too much industry consolidation in an industry that is vital to national \ndefense.110\nExpected Retaliation Companies seeking to enter an industry also anticipate the reactions of \nfirms in the industry. An expectation of swift and vigorous competitive responses reduces the like-\nlihood of entry. Vigorous retaliation can be expected when the existing firm has a major stake in the \nindustry (e.g., it has fixed assets with few, if any, alternative uses), when it has substantial resources, \nand when industry growth is slow or constrained.111 For example, any firm attempting to enter the \nairline industry can expect significant retaliation from existing competitors due to overcapacity.\nLocating market niches not being served by incumbents allows the new entrant to avoid entry \nbarriers. Small entrepreneurial firms are generally best suited for identifying and serving neglected \nmarket segments. When Honda first entered the U.S. motorcycle market, it concentrated on \nsmall-engine motorcycles, a market that firms such as Harley-Davidson ignored. By targeting this \nneglected niche, Honda initially avoided a significant amount of head-to-head competition with \nwell-established competitors. After consolidating its position, Honda used its strength to attack \nrivals by introducing larger motorcycles and competing in the broader market.\n2-5b Bargaining Power of Suppliers\nIncreasing prices and reducing the quality of their products are potential means suppliers use to \nexert power over firms competing within an industry. If a firm is unable to recover cost increases by \nits suppliers through its own pricing structure, its profitability is reduced by its suppliers’ actions.112 \nA supplier group is powerful when:\n\t\n●\nIt is dominated by a few large companies and is more concentrated than the industry to which \nit sells.\n\t\n●\nSatisfactory substitute products are not available to industry firms.\n\t\n●\nIndustry firms are not a significant customer for the supplier group.\n\t\n●\nSuppliers’ goods are critical to buyers’ marketplace success.\n\t\n●\nThe effectiveness of suppliers’ products has created high switching costs for industry firms.\n\t\n●\nIt poses a credible threat to integrate forward into the buyers’ industry. Credibility is enhanced \nwhen suppliers have substantial resources and provide a highly differentiated product.113\nSome buyers attempt to manage or reduce suppliers’ power by developing a long-term rela-\ntionship with them. Although long-term arrangements reduce buyer power, they also increase the \nsuppliers’ incentive to be helpful and cooperative in appreciation of the longer-term relationship \n(guaranteed sales). This is especially true when the partners develop trust in one another.114\n2-5c \nBargaining Power of Buyers\nFirms seek to maximize the return on their invested capital. Alternatively, buyers (customers of an \nindustry or a firm) want to buy products at the lowest possible price—the point at which the indus-\ntry earns the lowest acceptable rate of return on its invested capital. To reduce their costs, buyers \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

For example, as a sugar substitute, \nNutraSweet (and other sugar substitutes) places an upper limit on sugar manufacturers’ prices—\nNutraSweet and sugar perform the same function, though with different characteristics.\nNewspaper firms have experienced significant circulation declines over the past 20 years. The \ndeclines are a result of the ready availability of substitute outlets for news including Internet sources \nand cable television news channels, along with email and cell phone alerts. Likewise, satellite TV \nand cable and telecommunication companies provide substitute services for basic media services \nsuch as television, Internet, and phone. The many electronic devices that provide services overlap-\nping with the personal computer (e.g., laptops) such as tablets, smartphones, smart watches, etc., \nhave changed markets for PCs, with multiple niches in the market.\nIn general, product substitutes present a strong threat to a firm when customers face few if any \nswitching costs and when the substitute product’s price is lower or its quality and performance \ncapabilities are equal to or greater than those of the competing product. Interestingly, some firms \nthat produce substitutes have begun forming brand alliances, which research shows can be effective \nwhen the two products are of relatively equal quality. If there is a differential in quality, the firm \nwith the higher quality product will obtain lower returns from such an alliance.117 Differentiating a \nproduct along dimensions that are valuable to customers (such as quality, service after the sale, and \nlocation) reduces a substitute’s attractiveness.\n2-5e Intensity of Rivalry among Competitors\nBecause an industry’s firms are mutually dependent, actions taken by one company usually invite \nresponses. Competitive rivalry intensifies when a firm is challenged by a competitor’s actions or \nwhen a company recognizes an opportunity to improve its market position.118\nFirms within industries are rarely homogeneous; they differ in resources and capabilities and \nseek to differentiate themselves from competitors. Typically, firms seek to differentiate their prod-\nucts from competitors’ offerings in ways that customers value and in which the firms have a com-\npetitive advantage. Common dimensions on which rivalry is based include price, service after the \nsale, and innovation. More recently, firms have begun to act quickly (speed a new product to the \nmarket) in order to gain a competitive advantage.119\nNext, we discuss the most prominent factors that experience shows affect the intensity of rival-\nries among firms.\nNumerous or Equally Balanced Competitors \nIntense rivalries are common in industries with many companies. With multiple competitors, it \nis common for a few firms to believe they can act without eliciting a response. However, evidence \nThe Internet has given consumers the ability to access news with just \nthe click of a button. This substitute news outlet has made it almost \nimpossible for newspapers to compete.\nKaspars Grinvalds/Shutterstock.com\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

At the other extreme, industries with only a few firms of equivalent size and power also \ntend to have strong rivalries. The large and often similar-sized resource bases of these firms permit \nvigorous actions and responses. The competitive battles between Airbus and Boeing and between \nCoca-Cola and PepsiCo exemplify intense rivalry between relatively equal competitors.\nSlow Industry Growth \nWhen a market is growing, firms try to effectively use resources to serve an expanding customer \nbase. Markets increasing in size reduce the pressure to take customers from competitors. However, \nrivalry in no-growth or slow-growth markets becomes more intense as firms battle to increase their \nmarket shares by attracting competitors’ customers. Certainly, this has been the case in the fast-\nfood industry. McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King use their resources, capabilities, and core \ncompetencies to try to win each other’s customers. The instability in the market that results from \nthese competitive engagements may reduce the profitability for all firms engaging in such battles.\nHigh Fixed Costs or High Storage Costs \nWhen fixed costs account for a large part of total costs, as in the airline industry and many man-\nufacturing industries, companies try to maximize the use of their productive capacity. Doing \nso allows the firm to spread costs across a larger volume of output. However, when many firms \nattempt to maximize their productive capacity, excess capacity is created on an industry-wide \nbasis. To then reduce inventories, individual companies typically cut the price of their product and \noffer rebates and other special discounts to customers. Doing this often intensifies competition. \nThe pattern of excess capacity at the industry level followed by intense rivalry at the firm level \nis frequently observed in industries with high storage costs. Perishable products, for example, lose \ntheir value rapidly with the passage of time. As their inventories grow, producers of perishable \ngoods often use discount pricing strategies to sell products quickly.\nLack of Differentiation or Low Switching Costs \nWhen buyers find a differentiated product that satisfies their needs, they frequently purchase the \nproduct loyally over time. Industries with many companies that have successfully differentiated \ntheir products have less rivalry, resulting in lower competition for individual firms. Firms that \ndevelop and sustain a differentiated product that cannot be easily imitated by competitors often \nearn higher returns. However, when buyers view products as commodities (i.e., as products with \nfew differentiated features or capabilities), rivalry intensifies. In these instances, buyers’ purchasing \ndecisions are based primarily on price and, to a lesser degree, service. \nPersonal computers are a commodity product, and the cost to switch from a computer manu-\nfactured by one firm to another is low. Thus, the rivalry among Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Lenovo \nis strong as these companies consistently seek to find ways to differentiate their offerings. On the \nother hand, Apple computer products have many features that make it harder to switch to the \nproducts of other manufacturers. This is one reason why Apple is able to charge higher prices for \nits personal computers.\nHigh Strategic Stakes \nCompetitive rivalry is likely to be high when it is important for several of the competitors to \nperform well in the market. Competing in diverse businesses (such as petrochemicals, fashion, \nmedicine, and plant construction, among others), Samsung is a formidable foe for Apple in the \nglobal smartphone market. Samsung has committed a significant amount of resources to develop \ninnovative products as the foundation for its efforts to try to outperform Apple in selling this par-\nticular product. Because this market is extremely important to both firms, the smartphone rivalry \nbetween them (and others) will likely remain quite intense.\nHigh Exit Barriers \nSometimes companies continue competing in an industry even though the returns on their \ninvested capital are low or even negative. Firms making this choice likely face high exit barriers, \nwhich include economic, strategic, and emotional factors, causing them to remain in an industry \nwhen the profitability of doing so is questionable.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.\n\nChapter 2: The External Environment: Opportunities, Threats, Industry Competition, and Competitor Analysis\n49\nCommon exit barriers that firms face include the following:\n\t\n●\nSpecialized assets (assets with values linked to a business or location),\n\t\n●\nFixed costs of exit (such as labor agreements),\n\t\n●\nStrategic interrelationships (relationships of mutual dependence, such as those between one \nbusiness and other parts of a company’s operations, including shared facilities and access to \nfinancial markets).\n\t\n●\nEmotional barriers (aversion to economically justified business decisions because of fear for \none’s own career, loyalty to employees, and so forth), and\n\t\n●\nGovernment and social restrictions (often based on government concerns for job losses and \nregional economic effects; more common outside the United States).\nExit barriers are especially high in the airline industry. Fortunately, revenues increased fol-\nlowing the global pandemic, but even when things were at their worst in this industry none of the \nmajor carriers dropped out. Industry consolidation has been a factor for many years, as the airlines \nhave pursued efficiency enhancements through economies of scale and service to more locations \nthrough combining routes and acquisitions.120\n2-5f \nInterpreting Industry Analyses\nEffective industry analyses are products of careful study and interpretation of data and information \nfrom multiple sources. A wealth of industry-specific data is available for firms to analyze to better \nunderstand an industry’s competitive realities. Because of globalization, international markets \nand rivalries must be included in the firm’s analyses. And, because of the development of global \nmarkets, a country’s borders no longer restrict industry structures. In fact, in general, entering \ninternational markets enhances the chances of success for new ventures as well as more established \nfirms.121 \nAnalysis of the five forces within a given industry allows the firm to determine the industry’s \nattractiveness in terms of the potential to earn average or above-average returns. In general, the \nstronger the competitive forces, the lower the potential for firms to generate profits by implement-\ning their strategies. An unattractive industry has low entry barriers, suppliers and buyers with \nstrong bargaining positions, strong competitive threats from product substitutes, and intense \nrivalry among competitors. These industry characteristics make it difficult for firms to achieve \nstrategic competitiveness and earn above-average returns. Alternatively, an attractive industry has \nhigh entry barriers, suppliers and buyers with little bargaining power, few competitive threats from \nproduct substitutes, and relatively moderate rivalry.122\nNext, we explain strategic groups as an aspect of industry competition.\n2-6 Strategic Groups and Their Influence\nA set of firms emphasizing similar strategic dimensions and using a similar strategy is called a \nstrategic group.123 Shaw Industries, featured earlier in this chapter, is a part of a strategic group of \nflooring manufactures, most of which are also located in Georgia in the United States. The com-\npetition between firms within a strategic group is greater than the competition between a member \nof a strategic group and companies outside that strategic group. Therefore, intra-strategic group \ncompetition is more intense than is inter-strategic group competition. The performance leaders \nwithin groups can follow strategies similar to those of other firms in the group and yet main-\ntain strategic distinctiveness through differentiating their products as a foundation for earning \nabove-average returns.124 The extent of technological leadership, product quality, pricing policies, \ndistribution channels, and customer service are examples of strategic dimensions that firms in a \nstrategic group may treat similarly.\nThe notion of strategic groups can be useful for analyzing an industry’s competitive structure. \nSuch analyses can be helpful in diagnosing competition, positioning, and the profitability of firms \ncompeting within an industry. High mobility barriers, high rivalry, and low resources among the \nfirms within an industry limit the formation of strategic groups.125 However, after strategic groups \nare formed, their membership tends to remain relatively stable over time. Using strategic groups \nto understand an industry’s competitive structure requires the firm to plot companies’ competitive \nLearning Objective \n2-6 Define strategic \ngroups and describe their \ninfluence on firms.\nA set of firms emphasizing \nsimilar strategic dimensions \nand using a similar strategy is \ncalled a strategic group.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This type of analysis shows the firm how certain companies are \ncompeting similarly in terms of how they use similar strategic dimensions.\nStrategic groups have several implications. First, because firms within a group offer similar \nproducts to the same customers, the competitive rivalry among them can be intense. The more \nintense the rivalry, the greater the threat to each firm’s profitability. Second, the strengths of the \nfive forces differ across strategic groups. Third, the closer the strategic groups are in terms of their \nstrategies, the greater is the likelihood of rivalry between the groups.\nTraditional department store retailers are having real problems. Former stalwarts such as Sears, \nMacy’s, and J.C. Penney are all struggling, largely because they ignored competition and it even-\ntually caught up to them. Discount stores such as Walmart and Target eroded their market share \nas they offered more and higher quality merchandise that was traditionally bought at the more \nupscale department stores, but the current problem revolves primarily around the formidable \nAmazon. Amazon has been winning competitive battles against these weakened retailers, and even \nagainst Alphabet (Google) and Walmart. The lesson here is that even highly successful firms must \ncontinuously analyze and understand their competitors if they are to maintain their market leading \npositions. If Amazon continues to effectively analyze its competition across industries, the question \nbecomes, can any of its rivals beat it?126\n2-7 Competitor Analysis\nThe competitor environment is the final part of the external environment requiring study. \nCompetitor analysis focuses on each company against which a firm competes directly. The Coca-\nCola Company and PepsiCo, Home Depot and Lowe’s, Carrefour SA and Tesco PLC, and Amazon \nand Alphabet (Google) are examples of competitors that are keenly interested in understanding \neach other’s objectives, strategies, assumptions, and capabilities. Indeed, intense rivalry creates a \nstrong need to understand competitors.127 In a competitor analysis, the firm seeks to understand \nthe following:\n\t\n●\nWhat drives the competitor, as shown by its future objectives.\n\t\n●\nWhat the competitor is doing and can do, as revealed by its current strategy.\n\t\n●\nWhat the competitor believes about the industry, as shown by its assumptions.\n\t\n●\nWhat the competitor’s capabilities are, as shown by its strengths and weaknesses.128\nKnowledge about these four dimensions helps the firm prepare an anticipated response profile \nfor each competitor (see Figure 2.3). The results of an effective competitor analysis help a firm \nunderstand, interpret, and predict its competitors’ actions and responses. Understanding compet-\nitors’ actions and responses clearly contributes to the firm’s ability to compete successfully within \nthe industry.129 Research suggests that executives often fail to analyze competitors’ possible reac-\ntions to competitive actions their firm takes, placing their firm at a potential competitive disadvan-\ntage as a result.130 The Strategic Focus on the evolution of the global automobile industry illustrates \na very high level of competition among major automobile manufacturers, driven by their strategies \nand what they are trying to accomplish. It also shows how faulty assumptions about an industry can \nlead to a loss of competitive advantage. \nCritical to an effective competitor analysis is gathering information that can help the firm \nunderstand its competitors’ intentions and the strategic implications resulting from them.131 Useful \ndata and information combine to form competitor intelligence, which is the set of data and infor-\nmation the firm gathers to better understand and anticipate competitors’ objectives, strategies, \nassumptions, and capabilities. In competitor analysis, the firm gathers intelligence not only about \nits competitors, but also regarding public policies in countries around the world. Such intelligence \nfacilitates an understanding of the strategic posture of foreign competitors. Through effective com-\npetitive and public policy intelligence, the firm gains the insights needed to make effective strategic \ndecisions regarding how to compete against rivals.\nWhen asked to describe competitive intelligence, phrases such as “competitive spying” and \n“corporate espionage” come to mind for some. These phrases underscore the fact that competitive \nintelligence appears to involve trade-offs.132 The reason is that “what is ethical in one country is \ndifferent from what is ethical in other countries.” This position implies that the rules of engagement \nLearning Objective\n2-7 Describe what firms \nneed to know about their \ncompetitors and different \nmethods used to collect \nintelligence about them. \nCompetitor intelligence \nis the set of data and \ninformation the firm gathers \nto better understand and \nanticipate competitors’ \nobjectives, strategies, \nassumptions, and capabilities.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Ford, General Motors, \nand Chrysler were building large, flashy cars, and competition \nwas based on who was the flashiest. Then, a 1973 oil embargo \nby members of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries) led to gasoline shortages and increased prices that \nshifted consumer attention to efficiency. Fuel-efficient automo-\nbiles produced by Japanese companies Honda and Toyota, which \nwere already gaining popularity in the United States and around \nthe world, were in high demand. Consumers were also learning \nthat many automobiles manufactured by non-U.S. companies \nwere of higher quality. \nIt took literally decades for American automobile manufacturers \nto learn how to compete head-to-head in quality and efficiency with \nforeign competitors. The only real advantages American auto manu-\nfacturers had in the U.S. market were that some consumers were loyal \nto American brands and the U.S. government imposed high tariffs on \nimports. However, the tariff advantage was lost when Honda, Toyota, \nand other manufacturers started building many of their automobiles \nin the United States. \nMeanwhile, German-based automakers Volkswagen, Daimler \n(Mercedes), and BMW, as well as Korean auto manufacturer Hyundai, \ncontinued to grow worldwide. SAIC Motor, a Chinese state-owned \nautomobile company, also became an important player in the \nglobal auto industry, although most of its cars are purchased within \nChina. Competitive forces have driven a lot of consolidation in the \nindustry, as companies have combined to increase market power \nand provide a wider selection of brands to consumers. For exam-\nple, Fiat Chrysler and French PSA Group merged to become the \nninth-largest auto manufacturer in the world. As a prime example \nof consolidation, Volkswagen now owns 10 brands, including Audi, \nPorsche, and Seat.\nIf we fast forward to 2021, the five largest auto manufacturers \nby revenue are, in this order, Volkswagen, Toyota, Daimler, Ford, \nand General Motors. The global auto industry looks quite differ-\nent than it did 50 years ago. With advances in electrical storage \ntechnology and a societal focus on the environment, everyone in \nthe industry is rushing to market with electric vehicles and hybrid \nvehicles that run on gasoline and batteries. Tesla, a pioneer in \nelectric car technology, is the most valuable carmaker worldwide \nwith a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion in early 2022. \nLegacy automakers are playing catchup with Tesla after watching \nthe company grow for more than a decade. This late response is \nreminiscent of the days when U.S. automakers refused to switch \nfrom big gas-guzzling cars to slimmer, more efficient cars 40 years \nago. Perhaps they did not learn their lesson about assessing and \nresponding to major technological and societal environmental \nchanges. With all the emphasis on the environment and global \nclimate change, wasn’t it obvious that electric vehicles would be \nthe wave of the future?\nAnother interesting development in this industry is the race to \nprovide charging stations for electric vehicles. Companies are adding \nthousands of charging stations in the United States and around the \nworld. Most of these companies are start-ups, and it is still unclear how \nprofitable these ventures will be. Clearly, a company that provides  \ncharging stations is complementary to auto manufacturers who want \nto sell electric vehicles. Tesla does both, and the U.S. government has \nexpressed an interest in building a national network. With all the \nuncertainty, the competitive dynamics of this nascent (developing) \nindustry are yet to be determined.\nLooking even further into the future, technological advances are \nmaking it possible to develop prototypes of a completely autono-\nmous self-driving car. These types of automobiles have the poten-\ntial to create fundamental changes in the way people and goods \nare transported. Many manufacturers are already offering features \nin their automobiles that keep them in the middle of driving lanes, \nadjust their speeds based on surrounding traffic, and apply the brakes \nbefore an impact. Although many hurdles (i.e., safety issues) need \nto be overcome before cars will be completely autonomous, many \nexperts believe their future existence is certain.\nSources: D.

Complementors can be an import-\nant part of a business ecosystem. A business ecosystem is a complex network of interconnected \norganizations—suppliers, customers, government agencies, technology suppliers, financiers, and \nother stakeholders—whose competitive and cooperative efforts are associated with the satisfaction \nof a particular value proposition (e.g., product or service).137\nThere are many examples of firms whose goods or services complement other companies’ \nofferings. For example, the services of the airlines and hotels are complementary. In the Strategy \nin Focus, we learned that electric car manufacturers and suppliers of electric charging stations are \ncomplementors; however, this changes when an electric car company also supplies charging sta-\ntions. Intel and Microsoft are perhaps the most widely recognized complementors. The two firms \ntypically do not directly buy from or sell to each other, but their products are highly complementary.\nAlliances among airline companies such as Oneworld and Star involve member companies \nsharing their route structures and customer loyalty programs as a means of complementing each \nother’s operations. (Alliances and other cooperative strategies are described in Chapter 9.) In this \nexample, each of the two alliances is a network of complementors. American Airlines, British Air-\nways, Finnair, Japan Airlines, and Fiji Airways are among the airlines forming the Oneworld alli-\nance. Air Canada, Air China, Air New Zealand, Lufthansa, and United Airlines are five of the \nmembers forming the Star alliance. Both alliances constantly adjust their members and services \noffered to better meet customers’ needs.\nFuture Objectives\n•  How do our goals compare with our\n   competitors’ goals?\n•  Where will emphasis be placed in the\n   future?\n•  What is the attitude toward risk?\nCurrent Strategy\n•  How are we currently competing?\n•  Does our strategy support changes\n   in the competitive structure?\nAssumptions\n•  Do we assume the future will be volatile?\n•  Are we operating under a status quo?\n•  What assumptions do our competitors \n   hold about the industry and themselves?\nCapabilities\n•  What are our strengths and weaknesses?\n•  How do we rate compared to our \n   competitors?\nResponse\n•  What will our competitors do in the\n   future?\n•  Where do we hold an advantage over \n   our competitors?\n•  How will this change our relationship\n   with our competitors?\nFigure 2.3 Competitor Analysis Components\nComplementors are \ncompanies or networks \nof companies that sell \ncomplementary goods or \nservices that are compatible \nwith the focal firm’s goods or \nservices.\nA business ecosystem \nis a complex network \nof interconnected \norganizations—suppliers, \ncustomers, government \nagencies, technology \nsuppliers, financiers, and \nother stakeholders—whose \ncompetitive and cooperative \nefforts are associated with \nthe satisfaction of a particular \nvalue proposition (e.g., \nproduct or service).\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.\n\nChapter 2: The External Environment: Opportunities, Threats, Industry Competition, and Competitor Analysis\n53\nAs our discussion shows, complementors expand the set of competitors that firms must eval-\nuate when completing a competitor analysis. In this sense, American Airlines and United Air-\nlines examine each other both as direct competitors on multiple routes but also as complementors \nthat are members of different alliances (Oneworld for American and Star for United). In all cases \nthough, ethical commitments and actions should be the foundation on which competitor analyses \nare developed.\n2-7a Ethical Considerations\nFirms must follow relevant laws and regulations as well as carefully articulated ethical guidelines \nwhen gathering competitor intelligence. Industry associations often develop lists of these practices \nthat firms can adopt. Practices considered both legal and ethical include:\n1. Obtaining publicly available information (e.g., court records, competitors’ help-wanted adver-\ntisements, annual reports, financial reports of publicly held corporations, and Uniform Com-\nmercial Code filings), and\n2. Attending trade fairs and shows to obtain competitors’ brochures, view their exhibits, and \nlisten to discussions about their products.\nIn contrast, certain practices (including blackmail, trespassing, eavesdropping, and stealing \ndrawings, samples, or documents) are widely viewed as unethical and often are illegal as well.\nSome competitive intelligence practices may be legal, but a firm must decide whether they are \nalso ethical, given the image it desires as a corporate citizen. Especially with electronic transmis-\nsions, the line between legal and ethical practices can be difficult to determine. For example, a firm \nmay develop website addresses that are like those of its competitors and thus occasionally receive \nemail transmissions that were intended for those competitors. The practice is an example of the \nchallenges companies face in deciding how to gather intelligence about competitors while simulta-\nneously determining how to prevent competitors from learning too much about them. To deal with \nthese challenges, firms should establish principles and take actions that are consistent with them.\nProfessional associations are available to firms as sources of information regarding competitive \nintelligence practices. For example, while pursuing its mission to help firms make “better decisions \nthrough competitive intelligence,” the Strategy and Competitive Intelligence Professionals associ-\nation offers codes of professional practice and ethics to firms for their possible use when deciding \nhow to gather competitive intelligence.138\nOpen discussions of intelligence-gathering techniques can help a firm ensure that employees, \ncustomers, suppliers, and even potential competitors understand its convictions to follow ethical \npractices when gathering intelligence about its competitors. An appropriate guideline for competi-\ntor intelligence practices is to respect the principles of common morality and the right of competi-\ntors not to reveal certain information about their products, operations, and intentions. \nInformation gathered through industry, competitor, and complementor analysis, as well as the \ninformation gathered through analyzing the general environment, should be well organized, evalu-\nated and fed back to the managers that can use it to make good strategic decisions. The information \ntechnologies described in Chapter 1 are essential in making this happen.\nSummary\n \n● The firm’s external environment is challenging and \ncomplex. Because of its effect on performance, firms \nmust develop the skills required to identify opportu-\nnities and threats that are a part of their external envi-\nronment.\n \n● The external environment has three major parts:\n1. The general environment (segments and elements \nin the broader society that affect industries and the \nfirms competing in them),\n2. The industry environment (factors that influence a \nfirm, its competitive actions and responses, and the \nindustry’s profitability potential), and\n3. The competitor environment (in which the firm \nanalyzes each major competitor’s future objectives, \ncurrent strategies, assumptions, and capabilities).\n \n● Scanning, monitoring, forecasting, and assessing are \nthe four parts of the external environmental analysis \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Effectively using this process helps the firm in \nits efforts to identify opportunities and threats.\n \n● The general environment has seven segments: demo-\ngraphic, economic, political/legal, sociocultural, tech-\nnological, global, and sustainable physical. For each \nsegment, firms have to determine the strategic rele-\nvance of environmental changes and trends.\n \n● Compared with the general environment, the industry \nenvironment has a more direct effect on firms’ com-\npetitive actions and responses. The five forces model \nof competition includes the threat of entry, the power \nof suppliers, the power of buyers, product substitutes, \nand the intensity of rivalry among competitors. By \nstudying these forces, a firm can identify a position \nin an industry where it can influence the forces in its \nfavor or where it can buffer itself from the power of \nthe forces in order to achieve strategic competitive-\nness and earn above-average returns.\n \n● Industries are populated with different strategic \ngroups. A strategic group is a collection of firms fol-\nlowing similar strategies along similar dimensions. \nCompetitive rivalry is greater within a strategic group \nthan between strategic groups.\n \n● Competitor analysis informs the firm about the future \nobjectives, current strategies, assumptions, and capabili-\nties of the companies with which it competes directly. A \nthorough competitor analysis examines complementors \nthat support forming and implementing rivals’ strategies.\n \n● Different techniques are used to create competitor \nintelligence: the set of data, information, and knowl-\nedge that allow the firm to better understand its com-\npetitors and thereby predict their likely competitive \nactions and responses. Firms should use only legal and \nethical practices to gather intelligence. The Internet \nenhances firms’ ability to gather insights about com-\npetitors and their strategic intentions.\nKey Terms\nbusiness ecosystem 52\ncompetitor analysis 33\ncompetitor intelligence 50\ncomplementors 52\ndemographic segment 36\neconomic environment 38\ngeneral environment 33\nglobal segment 41\nindustry 43\nindustry environment 33\nopportunity 34\npolitical/legal segment 39\nsociocultural segment 39\nstrategic group 49\nsustainable physical environment segment 42\nthreat 34\ntechnological segment 40\nReview Questions \n1.

After Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market in 2017, \nInstacart’s business expanded rapidly, as retailers were look-\ning for ways to expand their online sales. The COVID-19 \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

Instacart’s sales increased 330 percent from 2019 to \n2020, with transactions volume quadrupling during the year. \nThe company began delivering items other than groceries, \nand picked up customers like Best Buy and Dick’s Sporting \nGoods. Before the pandemic, Instacart’s online grocery deliv-\nery share was 20 percent. In 2020, the company enjoyed a \n40 percent market share. With more than 750 retailers as \ncustomers, Instacart also raised $600 million from investors. \nHowever, as is always the case in an industry with explo-\nsive growth, many new competitors entered the delivery mar-\nket. In fact, online grocery and delivery apps were able to raise \nover $25 billion in venture capital in 2021. One new compet-\nitor, Gopuff, delivers goods through its own fulfillment cen-\nters. DoorDash introduced what it calls DashMarts, delivering \nboth convenience and food items from its own stores. In one \nsuch location in New York City, DoorDash can deliver locally \nin 10 to 15 minutes. Other delivery services in New York alone \ninclude Fridge No More, Gorillas, Buyk, and JOKR. As a \nresult of increasing competition and a cooldown in pandemic- \nrelated growth, Instacart’s sales grew by only 15 percent in 2021. \nIn response to slowing sales growth and new competi-\ntion, Instacart approached DoorDash to discuss a merger, but \ncould not arrive at a deal. A deal with Uber was also sought, \nwith no success. In addition to these attempts at a major deal, \nInstacart bought a company that makes automated shopping \ncarts and another that provides catering software. In house, \na new “Instacart Platform” was launched that includes ware-\nhouses, advertising, and in-store services. The company also \nannounced that it was going to cut delivery times to 30 min-\nutes for major retailers such as Kroger. In spite of these bold \nmoves, the company still had to cut its valuation by about \n38 percent in early 2022, citing difficulties associated with \ncompeting in the delivery market. Instacart also lost its CEO \nCarolyn Everson, a former Meta Platforms employee, only \nfour months after replacing founder Apporva Metha in the \nposition.\nMeanwhile, Walmart is going to make it even tougher for \ndelivery service companies like Instacart. “The retail giant is \nfocused on adding new ways to offer shoppers home deliv-\nery and efficiently move online inventory as the pandemic- \nrelated-e-commerce surge shows signs of cooling.” As of early \n2022, third-party companies like DoorDash were making a \nlot of Walmart’s home deliveries, and delivery service was \navailable at more than 3,400 of its stores. Among other things, \nWalmart is experimenting with using its own workers to make \nhome deliveries and expanding a service in which workers \nleave packages inside the homes of customers. Walmart is also \nexploring the use of autonomous delivery vehicles.\nIn addition, drone delivery is becoming a reality. In 2022, \nWing (an Alphabet subsidiary) launched a drone delivery \nsystem in the Dallas–Fort Worth area. This one is different \nbecause Wing’s largest customer, Walgreens Boots Alliance, \nis operating the system. Walgreens is giving customers 100 \nitems to choose from, including popular over-the-counter \nmedicines and a few household items. Wing also has a drone \ndelivery service for other customers, including Blue Bell \nCreameries, in Frisco, Texas.\nIn the future, Instacart plans to expand its enterprise tech-\nnology business by providing infrastructure and online tools \nfor grocery store customers and developing “smart” shop-\nping carts, as well as store checkouts and fulfillment centers. \nWill these strategic moves be enough to cope with changes in \nInstacart’s environment and increasing competition?\nSources: S.

However, as mentioned in Chapter 1, big \ndata and big data analytics are becoming increasingly popular in business. In the \ncurrent competitive landscape, most businesses must be innovative, and using big \ndata analytics to interpret data retrieved from all stakeholder channels (mobile, Web, \nemail, and physical stores) throughout the supply chain can help them become more \ninnovative.\nThis is the situation for large pharmaceutical companies like Merck, Pfizer, \nRoche, and Johnson & Johnson. Prior to the global pandemic, many large pharma-\nceutical companies were struggling to be innovative, often putting more of an em-\nphasis on marketing than the creation of new drugs. They were earning mediocre \nreturns of about 3 percent return on investment (ROI), down from 10 percent a de-\ncade earlier. In fact, a Gallup poll found that consumers ranked the pharmaceuticals \nindustry last among \ntwo dozen industries \nin favorability.\nPerhaps in re-\nsponse to slow sales \nand poor levels of \ninnovation, many \npharmaceutical \ncompanies had been \nworking to develop \na core competence \nin big data analyt-\nics even before the \npandemic hit. In \naddition to lacklus-\nter innovation, they \nwere and are ramp-\ning up their big data \nanalytics compe-\ntencies because of \nvast increases in the \namounts of data that \nmust be studied and interpreted to remain competitive, in part because of changes \nin the health-care delivery landscape and health-care reform. \nThe global pandemic demonstrated some of the many benefits that can accrue to \npharmaceutical firms that develop big data analytics as a core competence. Develop-\ning vaccines to fight COVID-19 required analysis of huge amounts of data in a short \namount of time, which some believe has fundamentally changed the way pharma-\nceutical firms will function in the future. For example, big data analytics help a firm \nquickly identify trial candidates and accelerate their recruitment, develop improved \ninclusion and exclusion criteria to use in clinical trials, and uncover unintended uses \nand indications for products. Also, some firms—Pfizer in particular—reaped both \nenormous sales gains and increased cash flows due to new vaccine sales that allowed \nthem to step up their investments in information technologies that can lead to higher \nperformance in the future. \nIn developing their big data analytics capabilities, many of the big pharma com-\npanies are also investing in artificial intelligence (AI). AI provides the capability to \nanalyze many different sets of information. For example, AI can help analyze data on \nclinical trials, health records, genetic profiles, and preclinical studies. AI can analyze \nand integrate these data to identify patterns and suggest hypotheses about relation-\nships. A new drug generally requires a decade of research and $2.6 billion of invest-\nment. And only about 5 percent of the drugs that enter experimental research make \nit to the market and are successful. Eventually, it is expected that the use of AI could \nreduce the early part of research development time from four to six years to one year, \nnot only greatly reducing the time of development but also the costs.\n© anilakkus / Getty Images\nsolarseven/Shutterstock.com\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

There are several capabilities big pharma companies need for big data analysis to be a \ncore competence. Supportive architecture, the proper mix of data scientists, and “technology \nthat integrates and manages new types and sources of data flexibility and scalability while \nmaintaining the highest standards of data governance, data quality, and data security” are \nexamples of capabilities that pharmaceutical companies need if they wish to develop a core \ncompetence in this area. \nBig data analytics capabilities are likely to be a necessity for pharmaceutical firms to \nsucceed in the future, and firms that develop a genuine competence in this area will have an \nadvantage over competitors. In fact, this very competitive industry is likely to become even \nmore competitive on a global scale. Most Chinese pharmaceutical firms are medium-sized \nand sell generic drugs and therapeutic medicines, investing in research and development \n(R&D) at only about 25 percent of the amount invested by big pharma in developed  \ncountries. However, China has a plan to develop large, competitive pharmaceutical firms. \nChina also has a goal to become the world leader in AI, which can facilitate the creation  \nof these firms.\nThus, big pharma executives feel pressure, especially with the initial costs of developing big \ndata analytics and AI. Hopefully, investments in these areas will lead to reduced costs and high-\ner rates of success in the development of new drugs. Until then, however, analysts are predict-\ning more mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry, with big pharmaceutical \ncompanies acquiring successful medium-sized pharmaceuticals and biotechnology firms.

Increasingly, innovation appears to be a vital path to \nefforts to develop competitive advantages, particularly sustainable ones.1 This means that many \nfirms seek to develop innovation as a core competence. In Chapter 1, we defined core competencies \nas capabilities that serve as a source of competitive advantage for a firm over its rivals. We discuss \ncore competencies in this chapter and explain how firms use their resources and capabilities to \nform them. Organizations achieve strategic competitiveness and earn above-average returns by \nacquiring, bundling, and leveraging their resources for the purpose of taking advantage of oppor-\ntunities in the external environment in ways that create value for customers.2 As the Opening Case \ndemonstrates, many pharmaceutical firms are attempting to use new technologies such as big \ndata analytics and AI to better leverage their existing resources in order to achieve a competitive \nadvantage.\nEven if a firm develops and manages resources in ways that create core competencies and com-\npetitive advantages, competitors will eventually learn how to duplicate the benefits of the firm’s \nvalue-creating strategy; thus, all competitive advantages have a limited life.3 Because of this, the \nquestion of duplication of a competitive advantage is not if it will happen, but when. In general, a \ncompetitive advantage’s sustainability is a function of three factors:\n1. The rate of core competence obsolescence because of environmental changes,\n2. The availability of substitutes for the core competence, and\n3. The imitability of the core competence.4\nLearning Objective\n3-1 Explain why a firm \nneeds to study and \nunderstand its internal \norganization.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Only when firms are able to do this can they expect to achieve strategic com-\npetitiveness, earn above-average returns, and remain ahead of competitors over the long term. As \nwell-known strategy scholar Clayton Christensen noted, “successful strategists need to cultivate a \ndeep understanding of the processes of competition and progress and of the factors that undergird \neach advantage. Only thus will they be able to observe when old advantages are poised to disappear \nand how new advantages can be built in their stead.”5\nWe studied the general, industry, and competitor environments in Chapter 2. Armed with \nknowledge about the realities and conditions of their external environment, firms have a better \nunderstanding of marketplace opportunities and the characteristics of the competitive environ-\nment in which those opportunities exist. In this chapter, we focus on the firm. By analyzing its \ninternal organization, a firm determines what it can do. Matching what a firm can do (a function \nof its resources, capabilities, and core competencies in its internal organization) with what it \nmight do (a function of opportunities and threats in the external environment) yields insights for \nthe firm to select strategies from among those we discuss in Chapters 4 through 9.\nWe begin this chapter by briefly describing conditions associated with analyzing the firm’s \ninternal organization. We then discuss the roles of resources and capabilities in developing core \ncompetencies, which are the sources of the firm’s competitive advantages. Included in this discus-\nsion are the techniques firms use to identify and evaluate resources and capabilities and the criteria \nfor identifying core competencies from among them. \nResources alone typically do not provide competitive advantages. Instead, resources create \nvalue when the firm uses them to form capabilities, some of which become core competencies, and \nhopefully sources of competitive advantage. Because of the relationship among resources, capabil-\nities, and core competencies, we also discuss the value chain and examine four criteria that firms \nuse to determine if their capabilities are core competencies and, as such, sources of competitive  \nadvantage.6 The chapter closes with comments about outsourcing as well as the need for firms to \nprevent their core competencies from becoming core rigidities. The existence of core rigidities \nindicates that the firm is too anchored to its past, a situation that prevents it from continuously \ndeveloping new capabilities and core competencies.\n3-1a Why Understand the Internal Organization \nOne of the conditions associated with analyzing a firm’s internal organization is the reality that \nin today’s global economy, some of the resources that were traditionally critical to firms’ efforts \nto produce, sell, and distribute their goods or services—such as labor costs, access to financial \nresources and raw materials, and protected or regulated markets—although still important, are \nnow less likely to be sources of competitive advantage.7 \nGiven the increasing importance of the global economy, those analyzing their firm’s inter-\nnal organization should adopt a global mind-set, which is the ability to analyze, understand, \nand manage an internal organization in ways that are not dependent on the assumptions of a \nsingle country, culture, or context.8 Because they are able to span artificial boundaries, those \nwith a global mind-set recognize that their firms must possess resources and capabilities that \nallow understanding of and appropriate responses to competitive situations that are influ-\nenced by country-specific factors and unique cultures. Using a global mind-set to analyze the \ninternal organization has the potential to significantly help the firm in its efforts to outper-\nform rivals.9\nFinally, analyzing the firm’s internal organization requires that evaluators examine the firm’s \nentire portfolio of resources and capabilities. This perspective suggests that individual firms \npossess at least some resources and capabilities that other companies do not—at least not in the \nsame combination. Resources are the source of capabilities, some of which lead to the develop-\nment of core competencies; in turn, some core competencies may lead to a competitive advan-\ntage for the firm.10 Understanding how to leverage the firm’s unique bundle of resources and \ncapabilities is a key outcome decision makers seek when analyzing the internal organization.11 \nFigure 3.1 illustrates the relationships among resources, capabilities, core competencies, and \ncompetitive advantages, and shows how their integrated use can lead to strategic competitive-\nness. As we discuss next, firms use the resources in their internal organization to create value \nfor customers.\nA global mind-set is the \nability to analyze, understand, \nand manage an internal \norganization in ways that \nare not dependent on the \nassumptions of a single \ncountry, culture, or context.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Firms create value by innovatively bundling and leverag-\ning their resources to form capabilities and core competencies.13 Firms with a competitive advan-\ntage create more value for customers than do competitors. Walmart uses its “every day low price” \napproach to doing business (an approach that is grounded in the firm’s core competencies, such as \ninformation technology and distribution channels) to create value for those seeking to buy prod-\nucts at a low price compared to competitors’ prices for those products. The stronger these firms’ \ncore competencies, the greater the amount of value they’re able to create for their customers.14 \nUltimately, creating more value for customers is the source of above-average returns for a firm.\nMaking decisions involving the firm’s assets—identifying, developing, deploying, and protect-\ning resources, capabilities, and core competencies—may appear to be relatively easy. However, the \nstrategic decisions managers make about the internal organization are nonroutine, have ethical \nimplications, and significantly influence the firm’s ability to earn above-average returns.15 These \ndecisions involve choices about the resources the firm needs to collect and how to best manage and \nleverage them. Also, while making these decisions they must be simultaneously aware of changes \nin the firm’s external environment.16 Moreover, the task is increasingly internationalized.17 Some \nbelieve that too much pressure on managers to make only decisions that help the firm meet antici-\npated quarterly earnings makes it difficult to accurately examine the firm’s internal organization.18\nThe challenges of making effective decisions are implied by preliminary evidence suggesting that \none-half of organizational decisions fail.19 Sometimes, mistakes are made as the firm analyzes condi-\ntions in its internal organization.20 Managers might, for example, think a capability is a core compe-\ntence when it is not. That is, they may believe it has the capacity to lead to long-term competitiveness, \nbut such is not the case. American automobile manufacturers, discussed in Chapter 2, believed that \ntheir competencies in building large, comfortable cars would sustain them over the long term; how-\never, the market shifted to smaller, fuel efficient cars and U.S. manufacturers were slow to respond. \nA firm can improve by studying its mistakes; in fact, the learning generated by making and cor-\nrecting mistakes can be important in the creation of new capabilities and core competencies.21 One \ncapability that can be learned from failure is when to quit. For example, News Corp.’s Amplify unit \n(founded 2011) was created to change the way children are taught. As of mid-2015, the firm had invested \nover $1 billion in the unit, which makes tablets, sells online curricula, and offers testing services.  \nLearning Objective\n3-2 Define value and \ndiscuss its importance.\nCore\nCompetencies\nDiscovering\nCore\nCompetencies\n•  Outsource\nCapabilities\nResources\n•  Tangible\n•  Intangible\nCompetitive\nAdvantage\nStrategic\nCompeti-\ntiveness\nFour Criteria\nof Sustainable\nAdvantages\nValue\nChain\nAnalysis\n•  Valuable\n•  Rare\n•  Costly to Imitate\n•  Nonsubstitutable\nFigure 3.1 Components of an Internal Analysis\nValue is measured by a \nproduct’s performance \ncharacteristics and by \nits attributes for which \ncustomers are willing to pay.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In September 2015, News \nCorp. decided to sell Amplify to a team of managers and private investors, incurring a significant \nloss.22 News Corp. could have saved a significant amount of money if they had dropped this oper-\nation many years previously.\nUncertainty, complexity, and intraorganizational conflict affect managers as they analyze the inter-\nnal organization and make decisions about resources (refer to Figure 3.2). Environmental uncertainty \nincreases the complexity and range of issues to examine when studying the internal environment.23 \nManagers face uncertainty due to such things as new proprietary technologies, rapidly changing eco-\nnomic and political trends, transformations in societal values, and shifts in customers’ demands.24 \nConsider how uncertainty affects the ways resources are used at coal companies such as Peabody \nEnergy Corp. and Murray Energy Corp. Coal. These companies have been suffering in the last decade \nor more with significant regulations and competition from cleaner forms of energy such as natural \ngas. They were aided some by the reduction of regulations by the Trump administration, but the Biden \nadministration reversed a lot of what Trump did, and the competition from cleaner and cheaper forms \nof energy remains. Thus, their environment is both highly complex (many factors to consider) and \nuncertain. Biases regarding how to cope with complexity and uncertainty can affect decisions made \nabout how to manage the firm’s resources and capabilities to form core competencies.25\nAdditionally, intraorganizational conflict may surface when decisions are made about the core \ncompetencies a firm should develop and nurture. Conflict might surface in the energy companies \nmentioned above about the degree to which resources and capabilities should be used to form new \ncore competencies to support newer “clean technologies.”\nIn making decisions affected by these three conditions, judgment is required. Judgment is the \ncapability of making successful decisions when no obviously correct model or rule is available or \nwhen relevant data are unreliable or incomplete. In such situations, decision makers must be aware \nof possible cognitive biases, such as overconfidence. Individuals who are too confident in the deci-\nsions they make about how to use the firm’s resources may fail to fully evaluate contingencies that \ncould affect those decisions.26\nWhen exercising judgment, decision makers often take intelligent risks. In the current competitive \nlandscape, executive judgment can become a valuable capability. Effective judgment demonstrated \nby decision makers allows a firm to build a strong reputation and retain the loyalty of stakeholders \nwhose support is linked to above-average returns.27 Discussed fully in Chapter 12, strategic leaders \ncan be thought of as individuals with an ability to examine the firm’s resources, capabilities, and core  \ncompetencies and make effective choices about their use and development.\nNext, we consider the relationships among a firm’s resources, capabilities, and core compe-\ntencies. While reading these sections, keep in mind that organizations have more resources than \ncapabilities and more capabilities than core competencies.\n3-3 Resources, Tangible and Intangible \nResources, capabilities, and core competencies are the foundation of competitive advantage. \nResources are bundled to create organizational capabilities. In turn, capabilities are the source of \na firm’s core competencies, which are the basis of establishing competitive advantages.28 We intro-\nduced these relationships in Figure 3.1 and discuss them next.\nLearning Objective\n3-3 Describe the \ndifferences between \ntangible and intangible \nresources.\nConditions\nUncertainty\nUncertainty exists about the characteristics of \nthe firm’s general and industry environments and \ncustomers’ needs.\nComplexity\nComplexity results from the interrelationships \namong conditions shaping a firm.\nIntraorganizational Conflicts\nIntraorganizational conflicts may exist among \nmanagers making decisions as well as among \nthose affected by the decisions.\nFigure 3.2 Conditions Affecting Managerial Decisions about Resources, Capabilities, and Core Competencies\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

By themselves, resources do not allow firms to create value for customers as the foundation \nfor earning above-average returns. Instead, resources are used and combined to form capabilities.29 \nFor example, Subway, the fast-food sandwich chain, links its fresh ingredients with several other \nresources, including the continuous training it provides to those running its restaurants, as the foun-\ndation for customer service as a capability—customer service is also a core competence for Subway.\nThe Internet is a resource for Amazon.com. The firm uses the Internet to sell goods at prices \nthat typically are lower than those offered by competitors selling the same goods through more \ncostly brick-and-mortar storefronts. By combining other resources (such as access to a wide \nproduct inventory and a fast delivery system), Amazon has developed a reputation for excellent  \ncustomer service. Amazon’s capability in terms of customer service is a core competence as well, in \nthat the firm creates unique value for customers through the services it provides to them.\nSome of a firm’s resources are tangible while others are intangible. Tangible resources are assets \nthat can be observed and quantified. Production equipment, manufacturing facilities, distribu-\ntion centers, and formal reporting structures are examples of tangible resources. For energy giant \nKinder Morgan, its stock of oil and gas pipelines are a key tangible resource. Intangible resources \nare assets that are rooted deeply in the firm’s history, accumulate over time, and are relatively \ndifficult for competitors to analyze and imitate. Because they are embedded in unique patterns of \nroutines, intangible resources are difficult for competitors to analyze and imitate. Knowledge, trust \nbetween managers and employees, managerial capabilities, organizational routines (the unique \nways people work together), scientific capabilities, the capacity for innovation, brand name, the \nfirm’s reputation for its goods or services and how it interacts with stakeholders (such as employ-\nees, customers, and suppliers), and organizational culture are intangible resources.30\nIntangible resources require nurturing to maintain their ability to help firms engage in compet-\nitive battles. For example, brand names have long been a valuable intangible resource for companies \nlike Coca-Cola, Nike, and Disney. These companies are very protective of their brands, and they \nmake sure that all of their products and advertising reflect the appropriate brand image. Similarly, \nresearch and development processes at companies like the big chip makers Intel and TSMC (Taiwan \nSemiconductor Manufacturing Company) are carefully nurtured. As the Strategic Focus demon-\nstrates, Harley-Davidson (Harley) has a well-protected competence in its premium brand and also in \nits stakeholder relationships, especially with customers, that fortifies its brand image among motor-\ncycle riders. However, the company is not as popular with the rising generation of riders, so the ques-\ntion is whether these competencies are enough to provide competitiveness for Harley in the future.\nThe Harley-Davidson example demonstrates that intangible resources such as a strong brand \nname or relationships with customers may be even more important in the development of core \ncompetencies than tangible resources. Internal analysis can help a firm determine which resources \nare important to future success. For each analysis, tangible and intangible resources are grouped \ninto categories. The four primary categories of tangible resources are financial, organizational, \nphysical, and technological (refer to Table 3.1). The three primary categories of intangible resources \nare human, innovation, and reputational (refer to Table 3.2).\nTable 3.1 Tangible Resources\nFinancial Resources\n \n●\nThe firm’s capacity to borrow\n \n●\nThe firm’s ability to generate funds through internal operations\nOrganizational Resources\n \n●\nFormal reporting structures\nPhysical Resources\n \n●\nThe sophistication of a firm’s plant and equipment and the at-\ntractiveness of its location\n \n●\nDistribution facilities\n \n●\nProduct inventory\nTechnological Resources\n \n●\nAvailability of technology-related resources such as copyrights, \npatents, trademarks, and trade secrets\nSources: Adapted from J.

Because Harley’s motorcycles \nwere used by the military in both the first and second world wars, \ntheir leadership position was solidified. However, new Japanese play-\ners entered the U.S. motorcycle industry in the 1960s, threatening this \nposition. Harley asked the U.S. government to increase import tariffs \nfor Japanese motorcycles, and the government complied. However, \neventually these tariffs were removed. \nHarley experienced ups and downs after that; however, the com-\npany developed a loyal cult following through developing close \nrelationships with customers and associating the Harley brand with \nadventure and the thrill of riding. Both of these core competencies, \nbrand identity and close relationships with customers, are exemplified \nin this statement by Harley management: “A chill sweeps through your \nbody, created by a spontaneous outburst of pure, unadulterated joy. \nYou are surrounded by people from all walks of life and every corner of \nthe globe. They are complete strangers, but you know them like your \nown family. They were drawn to this place by the same passion— \nthe same dream. And they came here on the same machine. This is \none place you can truly be yourself. Because you don’t just fit in. You \nbelong.”\nLoyal customers and a strong brand name have sustained \nHarley though the tough times. Also, toward the end of the last \ncentury, Harley established a larger presence in Canada, Europe, \nthe Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. However, \nHarley’s fortunes internationally have varied widely. For example, \nin 2019 Harley sold less than 2,500 motorcycles in India, causing \nthe company to partner with the large Indian distributor Hero \nMotoCorp to help with marketing and sales in that country. Harley \nalso diversified into electric motorcycles a few years ago; how-\never, the price tag of almost $30,000 discouraged many potential \nconsumers. \nLooking ahead, one of the primary questions with regard to the \nfuture performance of Harley is whether the company can gener-\nate the same sort of loyalty in a new generation of riders that it has \nenjoyed for so many years with what is now an aging consumer base. \nBasically, is the Harley brand going to remain a core competence? \nThis question remains unanswered, and Harley sales of motorcycles \n(in units) declined each year from 2017 to 2020. \nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Harley fared better in \n2021 than in previous years, as people were anxious to get outside \nrather than being isolated. Retail motorcycle sales grew by 8 per-\ncent in North America, which is Harley’s biggest market, although \nthey declined in other regions of the world. Gina Goetter, chief \nfinancial officer, told Barron’s that Harley’s factories were running \nat full capacity, and the company was looking for ways to increase \nproduction.\nIs the uptick in sales a sign of the future or is it a temporary bump? \nIn an effort to increase its appeal to the new generation of riders \nand strengthen its international position, in 2020 Harley appointed \nJochen Zeitz, a European environmental activist, as its CEO. Under his \nleadership, the company is making a huge new investment in elec-\ntric motorcycles. To raise funds, Harley spun off its LiveWire electric \nmotorcycle business into a separate publicly traded company late in \n2021. The deal was estimated to raise more than $500 million, to be \nused for product development and to grow LiveWire’s manufacturing \nand distribution capabilities. The deal left Harley with a 74 percent \nownership stake in the new company. Harley CEO Jochen Zeitz said \nthat the capital infusion and independence will allow LiveWire to act \nlike a start-up. Can Harley gain the same sort of brand recognition and \nloyalty with a new generation that it has enjoyed with older riders for \nso many years? \nSources: S.

For exam-\nple, an airplane is a tangible resource, but “you can’t use the same airplane on five different routes \nat the same time. You can’t put the same crew on five different routes at the same time. And the \nsame goes for the financial investment you’ve made in the airplane.”32\nIntangible Resources\nCompared to tangible resources, intangible resources are a superior source of capabilities and, \nsubsequently, core competencies.33 In fact, in the global economy, a firm’s intellectual capital often \nplays a more critical role in corporate success than do physical assets.34 Because of this, being able \nto effectively manage intellectual capital is an increasingly important skill for today’s leaders to \ndevelop.35\nBecause intangible resources are less visible and more difficult for competitors to understand, \npurchase, imitate, or substitute for, firms prefer to rely on them rather than on tangible resources \nas the foundation for their capabilities. In fact, the more unobservable (i.e., intangible) a resource \nis, the more valuable that resource is in the creation of capabilities.36 Another benefit of intangible \nresources is that, unlike most tangible resources, their use \ncan be leveraged. For instance, sharing knowledge among \nemployees does not diminish its value for any one person. \nTo the contrary, two people sharing their individualized \nknowledge sets often can be leveraged to create additional \nknowledge that, although new to each individual, contrib-\nutes potentially to performance improvements for the firm.\nReputational resources (refer to Table 3.2), as demon-\nstrated in the Harley-Davidson example, can be important \nsources of a firm’s capabilities and core competencies.37 \nEarned through the firm’s actions as well as its words, a \nvalue-creating reputation is a product of years of superior \nmarketplace competence as perceived by stakeholders.38 \nA reputation indicates the level of awareness a firm has \nbeen able to develop among stakeholders and the degree to \nwhich they hold the firm in high esteem.39\nTaking advantage of today’s technologies, many firms \nare using social media as a means of influencing their rep-\nutations.40 Recognizing that thousands of conversations \noccur daily throughout the world and that what is being \nTable 3.2 Intangible Resources\nHuman Resources\n \n●\nKnowledge\n \n●\nTrust\n \n●\nSkills\n \n●\nAbilities to collaborate with others\nInnovation Resources\n \n●\nIdeas\n \n●\nScientific capabilities\n \n●\nCapacity to innovate\nReputational Resources\n \n●\nBrand name\n \n●\nPerceptions of product quality, durability, and reliability\n \n●\nPositive reputation with stakeholders such as suppliers and customers\nSources: Adapted from R.

Being transparent and \nprotecting consumers’ privacy are examples of the commitments the firm has established.41\n3-4 Capabilities and Core Competencies\nA firm combines individual tangible and intangible resources to create capabilities.42 In turn, capa-\nbilities are used to complete the organizational tasks required to produce, distribute, and service \nthe goods or services the firm provides to customers. As a foundation for building core compe-\ntencies and hopefully competitive advantages, capabilities are often based on developing, carrying, \nand exchanging information and knowledge through the firm’s human capital.43 Strategic human \ncapital allows a firm to develop capabilities through matching the knowledge, skills, and abilities \nof their employees to particular strategic objectives. Simply having highly skilled and knowledge-\nable people in the firm is not enough. For example, a firm may have employees who possess multi-\ncultural knowledge, skills, and abilities, but unless they are put in a position in which they can use \nthose attributes in helping the firm with its international strategies and operations, they will not \nhelp a multinational firm achieve higher performance.44 \nAs illustrated in Table 3.3, capabilities are often developed in specific functional areas (such \nas manufacturing, R&D, and marketing) or in a part of a functional area (e.g., advertising). Table 3.3  \npresents a grouping of organizational functions and the capabilities that some companies are \nthought to possess in terms of all or parts of those functions.\n3-4a Core Competencies\nDefined in Chapter 1, core competencies are capabilities that serve as a source of competitive advan-\ntage for a firm over its rivals. Core competencies distinguish a company competitively and reflect \nits personality. Core competencies emerge over time through an organizational process of accu-\nmulating and learning how to deploy different resources and capabilities.45 As the capacity to take \naction, core competencies are the “crown jewels of a company,” the activities the company performs \nLearning Objective\n3-4 Define capabilities \nand discuss their \ndevelopment.\nStrategic human capital \nallows a firm to develop \ncapabilities through matching \nthe knowledge, skills, and \nabilities of their employees to \nparticular strategic objectives.\nTable 3.3 Example of Firms’ Capabilities\nFunctional Areas\nCapabilities\nExamples of Firms\nDistribution\n \n●\nEffective use of logistics management techniques\n \n●\nWalmart\nHuman Resources\n \n●\nMotivating, empowering, and retaining employees\n \n●\nMicrosoft\nManagement Information \nSystems\n \n●\nEffective and efficient control of inventories through point-\nof-purchase data collection methods\n \n●\nWalmart\nMarketing\n \n●\nEffective promotion of brand-name products\n \n●\nEffective customer service\n \n●\nInnovative merchandising\n \n●\nProcter & Gamble\n \n●\nRalph Lauren Corp.\n \n●\nMcKinsey & Co.\n \n●\nCrate & Barrel\nManagement\n \n●\nAbility to envision the future of clothing\n \n●\nHugo Boss\n \n●\nZara\nManufacturing\n \n●\nDesign and production skills yielding reliable products\n \n●\nProduct and design quality\n \n●\nMiniaturization of components and products\n \n●\nKomatsu\n \n●\nWitt Gas Technology\n \n●\nSony\nResearch & Development\n \n●\nInnovative technology\n \n●\nDevelopment of sophisticated elevator control solutions\n \n●\nRapid transformation of technology into new products and \nprocesses\n \n●\nDigital technology\n \n●\nCaterpillar\n \n●\nOtis Elevator Co.\n \n●\nChaparral Steel\n \n●\nThomson Consumer Electronics\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

As a capability, R&D activities are the source of \nthis core competence. More specifically, the way Apple has combined some of its tangible (e.g., \nfinancial resources and research laboratories) and intangible (e.g., scientists and engineers and \norganizational routines) resources to complete research and development tasks creates a capability \nin R&D. By emphasizing its R&D capability, Apple can innovate in ways that create unique value \nfor customers in the form of the products it sells.\nExcellent customer service in its retail stores is another of Apple’s core competencies. In this \ninstance, unique and contemporary store designs (a tangible resource) are combined with knowl-\nedgeable and skilled employees (an intangible resource) to provide superior service to customers. \nA number of carefully developed training and development procedures are capabilities on which \nApple’s core competence of excellent customer service is based. The procedures that are capabili-\nties include specification of how employees are to interact with customers, carefully written train-\ning manuals to describe on-site tech support that is to be provided to customers, and deep thinking \nabout every aspect of the store’s design, including music that is played. Apple has a special training \nprogram designed to build associates’ knowledge of Apple products and how to sell them.47\n3-4b Building Core Competencies\nTwo tools help firms identify their core competencies. The first consists of four specific criteria of \nsustainable competitive advantage that can be used to determine which capabilities are core compe-\ntencies. Because the capabilities presented in Table 3.3 have satisfied these four criteria, they are core \ncompetencies. The second tool is value chain analysis. Firms use this tool to select the value-creating \ncompetencies that should be maintained, upgraded, or developed and those that should be outsourced.\n3-5 The Four Criteria of Sustainable  \nCompetitive Advantage\nCapabilities that are valuable, rare, costly to imitate, and nonsubstitutable are core competencies \n(refer to Table 3.4). In turn, core competencies help firms to gain competitive advantages over \ntheir rivals. Capabilities failing to satisfy the four criteria are not core competencies, meaning \nthat although every core competence is a capability, not every capability is a core competence. In \nslightly different words, for a capability to be a core competence, it must be valuable and unique \nfrom a customer’s point of view. For a core competence to be a potential source of competitive \nadvantage, it must be inimitable and nonsubstitutable by competitors.48\nA sustainable competitive advantage exists only when competitors are unable to duplicate the \nbenefits of a firm’s strategy or when they lack the resources to attempt imitation.49 For some period \nof time, the firm may have a core competence by using capabilities that are valuable and rare, but \neasy to imitate.

The company was created as a result of the \npassion of the founder for the outdoors. Yvon got his start in climbing \nin 1953 in Southern California. He met and began climbing with some \nother young climbers who were members of the Sierra Club, an envi-\nronmental group. In 1957, he taught himself to blacksmith and began \nmaking pitons, the spikes climbers use to scale sheer rock walls. \nWord of the pitons spread, and he eventually began selling them for \n$1.50 each from the back of his car. In 1965, Yvon formed Chouinard \nEquipment with a partner, Tom Frost. They redesigned almost every \nclimbing tool to improve strength, weight, and functionality. By 1970, \nChouinard Equipment was the largest supplier of climbing hardware \nin the United States. However, Yvon and Tom became concerned that \ntheir gear was defacing the rock, so they decided to minimize their \npiton business. They also introduced aluminum “chocks” that could be \nwedged into cracks by hand without hammering them into the rock. \nDemand for their chocks quickly outstripped supply.\nIn 1970, on a winter climbing trip to Scotland, Yvon bought a \nrugby shirt. The shirt performed very well for climbing because of \nits ruggedness. Back in the United States, Yvon’s climbing friends \nwanted to know where to get one. This experience eventually led to \nthe creation of a clothing line, which the company called Patagonia. \nThe clothing featured specialized fabrics that performed much better \nthan competing products. Also, at a time when most outdoor clothes \nwere in dull colors, the company decided to drench its product with \nvivid colors such as teal, seafoam, and French red. The company grew \nrapidly—at one time listed on Inc. magazine’s list of the fastest grow-\ning privately held companies. The culture at the company is laid back \nand friendly, with employees dressing any way they want, even bare-\nfooted. There are no private offices in the company, which can cause \ndistractions but also stimulates open communication.\nPatagonia was fairly small when they began to engage in efforts \nto save the environment from the perils of global climate change, \ndeforestation, acid rain, polluted rivers, and the rapid loss of ground-\nwater. In one of their first environmental efforts, they showed up at a \ncity council meeting to protest a development that would damage \na popular surfing area. At the meeting, they met a young biology \nstudent, and partnered with him to save a local river. Patagonia then \nbegan making donations to small groups working to protect the nat-\nural habitat. In 1986, the company began donating 10 percent of \nits profits to these types of groups. Later they committed to donat-\ning 1 percent of sales, regardless of whether they made a profit, and \nbegan encouraging others to do so through a group called 1% for \nthe Planet.\nNow headed by Jenna Johnson, an avid rock climber who was \npreviously vice president of technical outdoor for the company, \nPatagonia, Inc., is on the cutting edge of environmentally friendly \nbusiness practices. Many of their raw materials are grown organically \nor produced from recycled materials. The company also works tire-\nlessly to reduce its carbon footprint. In fact, the company’s mission \nstatement is, “We’re in business to save our home planet.” Patagonia \nbecame a Certified B Corporation in 2012, a designation given to \nfirms that have strong records in social and environmental perfor-\nmance. The company is also very politically active. For example, Hans \nCole, Patagonia’s director of environmental campaigns and advo-\ncacy, recently testified to the U.S. House Committee on Natural Parks, \nForests, and Public Lands on the topic of global climate change. The \ncompany also recently launched a “Blue Heart of Europe” campaign \nto protect the Balkan region from the ill effects of thousands of pro-\nposed hydropower projects. In addition, Patagonia makes certain that \nthe companies with which it does business are socially responsible. \nFor example, the company set 2020 as the year by which its suppliers \nin Taiwan would have to ensure that none of the migrant workers \nthey hire will ever have to pay for their jobs.\nPatagonia’s customers know that the company is “green,” and since \nmany of them are outdoor enthusiasts, this image is a core compe-\ntency that fosters loyalty. Because Patagonia is so well known for its \nenvironmentally friendly practices, it would be difficult for most com-\npetitors to do enough to catch up to them in this area.\nSources: J.

Developing a “green” core competence \ncan contribute to the firm’s efforts to earn above-average returns while benefitting the broader \nsociety. Patagonia, featured in the Strategic Focus, is an example of a company that has a “green” \ncore competence that has put them in a favorable position in the outdoor clothing market for  \nmany years.\nThe length of time a firm can expect to create value by using its core competencies is a function \nof how quickly competitors can successfully imitate a good, service, or process. Value-creating \ncore competencies may last for a relatively long period of time only when all four of the criteria we \ndiscuss next are satisfied. Thus, Patagonia has a core competence that gives the company a sustain-\nable competitive advantage because its green strategy and associated brand image satisfy all four of  \nthe criteria.\nValuable\nValuable capabilities allow the firm to exploit opportunities or neutralize threats in its external \nenvironment. By effectively using capabilities to exploit opportunities or neutralize threats, a firm \ncreates value for customers.50 For example, Groupon created the “daily deal” marketing space \nthat connected buyers to sellers through what amounts to deeply discounted online coupons for \nGroupon members. Because it was the first major offering in this space, the firm reached $1 billion \nin revenue faster than any other company in history. Restaurants, hair and nail salons, and hotels \nare examples of the types of companies making frequent use of Groupon’s services. Young, urban \nprofessionals desiring to affordably experience the cities in which they live are the firm’s target \ncustomers.51 \nWhile offering value to customers, the capabilities to offer its services can be imitated and \nGroupon’s initial success invited rivals to enter the market. Competing daily-deal websites such as \nLivingSocial quickly surfaced and offered similar and often less expensive deals. In fact, many com-\npetitors entered the market, to include Yipit, Woot, RetailMeNot, Tanga, and Ebate, in addition to \nLivingSocial.52 Groupon profits declined significantly from net income of $14 million in 2017 to a \nloss of $11 million in 2018. By 2020 the loss was $288 million. Revenues declined from $2.8 billion \nin 2017 to $1.4 billion in 2020.53 \nRare\nRare capabilities are capabilities that few, if any, competitors possess. A key question to be \nanswered when evaluating this criterion is, “how many rival firms possess these valuable capa-\nbilities?” Capabilities possessed by many rivals are unlikely to become core competencies for any \nof the involved firms.54 Instead, valuable but common (i.e., not rare) capabilities are sources of \ncompetitive parity.55 Competitive advantage results only when firms develop and exploit valuable \ncapabilities that become core competencies and that differ from those shared with competitors. \nThe central problem for Groupon is that its capabilities to connect buyers and sellers through daily \ndeals and discounts reached competitive parity quickly.\nCostly to Imitate\nCostly-to-imitate capabilities are capabilities that other firms cannot easily develop. Capabilities \nthat are costly to imitate are created because of one or a combination of three reasons (refer to \nTable 3.4). First, a firm sometimes is able to develop capabilities because of unique historical con-\nditions. As firms evolve, they often acquire or develop capabilities that are unique to them.56 For \nexample, a firm with a unique and valuable organizational culture that emerged in the early stages \nof the company’s history “may have an imperfectly imitable advantage over firms founded in \nanother historical period.”57 Briefly discussed in Chapter 1, organizational culture is a set of values \nthat are shared by members in the organization. An organizational culture is a source of advantage \nwhen employees are held together tightly by their belief in it and the leaders who helped to create \nit.58 Firms like Disney, Google (Alphabet), and Patagonia developed strong cultures under the \nguidance of their founders and those cultures are still paying off today.\nA second condition of being costly to imitate occurs when the link between the firm’s core \ncompetencies and its competitive advantage is causally ambiguous.59 In these instances, competitors \ncan’t clearly understand how a firm uses its capabilities as the foundation for competitive advantage. \nAs a result, firms are uncertain about the capabilities they should develop to duplicate the benefits \nRare capabilities are \ncapabilities that few, if any, \ncompetitors possess.\nCostly-to-imitate \ncapabilities are capabilities \nthat other firms cannot easily \ndevelop.\nValuable capabilities \nallow the firm to exploit \nopportunities or neutralize \nthreats in its external \nenvironment.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This condition \nis evident in the research and development processes of \nlarge companies on the cutting edge of their industries. \nAlthough competitors can imitate the products that \nemerge from these processes, it is hard to figure out pre-\ncisely how the research and development process that \ncreated them combines the firm’s capabilities. Causal \nambiguity is a source of sustainable competitiveness in \nfirms like Intel, Apple, and Google (Alphabet).\nSocial complexity is the third reason that capabilities \ncan be costly to imitate. Social complexity means that \nat least some, and frequently many, of the firm’s capa-\nbilities are the product of complex social phenomena.60 \nInterpersonal relationships, trust, friendships among \nmanagers and between managers and employees, and \na firm’s reputation with suppliers and customers are \nexamples of socially complex capabilities. Southwest \nAirlines is careful to hire people who fit with its culture. \nThis complex interrelationship between the culture and \nhuman capital adds value in ways that other airlines cannot, such as jokes on flights by the flight \nattendants or a high level of cooperation between gate personnel and pilots.\nNonsubstitutable\nNonsubstitutable capabilities are capabilities that do not have strategic equivalents. This final \ncriterion “is that there must be no strategically equivalent valuable resources that are themselves \neither not rare or imitable. Two valuable firm resources (or two bundles of firm resources) are stra-\ntegically equivalent when they each can be separately exploited to implement the same strategies.”61 \nIn general, the strategic value of capabilities increases as they become more difficult to substitute. \nThe more intangible, and hence invisible, capabilities are, the more difficult it is for firms to find \nsubstitutes and the greater the challenge is to competitors trying to imitate a firm’s value-creating \nstrategy. Firm-specific knowledge and trust-based working relationships between managers and \nnonmanagerial personnel, such as has existed for years at firms like Cisco Systems, Salesforce, and \nHilton, are examples of capabilities that are difficult to identify and for which finding a substitute \nis challenging.62\nIn summary, sustainable competitive advantage is only available to firms using valuable, \nrare, costly-to-imitate, and nonsubstitutable capabilities. Table  3.5 presents the competitive \nconsequences and performance implications resulting from combinations of the four criteria \nof sustainability. The analysis suggested by the table helps managers determine the strategic \nvalue of a firm’s capabilities. The firm should not emphasize capabilities that fit the criteria \ndescribed in the first row in the table (i.e., resources and capabilities that are neither valuable \nnor rare and that are imitable and for which strategic substitutes exist). Capabilities yielding \nThe Washington Post/Getty Images\nSouthwest Airlines crew hold puppies that became homeless after \nHurricane Maria damaged the island of Puerto Rico.

Some competitors, such as Coca-Cola vs. PepsiCo or Boeing vs. Airbus, may \nhave capabilities that result in competitive parity, where no firm has a significant advantage \nover the other in any particular capability (although in both cases the two firms have an advan-\ntage over other rivals in their industries). In such cases, the firms will nurture their existing \ncapabilities while simultaneously trying to develop capabilities that can yield either a tempo-\nrary or sustainable competitive advantage.63\n3-6 Value Chain Analysis\nValue chain analysis allows the firm to understand the parts of its operations that create the most \nvalue for customers, and can potentially be sources of competitive advantage or even sustainable \ncompetitive advantage if those operations represent core competencies that cannot be easily imi-\ntated.64 Understanding these issues is important because the firm earns above-average returns only \nwhen the value it creates is greater than the costs incurred to create that value.65\nThe value chain is a template that firms use to analyze their cost positions and to identify the \nmultiple means that can be used to facilitate implementation of their chosen strategies.66 Today’s \ncompetitive landscape demands that firms examine their value chains in a global rather than a \ndomestic-only context.67 In particular, activities associated with supply chains should be studied \nwithin a global context.68\nWe present a model of the value chain in Figure 3.3. As depicted in the model, a firm’s value \nchain is segmented into value chain activities and support functions. Value chain activities are \nactivities or tasks the firm completes in order to produce products and then sell, distribute, and \nservice those products in ways that create value for customers. Support functions include the \nactivities or tasks the firm completes in order to support the work being done to produce, sell, \ndistribute, and service the products the firm is producing. A firm can develop a capability and/\nor a core competence in any of the value chain activities or in any of the support functions. \nFirms establish one or more sources of competitive advantage when they use their unique core \ncompetencies to create unique value for customers in a way that competitors cannot duplicate.69 \nThe activities associated with each part of the value chain are presented in Figure 3.4, while the \nactivities that firms complete when dealing with support functions appear in Figure 3.5. All items \nin both figures should be evaluated relative to competitors’ capabilities and core competencies. To \nbecome a core competence and a source of competitive advantage, a capability must allow the firm \nto either:\n1. Perform an activity in a manner that provides value superior to that provided by competitors, \nor\n2. Perform a value-creating activity that competitors cannot perform.\nLearning Objective\n3-6 Explain how firms \nanalyze value chains \nto determine where \nthey are able to create \nvalue when using their \nresources, capabilities, \nand core competencies.\nValue chain activities \nare activities or tasks the \nfirm completes in order to \nproduce products and then \nsell, distribute, and service \nthose products in ways that \ncreate value for customers.\nSupport functions include \nthe activities or tasks the firm \ncompletes in order to support \nthe work being done to \nproduce, sell, distribute, and \nservice the products the firm \nis producing.\nFigure 3.3 A Model of the Value Chain\nSupport Functions\nCustomer\nValue\nValue Chain Activities\nInformation\nTechnology\nManagement\nHuman\nResources\nManagement\nFinance\nResearch\n&\nDevelopment\nSupply-Chain\nManagement\nOperations\nFollow-Up\nService\nDistribution\nMarketing\n(including\nsales)\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In the best case, managers may discover an activity in which the firm can develop a \ncore competence because there are no other firms in the industry that have done so.\nThus far, the emphasis has been on using the value chain to identify activities in which the \nfirm has a core competence or might develop one. However, value chain analysis can also be used \nto look for deficiencies in the organization that could be holding back the creation of value.70 This \npart of the analysis rests on the assumption that a firm is a value creation system. In a value creation \nsystem, each part of a system depends on other parts of the system to create value.71 If one part of \nthe system is not functioning properly, it can hold back creation of value in the entire system.72\nConsider the following examples that demonstrate how a firm is a value creation system. If \nthe finance function is not working well, essential investments in critical areas such as operations, \nresearch and development, or marketing might be curtailed. Similarly, if supply-chain management \nactivities are weak, operations will not have what it needs to do its part well, and this can both hurt \ndownstream activities such as distribution and marketing, as well as reducing the flow of funds to \nother critical areas because customer demand (and money spent) is reduced. This same pattern is \nevident in relationships among all the activities in the value chain and in the support functions. A \nweak area can hurt the performance of the entire system.\nCreating value for customers by completing activities that are part of the value chain requires \nbuilding strong and productive relationships with stakeholders, which include customers, suppliers, \nand alliance partners.73 When firms have strong positive relationships with stakeholders, they are said \nto have social capital.74 The relationships themselves have value because they lead to transfers of knowl-\nedge as well as access to resources that a firm may not hold internally.75 Trust is required to build social \ncapital, whereby resources such as knowledge are transferred across organizations. Indeed, partners \nmust trust each other to allow their resources to be used in such a way that both parties will benefit over \ntime while neither party will take advantage of the other.76 If a relationship with a particular stakeholder \nis poor, this could be holding back the creation of more value for customers or other stakeholders.\nIn a value creation system, \neach part of a system \ndepends on other parts of \nthe system to create value. If \none part of the system is not \nfunctioning properly, it can \nhold back creation of value in \nthe entire system.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Earlier in the chapter, we noted that identifying and assessing the value of a firm’s \nresources and capabilities requires judgment. Judgment is equally necessary when using value \nchain analysis, because no obviously correct model or rule is universally available to help in the \nprocess. \n3-7 Reasons for Outsourcing\nWhen essential value chain activities or support functions are not competencies, a firm can \nconsider outsourcing those activities. Concerned with how components, finished goods, or \nservices will be obtained, outsourcing is the purchase of a value-creating activity or a support \nfunction activity from an external supplier. Not-for-profit, for-profit, and even government \norganizations actively engage in outsourcing.77 Deciding to outsource to a foreign supplier is \ncommonly called offshoring. Many financial institutions are outsourcing functions that sup-\nport cashless transaction because their IT systems cannot handle these activities efficiently. \nSome governments are outsourcing services to increase the quality and efficiency with which \nthe services are delivered (e.g., U.K. outsourcing some surgeries to French health-care provid-\ners). Outsourcing decisions must be made carefully, considering all of the options. However, \nwhen done effectively, outsourcing can provide access to needed capabilities without having \nto develop them internally.\nFirms engaging in effective outsourcing increase their flexibility, mitigate risks, and reduce \ntheir capital investments.78 Moreover, in some industries virtually all firms seek the value that can \nbe captured through effective outsourcing. However, as is the case with other strategic management \nprocess decisions, careful analysis is required before a firm decides to outsource.79 And firms must \nrecognize that only activities where they cannot create value or where they are at a substantial \ndisadvantage compared to competitors should be outsourced.80 Experience suggests that virtually \nany activity associated with the value chain functions or the support functions may fall into this \ncategory. \nLearning Objective\n3-7 Define outsourcing \nand discuss reasons for \nits use.\nOutsourcing is the purchase \nof a value-creating activity or \na support function activity \nfrom an external supplier.\nCustomer Value\nActivities associated with effectively\nacquring and managing financial\nresources.

In addition, by outsourcing activities in which it lacks \ncompetence, the firm can fully concentrate on those areas in which it has the potential to create value.\nThere are concerns associated with outsourcing.82 Two significant ones are the potential loss in \na firm’s ability to innovate and the loss of jobs within the focal firm. When evaluating the possibility \nof outsourcing, firms should anticipate possible effects on their ability to innovate in the future as \nwell as the impact of losing some of their human capital. On the other hand, firms are sometimes \nable to enhance their own innovation capabilities by studying how the companies to which they’ve \noutsourced complete those activities.83 \n3-8 Competencies, Strengths, Weaknesses,  \nand Strategic Decisions\nBy analyzing the internal organization, firms identify their strengths and weaknesses as reflected \nby their resources, capabilities, and core competencies. If a firm has weak capabilities or does not \nhave core competencies in areas required to achieve a competitive advantage, it must acquire those \nresources and build the needed capabilities and competencies. Or, as noted in the previous section, \nsome firms may decide to outsource a function or activity where it is weak in order to improve its \nability to use its remaining resources to create value. \nIn considering the results of examining the firm’s internal organization, managers should \nunderstand that having a significant quantity of resources and capabilities is not the same as having \nthe “right” resources and capabilities. The “right” resources and capabilities are those with the \npotential to be formed into core competencies as the foundation for creating value for customers \nand developing competitive advantages because of doing so. Interestingly, decision makers some-\ntimes become more focused and productive when seeking to find the right resources and capabili-\nties when the firm’s total set of resources and capabilities is constrained.84\nTools such as outsourcing help the firm focus on its core competencies as the source of its compet-\nitive advantages. However, evidence shows that the value-creating ability of core competencies should \nnever be taken for granted. Moreover, the ability of a core competence to be a permanent competitive \nadvantage can’t be assumed. The reason for these cautions is that all core competencies have the poten-\ntial to become core rigidities, which occur due to overdependence on a particular core competence even \nwhen situations change and the core competence is no longer generating a competitive advantage.85 \nEvents occurring in the firm’s external environment can create conditions through which core compe-\ntencies can become core rigidities, generate inertia (e.g., resistance to change), and stifle innovation.86\nAfter studying its external environment to determine what it might choose to do (as explained in \nChapter 2) and its internal organization to understand what it can do (as explained in this chapter), \nthe firm has the information required to select a business-level strategy that it will use to compete \nagainst rivals. We describe various business-level strategies in the next chapter.\nLearning Objective\n3-8 Discuss the \nimportance of identifying \ninternal strengths and \nweaknesses.\nSummary\n \n● In the current competitive landscape, the most effec-\ntive organizations recognize that strategic competitive-\nness and above-average returns result only when core \ncompetencies (identified by studying the firm’s internal \norganization) are matched with opportunities (deter-\nmined by studying the firm’s external environment).\n \n● No competitive advantage lasts forever. Over time, \nrivals use their own unique resources, capabilities, and \ncore competencies to form different value-creating  \npropositions that duplicate the focal firm’s ability \nto create value for customers. Because competitive \nadvantages are not permanently sustainable, firms \nmust exploit their current advantages while simulta-\nneously using their resources and capabilities to form \nnew advantages that can lead to future competitive \nsuccess.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Production equipment, manufacturing  \nfacilities, distribution centers, and formal reporting  \nstructures are examples of tangible resources. \nIntangible resources are assets that are rooted deeply \nin the firm’s history, accumulate over time, and are rel-\natively difficult for competitors to analyze and imitate. \nBecause intangible resources are less visible and more \ndifficult for competitors to understand, purchase, \nimitate, or substitute for, firms prefer to rely on them \nrather than on tangible resources as the foundation \nfor their capabilities. In fact, the more unobservable \n(i.e., intangible) a resource is, the more valuable that \nresource is in the creation of capabilities.\n \n● A firm combines individual tangible and intangible \nresources to create capabilities. In turn, capabilities are \nused to complete the organizational tasks required to \nproduce, distribute, and service the goods or services \nthe firm provides to customers. Core competencies \nare capabilities that serve as a source of competitive \nadvantage for a firm over its rivals. Competencies \nare activities the company performs especially well \ncompared to competitors and through which the firm \nadds unique value to the goods or services. For exam-\nple, strategic human capital allows a firm to develop \ncapabilities through matching the knowledge, skills, \nand abilities of their employees to particular strategic \nobjectives.\n \n● Effectively managing core competencies requires \ncareful analysis of the firm’s resources (inputs to the \nproduction process) and capabilities (resources that \nhave been purposely integrated to achieve a specific \ntask or set of tasks). The knowledge the firm’s human \ncapital possesses is among the most significant of an \norganization’s capabilities and ultimately provides \nthe base for most competitive advantages. The firm \nmust create an organizational culture that allows \npeople to integrate their individual knowledge with \nthat held by others so that, collectively, the firm has \na significant amount of value-creating organizational \nknowledge.\n \n● Capabilities are a more likely source of core compe-\ntence and subsequently of competitive advantages \nthan are individual resources. How a firm nurtures \nand supports its capabilities to become core com-\npetencies is less visible to rivals, making efforts to \nunderstand and imitate the focal firm’s capabilities \ndifficult.\n \n● Only when a capability is valuable, rare, costly to \nimitate, and nonsubstitutable is it a core competence \nand a source of sustainable competitive advantage. \nOver time, core competencies must be supported, \nbut they cannot be allowed to become core rigidi-\nties. Core competencies are a source of competitive \nadvantage only when they allow the firm to create \nvalue by exploiting opportunities in its external envi-\nronment. When this is no longer possible, the com-\npany shifts its attention to forming other capabilities \nthat satisfy the four criteria of sustainable competi-\ntive advantage.\n \n● Value chain analysis is used to identify and eval-\nuate the competitive potential of resources and \ncapabilities. By studying their skills relative to those \nassociated with value chain activities and support \nfunctions, firms can understand their cost structure \nand identify the activities through which they are \nable to create value. Managers can also use value \nchain analysis to identify which activity area could \nbe holding back the ability of the firm to create \nmore value.\n \n● When the firm cannot create value in either a value \nchain activity or a support function, outsourcing \nis considered. Used commonly in the global econ-\nomy, outsourcing is the purchase of a value-creating \nactivity from an external supplier. The firm should \noutsource only to companies possessing a competi-\ntive advantage in terms of the particular value chain \nactivity or support function under consideration. In \naddition, the firm must continuously verify that it is \nnot outsourcing activities through which it could cre-\nate unique value.\n \n● Examining the internal organization unveils if the firm \nhas a significant quantity of the “right” resources and \ncapabilities. The “right” resources and capabilities are \nthose with the potential to be formed into core com-\npetencies. Decision makers then select strategies the \nfirm can to do acquire or develop those resources and \ncapabilities. \nKey Terms\ncostly-to-imitate capabilities 72\nglobal mind-set 63\nintangible resources 66\nnonsubstitutable capabilities 73\noutsourcing 76\nrare capabilities 72\nstrategic human capital 69\nsupport functions 74\ntangible resources 66\nvaluable capabilities 72\nvalue 64\nvalue chain activities 74\nvalue creation system 75\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Why is it important for a firm to study and under-\nstand its internal organization?\n2. What is value? Why is it critical for the firm to create \nvalue? How does it do so?\n3. What are the differences between tangible and \nintangible resources? Why is it important for decision \nmakers to understand these differences? Are tangible \nresources more valuable for creating capabilities than \nare intangible resources, or is the reverse true? Why?\n4. What are capabilities? How do firms create capabilities?\n5. What four criteria must capabilities satisfy for them to \nbecome core competencies? Why is it important for \nfirms to use these criteria to evaluate their capabili-\nties’ value-creating potential?\n6. What is value chain analysis? What does the firm gain \nby successfully using this tool?\n7. How is a firm a value creation system? Give  \nexamples.\n8. What is outsourcing? Why do firms outsource?\n9. How do firms identify internal strengths and weak-\nnesses? Why is it vital that managers have a clear \nunderstanding of their firm’s strengths and  \nweaknesses?\n10. What are core rigidities? What does it mean to say \nthat each core competence could become a core \nrigidity?\nMini-Case\nHow Publix Leverages Its Resources and Capabilities  \nto Create a Sustainable Competitive Advantage\nHeadquartered in Lakeland, Florida, Publix Super Markets, \nInc., operates supermarkets in Florida, Georgia, North \nCarolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, Wisconsin, and  \nTennessee. In addition to grocery products, dairy, deli,  \nand health-care products, the company also has a pharmacy and  \nsells floral products. Publix manages dairy and deli plants, \nand has a number of distribution centers and manufacturing \nfacilities located within convenient range of most of its super-\nmarkets. With revenue of nearly $45 billion, the company has \n230,000 employees, and continues to grow. \nUnlike other supermarket chains in the United States, \nPublix is employee owned. The company also treats its \nemployees extraordinarily well. In fact, as of 2022, Publix has \nclaimed a place on Fortune magazine’s Best Companies to \nWork For list for 25 straight years. Only four companies have \ndone that. Publix hires young people, identifies the ones with \nthe most talent, and pours money into training employees so \nthat they are genuine experts on products. Employees are not \nunionized, and they don’t need to be, because they are already \ngetting the same sort of compensation and benefits that they \nwould get from a union contract. In one recent example, \nPublix began offering paid parental leave to employees start-\ning in 2022. \nOne thing Publix offers that very few companies can offer \nis a career. People are promoted from within the company. \nMany top managers started as grocery baggers—90 percent \nof current managers started on the supermarket floor. After \na year of employment, employees receive shares of stock in \nPublix that can only be traded within the company. “Just like \na startup where workers are given equity, the model entices \npeople to stay.” This kind of employment pattern is rare in \nretail. Turnover is very high in other retail companies, and \nwas especially a problem during the pandemic. “In December \n2021 some 786,000 retail employees quit—a record in an \nindustry already plagued by high turnover.” In retail, having \na well-trained workforce that stays is a huge advantage.\nCustomers tend to be very loyal to Publix, and might best \nbe referred to as “fans” of the company. “Customers enjoy \nshopping at Publix in large part because employees seem to \nactually enjoy working there.” Deli sandwiches are among the \nfavorites of customers, and they line up for sub sandwiches \naround lunch time. If customers get anywhere near a Publix \nemployee, they are guaranteed to be greeted cheerfully. If \na product rings through the cash register at a price that is \ndifferent from what it says on the shelf, the product is free. \nIn 2020, Publix launched two initiatives for its customers—a \npersonalized membership program called Club Publix and \nan Instacart Meals app that gives customers online ordering \ncombined with delivery or pickup of made-to-order food. \nPublix pharmacies provide customers with free prescriptions \nfor several oral antibiotics and maintenance medicines for \ndiabetes and high blood pressure, having filled its 100 mil-\nlionth free prescription in 2021. Even with the additional cost \nof all the extra service Publix provides to customers, its oper-\nating margins are higher than both Kroger and Walmart.\nPublix is also a great corporate citizen. For example, in \nApril 2020, Publix launched a new initiative to help farmers \nthat were being hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In 2018, in response to the trend toward \nhealthier foods, Publix opened a concept store in Tallahassee, \nFlorida, called GreenWise Markets, and announced its inten-\ntion to open more throughout the southeastern United States. \nGreenWise specializes in organic and healthy foods. The \nPublix name is not seen on the signage outside the store or \nanywhere in the store. The product mix is unique—the only \noverlap is that some of the GreenWise products are also offered \nin Publix supermarkets (but no Publix brand products are \noffered in GreenWise). GreenWise Markets are complemen-\ntary to Publix supermarkets rather than competitive, and are \ndesigned to appeal to a new target market. \nSince the first opening, Publix has opened GreenWise \nMarkets in Georgia, South Carolina, and more in Florida. “In \nthe Fort Lauderdale location, customers will find a ‘CUTS’ \nsection offering meat raised with no antibiotics or added hor-\nmones, as well as sustainably sourced seafood. Meanwhile, the \n‘EATS’ area serves up made-to-order meals and grab-and-go \nfoods such as gourmet sandwiches and fresh-baked pizza. \nMore foodservice offerings are available in the ‘POURS’ sec-\ntion, which has locally roasted coffee, wine, beer on tap and \nother beverages that customers can drink in-store.”\nSources: B.

This situation \nmeans that firms need to have a digital strategy to help implement all of their other \nstrategies (in this chapter, we discuss business-level strategies). An effective digital \nstrategy is based on digital principles—principles that redefine company imperatives \naround customers, growth, efficiency, and innovation. \nThe retailing industry has undergone some of the most drastic changes in the \npast few decades due to digital technology. It was not long ago that almost all goods \nwere purchased from physical stores. As the Internet got faster and enjoyed more \nwidespread use, digital platforms such as Amazon and eBay took an increasing share \nof retail purchases. Traditional brick-and-mortar retailers developed digital strategies \nto combat these advances, with varying degrees of success. The COVID-19 pandemic \nreinforced the popularity of digital purchases. Now, many traditional retailers are suf-\nfering from lost sales \nand, in some cases, \neven facing the real-\nity that they may not \nsurvive much longer.\nBecause of the \nmarch of digital \ntechnologies, a new \nmind-set is emerging \nin the retailing in-\ndustry: omnichannel. \nIt is reflected by a \nbusiness model that \nprovides a seam-\nless experience to \ncustomers whether \nthey are buying \nsomething online or \nfrom a physical store \n(business models \nare discussed in this \nchapter). Traditional \nbrick-and-mortar  \nretailers are continuing to enhance their online experiences by creating web-based \nstores and mobile apps and increasing “the number of customer touchpoints \nthroughout the digital space.” Also, online retailers like Amazon (e.g., Amazon Go) \nare moving into brick-and-mortar spaces, sometimes without cashiers. These efforts \nhave blurred the line between digital and physical spaces.\nThe online Swedish clothing retailer ASKET found an innovative way to explore \nomnichannel retailing. Managers were concerned that customers could not experi-\nence the quality of ASKET products through their online store, so they tested differ-\nent pop-up stores in various locations in Stockholm and abroad. These pop-up stores \nwould last from a few days to a couple of months. After a customer visits a pop-up \nlocation, they receive an email with their own personalized size chart and instruc-\ntions for placing an online order.\nWhen implementing an omnichannel business model, firms need to train sales \nassociates how to use in-store technologies and help customers smoothly interact \nwith those technologies while they are in the store. Handheld devices that help lo-\ncate products and allow customers to make immediate purchases are common. Firms \nshould also leverage the mobile channel, allowing a high level of interaction with \ncustomers. In addition, data analytics strategies are important means through which \nomnichannel firms can analyze customer data to determine preferences. Collabora-\ntions with other businesses can also be important. For example, a firm may work with \nvendors to organize special events. \nAs with all strategies—whether purely digital, omnichannel, brick-and-mortar, or \nsomething else—committed leadership is essential.

Infor-\nmation and the technologies available to gather and analyze it are at the core of a firm’s effort to \nform a digital strategy. A digital strategy uses digital technology to help a firm understand its cus-\ntomers and their needs with greater clarity as a foundation for developing innovations that create \nmore value for those customers.3 A digital strategy is developed and implemented in combination \nwith other firm strategies. In the case of retailing, firms are figuring out ways to enhance a tradi-\ntional brick-and-mortar shopping experience through a digital strategy that makes the most out of \nboth online and in-person experiences.\nThis chapter is the first on strategy, which is the second part of the strategic-management process \n(as explained in Chapter 1). By selecting and implementing one or more strategies (see Figure 1.1), \nfirms seek to gain strategic competitiveness and earn above-average returns.4 Strategies are pur-\nposeful, engage rivals in marketplace competition, and demonstrate a shared understanding of the \nfirm’s vision and mission.5 A strategy consistent with the conditions and realities of a firm’s external \nand internal environments marshals, integrates, and allocates available resources, capabilities, and \ncompetencies to align them properly with opportunities in the external environment. \nBusiness-level strategy, this chapter’s focus, indicates the choices the firm has made about how \nit intends to compete in individual product markets.6 A business-level strategy is an integrated \nand coordinated set of commitments and actions the firm uses to gain a competitive advantage \nby exploiting core competencies in a specific product market.7 Given the complexity of competing \nsuccessfully in the global economy, the choices about how the firm will compete are challenging.\nEvery firm must develop and implement a business-level strategy. However, some firms may \nnot use all of the other strategies discussed in Chapters 6 through 9 of this book—corporate-level, \nmerger and acquisition, international, and cooperative. A firm competing in a single-product \nmarket in a single geographic location does not need a corporate-level strategy that defines its type \nand level of product diversification or an international strategy to deal with geographic diversity. \nBecause every firm must develop and use at least one business-level strategy, it is the core strategy—\nthe strategy that the firm forms to describe how it intends to compete against rivals on a day-to-day \nbasis in its chosen product market.8 The other types of strategy are built around the firm’s core \nbusiness-level strategy.\nThe purpose of a business-level strategy is to create differences between the firm’s position and \nthose of its competitors.9 To position itself differently from competitors, a firm must decide if it \nintends to perform activities differently or if it will perform different activities. 10 Strategy defines the \npath that provides the direction of actions organizational leaders take to help their firms achieve \nsuccess.11 In today’s complex competitive landscape, the successful use of a business-level strategy \nresults from the firm learning how to integrate its activities in ways that create superior value for \ncustomers.\nWhile firms devise their business-level strategies in the context of what is happening in its \nexternal environment, it is important to realize that they do not have to conform to all aspects of \nLearning Objective\n4-1 Explain what a \nbusiness-level strategy is \nand its purpose.\nA digital strategy uses \ndigital technology to help a \nfirm understand its customers \nand their needs with greater \nclarity as a foundation for \ndeveloping innovations that \ncreate more value for those \ncustomers.\nA business-level \nstrategy is an integrated \nand coordinated set of \ncommitments and actions \nthe firm uses to gain a \ncompetitive advantage by \nexploiting core competencies \nin a specific product market.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

They can, through their strategies, influence the environment.12 For example, \nearly in the company’s history, Walmart’s CEO Sam Walton devised a strategy of building large dis-\ncount department stores primarily in rural areas where consumers had no easy access to these types \nof retailers. At the time, the conventional wisdom was that such ventures would fail. In another \nexample, Bank of America is working to counteract the disproportionate increase in rents in urban \ncenters with a strategy that focuses on increasing affordable housing in those areas. Some tactics \nBank of America is using to implement this strategy include forming nonprofit alliances and offer-\ning below-cost loans.13\nWe discuss several topics in our examination of business-level strategies. Customers are the \nfoundation of success for all business-level strategies, and firms must continue creating value for \ntheir customers if they are to retain them.14 Consequently, we begin with a discussion of how a cus-\ntomer focus influences business-level strategies. We then define business models and explain their \nrelationship with business-level strategies. After our discussion of business models, we consider five \ngeneric business-level strategies. They are generic in nature in that any organization competing in \nany industry can use any of them.15 Our analysis describes how effective use of each strategy allows \nthe firm to position itself favorably relative to an industry’s five competitive forces (see Chapter 2). \nIn addition, we use the value chain (see Chapter 3) to present examples of the primary and \nsupport activities necessary to implement specific business-level strategies. Because no strategy is \nrisk-free, we describe the different risks the firm may encounter when using these strategies.16 In \nChapter 11, we explain the organizational structures and controls linked with the successful use of \neach business-level strategy.\n4-2 Customers: Their Relationship  \nwith Business-Level Strategies\nStrategic competitiveness results only when the firm satisfies a group of customers by using its \ncompetitive advantages as the basis for competing in individual product markets.17 Effective global \ncompetitors have become adept at identifying customers’ needs in different cultures and geo-\ngraphic regions, as well as learning how to respond to changes in customer needs. They establish \nreach, richness, and affiliation with their customers.18 The reach dimension of customer relation-\nships revolves around the firm’s access and connection to customers. In general, firms seek to \nextend their reach, adding customers in the process. Richness concerns the depth and detail of the \ntwo-way flow of information between the firm and customers. Affiliation, the third dimension, \nis concerned with encouraging ongoing customer interactions.19 Viewing the world through the \ncustomer’s eyes and constantly seeking ways to create more value for the customer have positive \neffects in terms of affiliation. \nFirms strengthen their relationships with customers by delivering superior value to them. \nStrong interactive relationships with customers often provide the foundation for the firm to earn \nprofits because of how well they serve customers’ unique needs. Delivering superior value often \nresults in increased customer satisfaction. In turn, customer satisfaction has a positive relationship \nwith profitability because satisfied customers are more likely to be repeat customers and because \nthey will spread the word to other potential customers. \nConsequently, firms give a lot of weight to customers when they are devising a business-level \nstrategy. In particular, managers must determine:\n1. who will be served,\n2. what needs those target customers have that it will satisfy, and\n3. how those needs will be satisfied.\n4-2a Who: Determining the Customers to Serve\nIt is important for a firm to decide who the target customer is that the firm intends to serve with \nits business-level strategy.20 Companies divide customers into groups based on differences in cus-\ntomers’ needs (needs are discussed further in the next section) to make this decision. Market \nsegmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on their needs.21 Market seg-\nmentation is a process used to cluster customers with similar needs into individual and identifiable \nLearning Objective\n4-2 Discuss the \nrelationship between \ncustomers and business-\nlevel strategies in terms \nof who, what, and how.\nMarket segmentation \nis the process of dividing \ncustomers into groups based \non their needs.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In the animal-food products business, for example, the food-product needs of owners of \ncompanion pets (e.g., dogs and cats) differ from the needs for food and health-related products \nof those owning production animals (e.g., livestock). Hill’s Pet Nutrition, which is a subsidiary \nof Colgate-Palmolive Company, sells food products for pets.22 Hill’s categorizes its food products \nfor cats as pets into three market segments: kitten, adult (one year-plus), and mature (seven years \nplus). The food products the firm produces and sells differ based on the veterinary-determined \nneeds of each segment of pet cats.\nFirms can use almost any identifiable human or organizational characteristic to subdivide a \nmarket into segments that differ from one another on a given characteristic. In Table 4.1, we show \ncommon characteristics on which customers’ needs vary.\n4-2b What: Determining Which Customer Needs to Satisfy\nAfter the firm decides who it will serve, it must identify the targeted customer group’s needs that \nits products can satisfy. Generally, needs (what) are related to a product’s benefits and features. \nSuccessful firms learn how to deliver to customers what they want when they want it. Having close \nand frequent interactions with both current and potential customers helps them identify individ-\nuals and groups’ current and future needs. For example, knowledge gained about the needs of its \ncustomers is driving Kroger, the largest grocery store chain in the United States, to enhance the \nspeed of its grocery delivery services.23 The company has been working with Instacart since 2017. \nNow, the partnership is working on a plan to deliver food and household products to customers \nin as little as 30 minutes.\nFrom a strategic perspective, a basic need of all customers is to buy products that create value \nfor them. The generalized forms of value that products provide are either low cost with acceptable \nfeatures or highly differentiated features with acceptable cost. The most effective firms strive con-\ntinuously to anticipate changes in customers’ needs. The firm that fails to anticipate and certainly \nto recognize changes in its customers’ needs may lose them to competitors whose products provide \nmore value. \nSuccessful firms also recognize that consumer needs change. For many years, Subway, which \nhas more locations in the United States than any other restaurant chain, has offered a fairly \nstandard menu, with only a limited number of new sandwich options for customers.24 However, \nafter a massive expansion drive, the firms have started to shrink, with a 20 percent drop in the \nnumber of domestic locations in the five years leading up to 2022. CEO John Chidsey realizes \nthat what customers really want is food they crave. The company overhauled its menu, claiming \nthat it is the biggest culinary change in its history. This overhaul was in addition to increasing its \nrestaurant count globally.\nTable 4.1 Basis for Customer Segmentation\nConsumer Markets\n1. Demographic factors (age, income, sex, etc.)\n2.

As explained in Chapters 1 and 3, core competencies are \nresources and capabilities that provide a competitive advantage for the firm over its rivals. Firms \nuse core competencies to implement value-creating strategies, thereby satisfying customers’ needs \n(how). Only those firms with a consistent ability to innovate and upgrade their competencies can \nmeet and exceed customers’ expectations across time.25 By continuously upgrading their capabili-\nties, firms can maintain an advantage over their rivals by providing customers with products that \ncreate value that exceeds the value created for them by competitors’ offerings.26 \nCompanies draw from a wide range of core competencies to produce products that satisfy \ncustomers’ needs. In today’s competitive high-tech environment, developing a core competence \nin the R&D function is critical. Tech firms like Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms (Facebook), and \nAlphabet (Google) recognize this reality and invest significant resources to deal with it. Another \ncore competence that is critical in many environments is firms’ ability to effectively manage their \nhuman resources. Strategic human resource management means that the firm’s human resource \nmanagement practices reflect either best practice in their industry or best fit with what the environ-\nment needs (typically with a focus on customers).27 In the hospitality industry, no firm is better at \nstrategic human resource management than Hilton.28 Year after year, the company is ranked as one \nof the best places to work, which is an even greater accomplishment when you consider how many \nof their employees clean rooms and work with (often grouchy) customers. This competency allows \nHilton to hire the best workers, which translates into higher levels of guest satisfaction, loyalty, and \nultimately higher profits.\nOur discussion about customers shows that all organizations must use their capabilities and \ncore competencies (the how) to satisfy the needs (the what) of the target customer group (the who) \nthe firm has chosen to serve. We will now connect these ideas to business models.\n4-3 Business Models and Their Relationship  \nwith Business-Level Strategies\nBusiness models are part of a comprehensive business-level strategy.29 While business models \ninform the development and use of the other types of strategies a firm may choose to imple-\nment, their primary use is with business-level strategies. as noted previously in this chapter, a \nbusiness-level strategy is the firm’s core strategy—the one the firm forms to describe how it intends \nto compete against rivals on a day-to-day basis in its chosen product market. As part of a firm’s \nbusiness-level strategy, the business model influences strategy implementation, especially in terms \nof the interdependent processes the firm uses during implementation.30 We use a discussion of \nbusiness models and their relationship with strategy as a foundation for then describing five types \nof business-level strategies firms may choose to implement. \nMultiple ways exist to define a business model.31 The general consensus across these defini-\ntions is that a business model describes what a firm does to create, deliver, and capture value for \nits stakeholders.32 As explained in Chapter 1, stakeholders value related yet different outcomes. \nFor example, for shareholders, the firm captures and distributes value to them in the form of a \nreturn on their investment. For customers, the firm creates and delivers value in the form of a \nproduct featuring the combination of price and features for which they are willing to pay. For \nemployees, the firm creates and delivers value through a job with compensation and benefits; \nemployees also have opportunities to develop their skills by participating in continuous learning \nexperiences.33 \nIn a sense then, a business model is a framework for how the firm will create, deliver, and \ncapture value. At the same time, a business-level strategy is the set of commitments and actions \nthat yields the path a firm intends to follow to gain a competitive advantage by exploiting its core \ncompetencies in a specific product market. Understanding customers in terms of who, what, and \nhow is foundational to successfully developing and using a business model and a business-level \nstrategy. 34\nLearning Objective\n4-3 Describe business \nmodels, including \ntheir relationship with \nbusiness-level strategies.\nA business model describes \nwhat a firm does to create, \ndeliver, and capture value for \nits stakeholders.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

However, as broadband speeds improved, consumers started to prefer the convenience of \nstreaming movies within their own homes. Netflix successfully changed its business model to one \nthat focuses on in-home streaming. Blockbuster did not change its business model and eventually \nfailed. Business-model innovation is difficult because of inertia, which is all forces that cause an \norganization to resist change.37 If a business model has been highly successful over a long time, it is \neven more difficult to change to a different model.\nFirms select from many different business models.38 For example, some firms use a freemium \nmodel. They provide a basic product to customers for free and earn revenues and profits by selling \na premium version of the service. Examples include Dropbox and Adobe PDF Reader. Firms that \nuse an advertising model provide advertisers with high-quality access to their target customers \nfor a fee. Traditional television networks and Pinterest are examples of firms using this business \nmodel. Also, firms can use a peer-to-peer model to match those wanting a particular service with \nthose providing that service. Two examples are Task Rabbit and Airbnb. We will now highlight \nthree other popular business models: the franchise model, the subscription model, and the digital \nplatform model.\n4-3a Franchise Business Model\nA franchise business model finds a firm licensing its trademark—and the processes it follows to \ncreate and deliver a product—to franchisees.39 In this instance, the firm franchising its trademark \nand processes captures value by receiving fees and royalty payments from its franchisees. The \nfranchisor may also sell the franchisees many of the products used during the business operation, \nas is the case with many fast-food restaurants.\nMcDonald’s and Panera Bread both use the franchise business model. However, McDonald’s \nuses the model as part of its cost leadership strategy, while Panera Bread uses it to implement \na differentiation strategy (both strategies are discussed in detail in the next major section). In \nthis regard, McDonald’s cost leadership strategy finds the company providing franchisees pro-\ncesses detailed in its franchise business model to deliver its customers consistent food items \nthat are offered at a low price, but with acceptable taste and service quality, and in a clean \nsetting.40\nPanera Bread also uses a franchise business model, but its model differs from the McDonald’s \nfranchise business model. One difference is that a person can purchase a single McDonald’s fran-\nchise, but Panera Bread doesn’t sell single-unit franchises. Rather, they work with a franchisee to \nopen several (about 15) bakery-cafes over 6 years.41 Operating in the fast-causal part of the restau-\nrant industry (McDonald’s operates in the fast-food part of the industry), Panera implements a dif-\nferentiation strategy to provide customers with tasty, very high-quality food at reasonable, but not \nlow, prices. As the company states: “What is good eating? We believe it is food and an experience \nthat leaves you feeling satisfied and nourished, without having to compromise between good and \ngood for you.”42 Through this differentiation strategy, Panera uses a carefully designed set of pro-\ncesses to offer differentiated food items in a differentiated setting to provide customers with value \nfor which they are willing to pay and at a cost that is acceptable to them. Thus, while McDonald’s \nand Panera Bread use the same business model, the model itself is developed differently because \nthe firms use the model to implement different business-level strategies.\n4-3b Subscription Business Model\nFirms that use a subscription business model offer a product to customers regularly, such as \nonce per month, once per year, or upon demand.43 Blue Apron uses a subscription business \nmodel. The firm is founded on the belief that the way food is grown and distributed is compli-\ncated, making it difficult for families to make “good” choices about what they eat. Blue Apron \ndelivers food directly to consumers, eliminating intermediaries such as stores by doing so. \nBusiness model \ninnovation occurs when \na firm determines that its \ncurrent business model is \noutdated, and successfully \nreplaces it with a newer one.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The company’s first inter-\nnational expansion was to Canada in 2010. Less than a decade later, \nthe company had subscribers in more than 190 countries, which is \nremarkable considering that each region has its own challenges, such \nas regulations and difficulties securing the rights to particular con-\ntent. In addition, there were many competitors already established in \nother countries, such as Amazon Prime. Now, most revenues Netflix \nreceives come from outside the United States.\n4-3c \nDigital Platform Business Model\nDigital platforms facilitate exchanges among a variety of stakeholders.46 A digital platform is an \nInternet-based location for exchanges of information, goods, or services to occur between pro-\nducers, consumers, and other members of the platform community. They include social media \nplatforms like Twitter or LinkedIn, media-sharing platforms like Spotify and YouTube, service- \noriented platforms like Uber and Airbnb, and knowledge platforms like Yahoo! and Quora.47 They \nare a way to manage autonomous complementors, stakeholders that work with, but typically are not \nin direct competition with, the platform provider.48 Sometimes a firm that is a complementor in its \nuse of a particular platform will develop a competing platform, but the need to establish legitimacy \nand not undermine the original platform can be a difficult process. For example, Cisco was able \nto create a new platform, Fog, while still working as a complementor within the Cloud platform \nthrough repositioning itself in the market and only partially competing with the Cloud.49 \nDigital platforms have promoted innovation and increased efficiency in many economic \nsectors, including ecommerce, videogames, automobiles, payment systems, mobile phones, and \nmany others.50 They come in many forms, including online marketplaces (i.e., eBay), search \nengines (Google), social media (Twitter), professional networking and hiring (LinkedIn), and \noperating systems (Microsoft’s Windows). There are two basic types: innovation platforms that \nfacilitate the development of complementary products and services (i.e., Android, Google) and \ntransaction platforms that facilitate buying and selling goods and services (i.e., eBay, Uber).51 \nSome platforms, like Microsoft’s Windows and Alphabet’s Google, have achieved near-monopoly \npower in their respective markets, with more than 70 percent market share.52 One of the biggest \nadvantages of a digital-platform business model is that it can be scaled quickly with relatively \nlower costs than many other business models.53 As the Strategic Focus demonstrates, digital plat-\nforms can also be a way to share excess resources among companies, thus enhancing efficiency \nin the economy. \nFirms that provide digital platforms capture revenues in various ways. Microsoft directly \ncharges for its Windows software, either directly or when a consumer purchases a hardware prod-\nuct (i.e., computer) that contains the software from another company. Alphabet collects fees from \nfirms that advertise on its Google search engine. Uber collects part of the fees charged to passengers \nthat use its services. Many of the most valuable companies in the world—Alibaba, Microsoft, Meta \nPlatforms (Facebook), and Amazon—operate at least one prominent platform.54\nA differentiation strategy is what has driven the popularity of most successful digital platforms. \nFor example, Amazon provides high-quality service for the products it sells, but it also provides \nexcellent service for the platform it has created that connects buyers and sellers directly. That \nis, many of the products sold on Amazon are shipped directly from sellers other than Amazon. \nIf a customer has a problem with one of these products that cannot be resolved with the seller, \nAmazon steps in and, in some cases, even refunds the customer. Differentiation is one of several \nbusiness-level strategies that will be discussed in the next section.\nDuplass/Shutterstock.com\nHome-delivery food-subscription companies, such as Blue \nApron, became widely used and saw a surge in business \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA digital platform is an \nInternet-based location for \nexchanges of information, \ngoods, or services to \noccur between producers, \nconsumers, and other \nmembers of the platform \ncommunity.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

For example, a firm that is attempting to make \nmoney and protect the environment is pursuing a hybrid business \nmodel. Because of all its activities in protecting the environment, and \nits mission to “save our home planet,” Patagonia (featured in the last \nchapter), the outdoor clothing company, is pursuing a hybrid business \nmodel. It is not enough to simply be a socially responsible company. \nMany firms are taking this approach. A hybrid business model requires \nthat one of the company’s primary objectives is to further a cause that \nsociety feels is important. In addition to protecting the environment, \nother causes that are being addressed through hybrid business models \ninclude the reduction of poverty, protection of children, education, and \nsafety. A constant tension exists in organizations that are pursuing a \nhybrid business model because the for-profit and for-purpose objec-\ntives are often in conflict, and the firm has to be careful in allocating its \nlimited resources across activities associated with each of the objectives. \nOne way a firm can make progress in addressing some of the \ngrand societal challenges while reducing the amount of potential \nconflict in the firm’s objectives is by designing a business model \naround what is known as the sharing economy, which is “a socio- \neconomic ecosystem that commonly uses information technology \n[digital platforms] to connect different stakeholders…in order to make \nvalue by sharing their excess capacities for products and services.” \nA sharing economy is good for the environment and the economy \nbecause it leads to more efficient use of resources. Also, it reduces \nthe need for some firms to engage in producing a good or service \nthemselves because they are readily available from other providers \nand easy to access through the digital platform. For both of these \nreasons, the sharing economy leads to an overall reduction in total \nresource consumption. The global sharing economy has grown from \nan estimated $15 billion in 2014 to a projected total of $335 billion  \nby 2025. It spans multiple industries, including vehicle rides, accom-\nmodations, labor, expertise, food, and electricity.\nPiclo Flex, based in the United Kingdom, bills itself as “The \nindependent marketplace for trading energy flexibility online.” The \ncompany creates “a single access point for various energy services, \nincluding system balancing, stability, and network capacity, with the \naim of making it quicker and simpler for operating energy assets to \nprovide these services.” Basically, providers of services sign up and \noffer what they have to sell, and buyers bid for these services in what \nare called competitions. There are over 300 providers of these ser-\nvices across multiple countries.\nPiclo Flex understands the importance of protecting the environ-\nment, and its digital platform is designed to maximize the efficient \nuse of energy services. One of Piclo’s investors is the Clean Growth \nFund, established by the U.K. Department of Business, Energy and \nIndustrial Strategy, and one of the U.K.’s largest charity-fund man-\nagers. The Clean Growth Fund invests in early stage, “clean growth” \ncompanies that are working to reduce carbon emissions. Another \ninvestor is Matt MacDonald Ventures, which is the corporate-venture \ndivision of a major consulting organization. These two investors \ndemonstrate very well that Piclo Flex is successfully pursuing a hybrid \nstrategy, where The Clean Growth Fund reflects a primary interest \nin the for-purpose objective and the Matt MacDonald investment is \nmore closely associated with the for-profit objective.\nSources: R.

Each business-level strategy can help the firm \nestablish and exploit a competitive advantage (either lowest cost or distinctiveness) as the basis for how \nit will create value for customers within a particular competitive scope (broad market or narrow market). \nHow firms integrate the activities they complete within each business-level strategy demonstrates how \nthey differ from one another.55 For example, firms emphasize the integration of different types of activ-\nities and thus, what Southwest Airlines emphasizes differs from what competitors like JetBlue, United \nAirlines, or American Airlines emphasize. Superior integration of activities increases the likelihood a \nfirm will develop an advantage relative to competitors as a path to earning above-average returns.\nWhen selecting a business-level strategy, firms evaluate two types of potential competitive \nadvantages: “lower cost than rivals or the ability to differentiate and command a premium price \nthat exceeds the extra cost of doing so.”56 Lower costs result from the firm’s ability to perform \nactivities differently than rivals; being able to differentiate indicates the firm’s capacity to perform \ndifferent (and valuable) activities. Thus, based on the nature and quality of its internal resources, \ncapabilities, and core competencies, a firm seeks to form either a cost-competitive advantage or a \ndistinctiveness competitive advantage as the basis for implementing its business-level strategy.57\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Firms serving a broad \nmarket seek to use their capabilities to create value for customers on an industry-wide basis. A \nnarrow market segment means that the firm intends to serve the needs of a narrow customer group. \nWith focus strategies, the firm “selects a segment or group of segments in the industry and tailors \nits strategy to serving them to the exclusion of others.”58 Buyers with special needs and buyers located \nin specific geographic regions are examples of narrow customer groups. As shown in Figure 4.1, a \nfirm could also strive to develop a combined low cost/distinctiveness value creation approach as \nthe foundation for serving a target customer group that is larger than a narrow market segment but \nnot as comprehensive as a broad (or industry-wide) customer group. In this instance, the firm uses \nthe integrated cost leadership/differentiation strategy.\nNone of the five business-level strategies shown in Figure 4.1 is inherently or universally supe-\nrior to the others. The effectiveness of each strategy is contingent on the opportunities and threats \nin a firm’s external environment and the strengths and weaknesses derived from its resource port-\nfolio. It is critical, therefore, for the firm to select a business-level strategy that represents an effec-\ntive match between the opportunities and threats in its external environment and the strengths \nof its internal organization based on its core competencies.59 After the firm chooses its strategy, it \nshould consistently emphasize actions that are required to implement it successfully.\n4-4 Cost Leadership Strategy\nThe cost leadership strategy is an integrated set of actions taken to produce products with features \nthat are acceptable to customers at the lowest cost, relative to that of competitors.60 Firms using the \ncost leadership strategy commonly sell standardized goods or services, but with competitive levels of \ndifferentiation, to the industry’s most typical customers. Process innovations, which are newly designed \nproduction and distribution methods and techniques that allow the firm to operate more efficiently, \nare critical to a firm’s efforts to use the cost leadership strategy successfully. Commonly, firms using the \ncost leadership strategy also scour the world to find low-cost producers to which they outsource various \nfunctions (e.g., manufacturing goods) as a way to keep their costs low relative to competitors’ costs.61\nLearning Objective\n4-4 Using the five forces \nmodel, explain cost \nleadership as a business-\nlevel strategy, including \nthe associated risks.\nCost Leadership\nDifferentiation\nFocused\nCost Leadership\nNarrow\nMarket\nSegment(s)\nBroad\nMarket\nTarget\nMarket\nFocused\nDifferentiation\nLowest Cost\nDistinctiveness\nBasis for Customer Value\nIntegrated\nCost Leadership/\nDifferentiation\nFigure 4.1 Five Business-Level Strategies \nSource: Based on M.

U.S.-based Frontier Airlines, as well as EasyJet and Ryanair (based in \nEurope) and AirAsia (based in Asia), all pursue a cost leadership strategy.62 These types of airlines \noffer “no frills” to their customers, which typically means no free drinks or snacks (except water). \nCustomers also tend to pay for any luggage they bring, even carry-on luggage. In addition, they pay \nfor features such as assigned seats or more legroom. \nAs described in Chapter 3, firms use value-chain analysis to identify the parts of the company’s \noperations that create value and those that do not. Figure 4.2 demonstrates the value-chain activi-\nties and support functions that allow a firm to create value when implementing the cost leadership \nstrategy. Companies lacking the ability to integrate the activities and functions shown in this figure \ntypically lack the core competencies needed to use the cost leadership strategy successfully.\nAs primary activities, inbound logistics (e.g., materials handling, warehousing, and inventory \ncontrol) and outbound logistics (e.g., collecting, storing, and distributing products to customers) \noften account for significant portions of the total cost to produce some products. Research suggests \nthat a competitive advantage in logistics creates more value with a cost leadership strategy than \nwith a differentiation strategy.63 Thus, cost leaders seeking competitively valuable ways to reduce \ncosts may want to concentrate on the primary activities of inbound logistics and outbound logis-\ntics. An example of this idea is the decision by several low-cost producers to outsource their manu-\nfacturing operations to low-cost firms with low-wage employees (e.g., China, Malaysia, Vietnam).64\nCost leaders also examine all support activities to find additional cost reductions. Developing \nnew systems for finding the optimal combination of low cost and acceptable levels of differentia-\ntion in the raw materials required to produce the firm’s products is an example of how the procure-\nment support activity can help when implementing the cost leadership strategy.\nEffective use of the cost leadership strategy allows a firm to earn above-average returns despite \nstrong competitive forces (see Chapter 2).

Because of the cost leader’s advan-\ntageous position, rivals hesitate to compete on the price variable, especially before evaluating the \npotential outcomes of such competition.65 Walmart and Family Dollar use the cost leadership \nstrategy. Successfully executing their strategies causes competitors to avoid focusing on the price \nvariable as a way to compete. \nSeveral factors influence the degree of rivalry that firms encounter when implementing the \ncost leadership strategy. Examples of these factors include organizational size, resources possessed \nby rivals, a firm’s dependence on a particular market, location, and prior competitive interactions \nbetween firms, and a firm’s reach, richness, and affiliation with its customers.66 The richness and \naffiliation Amazon has with its customers creates competitive challenges for competitors (even \nWalmart), as they ramp up efforts to challenge Amazon’s superiority in online sales. \nThose using the cost leadership strategy may also try to reduce the amount of rivalry they expe-\nrience from competitors. For example, they may decide to form collaborations, such as joint ven-\ntures and strategic alliances (see Chapter 9), to reduce rivalry.67 In other instances, cost leaders try to \ndevelop strong and mutually supportive relationships with stakeholders (e.g., important government \nofficials, suppliers, and customers) to reduce rivalry and lower their costs as a result.68 Guanxi is the \nname used to describe close relationships that Chinese firms develop with others to reduce rivalry.69\nBargaining Power of Buyers (Customers)\nPowerful customers (e.g., those purchasing a significant amount of the focal firm’s output) can force \na cost leader to reduce its prices. However, competitive forces mean that prices typically will not \nbe reduced below the level at which the cost leader’s next-most-efficient industry competitor can \nearn average returns unless the low-cost leader is trying to push the next-most-efficient competitor \nout of the market. When customers can purchase only from a single firm operating in an industry \n(e.g., a monopoly), they pay more for products. In some cases, rather than forcing firms to reduce \ntheir prices, powerful customers may pressure firms to provide innovative products and services.\nBargaining Power of Suppliers\nThe cost leader generally operates with margins greater than the margins its competitors earn. This \nsituation is especially true when its costs are relatively lower than competitors while its prices are \napproximately the same. Among other benefits, higher gross margins relative to those of compet-\nitors make it possible for the cost leader to absorb its suppliers’ price increases. When an industry \nfaces substantial increases in the cost of its supplies, only the cost leader may be able to pay the \nhigher prices and continue to earn either average or above-average returns. Alternatively, a pow-\nerful cost leader may be able to force its suppliers to hold down their prices, which would reduce \nthe suppliers’ margins in the process.70 For example, Walmart is large and powerful enough to \nsuccessfully pressure suppliers to keep their prices down and margins low.\nTo reduce costs, some firms may outsource an entire function, such as manufacturing to a \nsingle or a small number of suppliers.71 Outsourcing may take place in response to earnings’ pres-\nsure as expressed by shareholders, particularly institutional investors.72 In the face of earnings’ pres-\nsure, a firm’s decision makers may conclude that outsourcing will be less expensive, allowing it to \nreduce its products’ prices as a result. \nPotential Entrants\nThrough continuous efforts to reduce costs to levels that are lower than those against whom it com-\npetes, a cost leader becomes highly efficient. Increasing levels of efficiency (e.g., economies of scale) \nenhance profit margins. In turn, attractive profit margins create an entry barrier to potential compet-\nitors.73 New entrants must be willing to accept less-than-average returns until they gain the experience \nrequired to approach the cost leader’s efficiency. Also, to earn even average returns, new entrants must \nhave the competencies required to match the cost levels of competitors other than the cost leader.\nProduct Substitutes\nCompared with its industry rivals, the cost leader also holds an attractive position relative to prod-\nuct substitutes. A product substitute becomes a concern for the cost leader when its features and \ncharacteristics, in terms of cost and levels of differentiation that are acceptable to customers, are \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

When faced with possible substitutes, the cost leader \nhas more flexibility than do its competitors. To retain customers, it often can reduce its product’s \nprice. With still lower prices and competitive levels of differentiation, the cost leader increases the \nprobability that customers will continue to prefer its product rather than a substitute.\nCompetitive Risks of the Cost Leadership Strategy\nThe cost leadership strategy is not risk free. One risk is that the processes used by the cost leader to \nproduce and distribute its product could become obsolete because of competitors’ innovations.74 These \ninnovations may allow rivals to produce products at costs lower than those of the original cost leader \nor to provide additional differentiated features without increasing the product’s price to customers.\nA second risk is that too much focus by the cost leader on cost reductions may occur at the \nexpense of trying to understand customers’ perceptions of competitive levels of differentiation. \nSome believe, for example, that Walmart often has too few salespeople available to help customers \nand too few individuals at checkout registers. These complaints suggest that there might be a dis-\ncrepancy between how Walmart’s customers define “minimal acceptable levels of service” and the \nfirm’s attempts to drive its costs increasingly lower.\nImitation is a final risk of the cost leadership strategy. Competitors sometimes learn how to \nimitate the cost leader’s strategy using their core competencies. When imitation happens, the \ncost leader must increase the value its product provides to customers. Commonly, the cost leader \nincreases the value it creates by selling the current product at an even lower price or by adding dif-\nferentiated features that create value for customers while maintaining price.\n4-5 Differentiation Strategy\nThe differentiation strategy is an integrated set of actions taken to produce products (at an \nacceptable cost) that customers perceive as being different in ways that are important to them.75 \nWhile cost leaders serve a typical customer in an industry, differentiators target customers for \nwhom the firm creates value because of how its products differ from those its competitors produce \nand market. Product innovation, in which a firm creates a new or modified product or service to \nsatisfy a customer need, is critical to the successful use of the differentiation strategy.76\nFirms must be able to provide customers with differentiated products at competitive costs to \nreduce upward pressure on the price they pay. That is, a customer must be willing to pay incre-\nmentally more for the differentiated features of a product or service than the incremental costs \nassociated with producing them.77 When a firm produces differentiated features for its products \nat noncompetitive costs, the price for the product may exceed what target customers are willing \nto pay. If firms have a thorough understanding of the value its target customers seek, the relative \nimportance customers attach to the satisfaction of different needs and for what they are willing to \npay a premium, the differentiation strategy can be effective in helping them earn above-average \nreturns. \nThrough the differentiation strategy, the firm produces distinctive products for customers who \nvalue differentiated features more than low cost. For example, superior product reliability, dura-\nbility, and high performance are among the differentiating features of high-end automobiles such \nas BMW or Toyota Motor Corporation’s Lexus products. These product’s unique attributes, rather \nthan their purchase prices, provide the incremental value for which customers are willing to pay a \nhigher price (compared to offerings from low-cost leaders). \nTo maintain success by implementing the differentiation strategy, the firm must consistently \nupgrade differentiated features that customers value and/or create new valuable features (i.e., inno-\nvate) without cost increases that require prices that are too high to be attractive to customers.78 In \nother words, there is a careful balance between upgrading the features that continue to provide a \nhigh level of differentiation and the costs of producing them. Overall, a firm using the differentia-\ntion strategy seeks to distinguish itself from its competitors on as many dimensions as possible. The \nless similarity between a firm’s goods or services and those of its competitors, the more buffered it \nis from rivals’ actions. When firms are successful with this strategy, the ability to sell a product at \na price that substantially exceeds the cost of creating its differentiated features allows the firm to \noutperform rivals and earn above-average returns. \nMany dimensions are available to firms seeking to differentiate their products from competitors’ \nofferings.

In Figure 4.3, we show examples of value-chain activities and \nsupport functions that firms use commonly to differentiate a product. Companies without the \nskills needed to link these activities cannot expect to use the differentiation strategy successfully. \nNext, we explain how firms using the differentiation strategy can successfully position them-\nselves in terms of the five forces of competition (from Chapter 2) to earn above-average returns.\nRivalry with Existing Competitors\nCustomers tend to be loyal purchasers of products differentiated in ways that are meaningful to \nthem. As their loyalty to a brand increases, customers become less sensitive to price increases. The \nrelationship between brand loyalty and price sensitivity insulates a firm from competitive rivalry. \nThus, positive reputations with customers sustain the competitive advantage of firms using a differ-\nentiation strategy.80 Nonetheless, firms using a differentiation strategy must be aware of imitation \nefforts by rivals and aware of any resulting successes. This is the case between Samsung and Apple as \nSamsung seeks to improve on Apple’s products, potentially creating value for customers when doing \nso. In the context of competitive rivalry (see Chapter 5), Apple must respond to imitation efforts to \nimprove the value its products create for customers. Simultaneously, as a firm using the differentia-\ntion strategy, Apple must continue to develop new and novel products to maintain its reputation for \nproducing and selling innovative and stylish products that target customers find valuable.81\nBargaining Power of Buyers (Customers)\nThe distinctiveness of differentiated products reduces customers’ sensitivity to price increases. \nCustomers typically accept a price increase when a product still satisfies their unique needs better \nthan a competitor’s offering.

The idea struck us after years of \nstruggling to get to the workout classes we loved, while balancing \nour demanding jobs and busy families.” The company uses the latest \ntechnologies to create immersive, challenging workouts within peo-\nple’s homes. The best instructors available are combined with music \nand images that make exercising an enjoyable experience. Some of \nits programs, like Leaderboard, are live. Consistent with a differentia-\ntion strategy, Peloton’s exercise bikes and treadmills are priced signifi-\ncantly higher than most competitors in the industry, and the classes it \noffers add a monthly subscription fee. Owning a Peloton is considered \nby some as a status symbol, reinforcing its image as a highly differenti-\nated product. Rounding out its product mix, the company also offers \nclasses in strength training, yoga, and meditation.\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Peloton experi-\nenced “unprecedented demand” as people looked for ways to exercise \nwhile being isolated at home. The stock price sextupled in about 18 \nmonths. In response to this success, the company made huge invest-\nments in new products and capacity increases. Peloton also took a \nbig gamble and cut the prices on some of its products in an attempt \nto lure the middle class. However, supply-chain problems meant that \nthe company was not able to deliver its products promptly, which \nfrustrated a lot of customers.\nThe post-pandemic environment has not been kind to Peloton. \nAs demand for its products declined, so did the company’s financial \nfortunes. John Foley, Peloton co-founder and executive chair, intro-\nduced a restructuring plan in February 2022, “driving strategic initia-\ntives across our global team that will help us focus on areas that are \nin need of adjustment, including implementing a comprehensive \nrestructuring program. As part of this program, we’ve made the diffi-\ncult decision to reduce the size of the Peloton team by approximately \n2,800 positions globally.” The company also decided not to pursue a \nnew plant, opting instead for increased use of third-party manufac-\nturers. In addition, Peloton reduced its number of warehouses. The \ncompany also raised its prices significantly through added fees for \ndelivery and setup. \nRight after Foley’s announcement, Peloton appointed Barry \nMcCarthy as the new CEO. Then, in March 2022, the company began \ntesting a new pricing strategy in which customers rent an exercise \nbike that comes with a subscription for classes, all for one monthly \nprice. According to McCarthy, “There is no value in sitting around \nnegotiating what the outcome will be. Let’s get in the market and let \nthe customer tell us what works.”\nCompetitors are also taking a toll on Peloton’s business. Rivals \nare now offering very similar exercise equipment and experiences \nat lower prices. Myx, Echelon, and NordicTrack are among them. \nApple also launched its own fitness platform. As Peloton’s stock price \ndropped, an activist put pressure on the company to explore a sale. \nAmazon.com, among others, expressed interest. \nSources: S.

Purchasers of brand-name food items (e.g., Heinz ketchup, Sir Kensington’s ketchup, and \nKleenex tissues) accept price increases in those products as long as they continue to perceive that \nthe items satisfy their distinctive needs at an acceptable cost. In all of these cases, customers are \nrelatively insensitive to price increases because they do not think an acceptable product alternative \nexists. As we see in the Strategic Focus, Peloton hopes this will be true as they significantly raise \nthe prices of their exercise bikes and treadmills in response to slowing demand for their products.82\nBargaining Power of Suppliers\nBecause the firm using the differentiation strategy charges a premium price for its products, sup-\npliers must provide high-quality components, driving up the differentiator’s costs.

Entering an industry under these conditions typically \ndemands significant investments of resources and patience while seeking customers’ loyalty. In \nthese cases, some potential entrants decide to make smaller investments to see if they can gain a \n“foothold” (or a relatively secure position through which competitive progress is possible) in the \nmarket. In these cases, the firm’s potential loss if it fails to develop a foothold is minimal while the \ngain from developing a foothold could be substantial.84\nProduct Substitutes\nFirms selling brand-name products to loyal customers hold an attractive position relative to prod-\nuct substitutes. In contrast, companies without brand loyalty face a higher probability of customers \nswitching either to products that offer differentiated features that serve the same function (par-\nticularly if the substitute has a lower price) or to products that offer more features and perform \nfunctions that create more value. In these instances, firms may be vulnerable to innovations from \noutside the industry that provide superior satisfaction in terms of customers’ needs (e.g., Amazon’s \nAlexa in the music industry).85\nCompetitive Risks of the Differentiation Strategy\nOne risk of the differentiation strategy is that customers may decide that the price differential \nbetween the differentiator’s product and the cost leader’s product is too large. In this instance, a \nfirm may be offering differentiated features that exceed target customers’ needs. The firm then \nbecomes vulnerable to competitors that can offer customers a combination of features and price \nthat is more consistent with their needs.\nAnother risk of the differentiation strategy is that a firm’s means of differentiation may cease to \nprovide value for which customers are willing to pay, or how the firm seeks to differentiate its offer-\nings is unclear to target customers. A differentiated product becomes less valuable if competitors’ \nimitation causes customers to perceive that competitors offer the same product but at a lower price. \nFor example, does buying and using an iPhone create value that exceeds the costs and features of \nsome competitors’ offerings? \nA third risk of the differentiation strategy is that experience can narrow customers’ perceptions \nof the value of a product’s differentiated features. For example, customers having positive experi-\nences with generic tissues may decide that the differentiated features of the Kleenex product are \nnot worth the extra cost. To counter this risk, firms must continue to differentiate their product \n(e.g., through innovation) for customers at a price they are willing to pay.86\nCounterfeiting is the differentiation strategy’s fourth risk. Counterfeits have a trademark \nor logo that is identical to or indistinguishable from a legal logo owned by another party, \nthus infringing the rights of the legal owner. When a consumer purchases such a product and \ndiscovers the deception, regret creates distrust of the branded product and reduces differ-\nentiation.87 Because of this, firms take actions to prevent counterfeiters from imitating their \nproducts.\nFailing to provide crisp and identifiable differentiation to customers through a firm’s products \n(goods and services) is a fifth risk of the differentiation strategy. When this is the case, the firm \ndoes not meet customers’ expectations through its efforts to implement the differentiation strat-\negy. Another way of viewing this risk is to say that firms sometimes fail to create differentiation for \nwhich the customer is willing to pay when trying to implement the differentiation strategy. The \nStrategic Focus on Peloton demonstrates what can happen when a competitor’s products seem \nsimilar enough to consumers that they are starting to doubt whether Pelaton’s higher price tag is \nworth it.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Thus, firms implementing a focus strategy use their core \ncompetencies to serve the needs of a particular industry segment or niche to the exclusion of \nothers. Market segments firms may choose to serve by implementing a focus strategy that includes \nthe following:\n1. a particular buyer group (e.g., youth or senior citizens),\n2. a certain segment of a product line (e.g., products for professional painters or the do-it-yourself \ngroup),\n3. a particular geographic market (e.g., northern or southern Italy), or\n4. a certain technology (e.g., artificial intelligence [AI] or robotics).88\nWith regard to the fourth type of focus strategy, firms develop a technology strategy in which \ntheir focus is on developing expertise with a particular technology instead of selling to a partic-\nular market. They then sell this technology to other firms, who use the technology to implement \ntheir own strategies. For example, Reliabotics provides product design and development services, \nas well as turnkey robotic and automation solutions for firms in the automotive, manufacturing, \nand pharmaceutical industries. Specific examples of applications of their robot automation and \nengineering services include surface preparation, laser-guided robots with programmable motion \npaths, and additive manufacturing.89 Of course, a technology strategy can also be useful in a firm \nthat is pursuing one of the other business-level strategies—the technology strategy is used as a way \nto implement the core business-level strategy. For example, Microsoft is using artificial intelligence, \nbots, and other technology to keep from hiring new workers in its finance division.90\nAlthough the breadth of a target is clearly a matter of degree, the essence of the focus strat-\negy “is the exploitation of a narrow target’s differences from the balance of the industry.”91 Firms \nusing the focus strategy intend to serve a particular customer segment of an industry more effec-\ntively than can industry-wide competitors. Entrepreneurial firms, and certainly entrepreneurial \nstart-ups, commonly serve a specific market niche or segment, partly because they do not have \nthe knowledge or resources to serve the broader market.92 Firms implementing a focus strategy \ngenerally prefer to operate “below the radar” of larger and more resource-rich firms that serve \nthe broader market. The focus strategy leads to success when the firm successfully serves a seg-\nment whose unique needs are so specialized that broad-based competitors choose not to serve that \nsegment or when it creates value for a segment that exceeds the value created by industry-wide \ncompetitors.\nFirms can create value for customers in specific and unique market segments using the focused \ncost leadership strategy or the focused differentiation strategy.\nFocused Cost Leadership Strategy\nBased in Sweden, IKEA, a global furniture retailer with 465 store locations in 63 markets and com-\nbined sales revenue of 41.9 billion euros in 2021, uses the focused cost leadership strategy.93 Europe \nis IKEA’s largest market, with 275 locations. Asia is second with 93 locations. North America is \nthird, with 68 locations.\nDemonstrating the low-cost part of the firm’s strategy is its commitment to strive constantly \nto reduce costs without compromising quality. IKEA emphasizes several activities to keep its costs \nlow. For example, instead of relying primarily on third-party manufacturers, the firm’s engineers \ndesign low-cost, modular furniture that is ready for customers to assemble. To eliminate the need \nfor sales associates or decorators, IKEA positions the products in its stores so that customers can \nview different living combinations (complete with sofas, chairs, tables, etc.) in a single room-like \nsetting. The room-specific settings help customers imagine how furniture would look in their \nhome.94\nHighlighting the focus part of IKEA’s focused cost leadership strategy is the firm’s target market: \nyoung buyers desiring style at a low cost. Design is critical to the firm’s ability to provide style at a \nlow cost to these types of customers. Although it is a cost leader, IKEA offers some differentiated \nLearning Objective\n4-6 Explain focus \nstrategies as a business-\nlevel strategy, including \nthe associated risks.\nThe focus strategy is an \nintegrated set of actions \ntaken to produce products \nthat serve the needs of \na particular segment of \ncustomers.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Unique furniture designs, in-store \nplayrooms for children, wheelchairs for customer use, and extended hours are examples of the \ndifferentiated features IKEA customers like in addition to the low cost of the firm’s products. \nFocused Differentiation Strategy\nOther firms implement the focused differentiation strategy. As noted earlier, firms can differ-\nentiate their products along many dimensions. For example, Goya Foods differentiates itself by \nproviding a very wide assortment of high-quality foods while focusing on Hispanic consumers. \nFounded in 1936 by Don Prudencio Unanue and his wife, Carolina, Goya Foods, Inc. is the largest \nHispanic-owned food company in the United States. Goya offers thousands of high-quality food \nproducts from Mexico, Spain, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.95 The firm \nis a leading authority on Hispanic food and seeks to be a premier source for those desiring to \npurchase authentic Latin cuisine. By successfully using a focus strategy, firms such as Goya gain a \ncompetitive advantage in specific market niches or segments, even though they do not possess an \nindustry-wide competitive advantage.\nWith a focus strategy, firms must be able to complete various primary value-chain activities \nand support functions in a competitively superior manner to develop and sustain a competitive \nadvantage and earn above-average returns. The activities required to use the focused cost lead-\nership strategy are virtually identical to those of the industry-wide cost leadership strategy (see \nFigure 4.2); activities required to use the focused differentiation strategy are largely identical to \nthose of the industry-wide differentiation strategy (see Figure 4.3). Similarly, the manner in which \neach of the two focus strategies allows a firm to deal successfully with the five competitive forces \nparallels those of the two broad strategies. The only difference is in the firm’s choice of target \nmarket—that is, its competitive scope (see Figure 4.1). With a focus strategy, the firm chooses \nto focus on a narrow market segment. Thus, Figures 4.2 and 4.3, and the text describing the five \ncompetitive forces, also explain the relationship between each of the two focus strategies and  \ncompetitive advantage. \nCompetitive Risks of Focus Strategies\nWith either focus strategy, the firm faces the same set of general risks a company faces using the \ncost leadership or the differentiation strategy on an industry-wide basis. However, focus strategies \nhave three additional risks because of a narrow target market.\nFirst, a competitor may be able to focus on a more narrowly defined competitive segment and \nthereby “out focus” the focuser. This could be a competitive challenge for IKEA if another firm \nfound a way to offer IKEA’s customers (young buyers interested in stylish furniture at a low cost) \nadditional sources of differentiation while charging the same price or to provide the same service \nwith the same sources of differentiation at a lower price. Harley Davidson’s decision to sell electric \nmotorcycles may challenge Zero Motorcycles, a much smaller company producing only electric \nmotorcycles.96 As mentioned in Chapter 3, Harley is ramping up this initiative with a huge invest-\nment made possible by taking the electric motorcycle business public, reducing Harley’s percentage \nownership in the business but making it a formidable contender for market share.97\nA second risk is that a company competing on an industry-wide basis may decide that the \nmarket segment served by the firm using a focus strategy is attractive and worthy of competitive \npursuit.98 For example, while Peloton was the first major contender in the super-high-end exercise \nequipment market, now many other competitors have entered this segment.\nThe third risk associated with using a focus strategy is that customer needs within a narrow \ncompetitive segment may become more similar to those of industry-wide customers as a whole \nover time. When this happens, the firm implementing a focus strategy no longer provides unique \nvalue to its target customers. This may be what happened to RadioShack—the unique demand of \ndo-it-yourself electronic dabblers that RadioShack traditionally focused on dissipated over time. \nAlso, big-box-retailers such as Best Buy started carrying some of the “specialty” items RadioShack \nstocked. In response, RadioShack executives struggled to find the right focus and made too many \nstrategic changes over time, which ultimately led to the firm’s bankruptcy.99\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In general, it seems that \nmost consumers want to pay a low price for products that possess somewhat highly differ-\nentiated features. Because of these expectations, many firms engage in primary value-chain \nactivities and support functions that allow them to pursue low cost and differentiation \nsimultaneously. \nThe integrated cost leadership/differentiation strategy finds a firm engaging simultaneously \nin primary value-chain activities and support functions to achieve a low cost position with some \nproduct differentiation. When using this strategy, firms seek to produce relatively low-cost prod-\nucts that have some differentiated features that their customers value. Efficient production is the \nsource of maintaining low costs, while differentiation is the source of creating unique value. Firms \nthat use the integrated cost leadership/differentiation strategy successfully usually adapt quickly \nto new technologies and rapid changes in their external environments. Concentrating jointly on \ndeveloping two sources of competitive advantage (cost and differentiation) increases the number \nof primary value-chain activities and support functions in which the firm becomes competent. \nIn these cases, firms often have strong networks with external parties that perform some of the \nvalue-chain activities and/or support functions.100 In turn, having skills in several activities and \nfunctions increases a firm’s flexibility and its adaptability.\nConcentrating on the needs of its core customer group (e.g., higher-income, fashion- \nconscious discount shoppers), Target implements an integrated cost leadership/differentiation \nstrategy. The firm informs customers of this strategy through its “Expect More. Pay Less.” brand \npromise. The firm describes its strategy with the following statement: “We’re here to help all \nfamilies discover the joy of everyday life.”101 In addition to a relatively low price for its somewhat \ndifferentiated products (compared to Walmart), Target creates differentiation for customers by \nproviding them with a quick check-out experience and a dedicated team providing more person-\nalized service.\nFlexibility is required for firms to complete primary value-chain activities and support functions \nin ways that allow them to use the integrated cost leadership/differentiation strategy successfully. A \nnumber of Chinese firms, including some in the automobile manufacturing sector, have developed \na flexible architecture system through which they produce differentiated car designs at relatively \nlow costs.102 For firms seeking to balance cost reductions with sources of differentiation, flexible \nmanufacturing systems, information networks, and total-quality management systems are three \nsources of flexibility that help them implement the integrated cost leadership/differentiation strategy \nsuccessfully.\nFlexible Manufacturing Systems\nUsing a flexible manufacturing system (FMS), firms integrate human, physical, and information \nresources to create somewhat differentiated products and to sell them to consumers at a relatively \nlow price. A significant technological advance, an FMS  \nis a computer-controlled process that firms use to produce \na variety of products in moderate, flexible quantities with \na minimum of manual intervention.103 “A flexible manufac-\nturing system (FMS) can improve efficiency and thus lower \na company’s production cost. Flexible manufacturing also \ncan be a key component of a make-to-order strategy that \nallows customers to customize the products they want.”104\nAutomobile manufacturing processes that take place \nin the Ford-Changan joint venture located in Chongqing, \nChina, show the clear benefits of flexible production. This \njoint venture, with each firm owning 50 percent, manufac-\nturers Ford brand passenger cars for the Chinese market.105 \nComments from Yuan Fleng Xin, the manufacturing engi-\nneering manager for the Ford-Changan partnership, high-\nlight the benefits of using an FMS: \nLearning Objective\n4-7 Explain integrated \ncost leadership/\ndifferentiation as a \nbusiness-level strategy, \nincluding the associated \nrisks.\nThe integrated cost \nleadership/differentiation \nstrategy finds a firm \nengaging simultaneously in \nprimary value-chain activities \nand support functions \nto achieve a low-cost \nposition with some product \ndifferentiation.\nThis photo illustrates the flexibility of computer-aided manufacturing \nlines as two different vehicle bodies are pieced together on the same \nline.\nFMS car system.PNG\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Firms use an FMS to change quickly and \neasily from making one product to making another, allowing a firm to increase effectiveness in \nresponding to changes in its customers’ needs, while retaining low-cost advantages and consistent \nproduct quality. Because an FMS also enables the firm to reduce the lot size needed to manufacture \na product efficiently, the firm has a greater capacity to serve the unique needs of a narrow compet-\nitive scope. \nInformation Networks\nBy linking companies with their suppliers, distributors, and customers, information networks \nprovide another source of flexibility. When used effectively, these networks help the firm satisfy \ncustomer expectations regarding product quality and delivery speed.107\nEarlier, we discussed the importance of managing the firm’s relationships with its customers \nto understand their needs. Customer-relationship management (CRM) is one form of an infor-\nmation-based network process firms use for this purpose.108 An effective CRM system provides a \n360-degree view of the company’s relationship with customers, encompassing all contact points, \nbusiness processes, and communication media and sales channels. \nSalesforce.com is the world’s largest provider of customer-relationship management services. \nThe firm operates a CSM platform that helps firms integrate the efforts of their marketing, sales, \nand information technology teams. The company puts it this way: “Salesforce unites your market-\ning, sales, commerce, service, and IT teams from anywhere with Customer 360—one integrated \nCRM platform that powers our entire suite of connected apps. With Customer 360, you can focus \nyour employees on what’s important right now: stabilizing your business, reopening, and getting \nback to delivering exceptional customer experiences.”109 Firms use information about their cus-\ntomers to determine the trade-offs they are willing to make between differentiated features and low \ncost—an assessment that is vital for companies using the integrated cost leadership/differentiation \nstrategy. Firms also use information networks to manage their supply chains.110 Through these \nnetworks, firms use their supply chain to manage the flow of differentiated inputs as they proceed \nthrough the manufacturing process in a way that results in lower costs.\nTotal Quality Management Systems\nTotal quality management (TQM) “involves the implementation of appropriate tools/techniques \nto provide products and services to customers with best quality.”111 Firms develop and use TQM \nsystems to:\n1. increase customer satisfaction,\n2. cut costs, and\n3. reduce the amount of time required to introduce innovative products to the marketplace.112\nIt may seem counterintuitive that firms can reduce costs while increasing quality; however, \nthis reduction is accomplished because when a product is produced well, it requires less rework \nand leads to fewer rejections during inspection, as well as fewer customer returns. Firms able to \nreduce costs while enhancing their ability to develop innovative products increase their flexibility, \nan outcome that is particularly helpful to companies implementing the integrated cost leadership/\ndifferentiation strategy. Exceeding customers’ expectations regarding quality is a differentiating \nfeature and eliminating process inefficiencies to cut costs allows the firm to offer that quality to \ncustomers at a relatively low price.113\nToday, many firms have robust knowledge about establishing and using a TQM system effec-\ntively. It is typical for a firm’s TQM system to yield competitive parity (see Chapter 3) rather than \ncompetitive advantage.114 Nonetheless, because an effective TQM system helps firms increase prod-\nuct quality at a lower cost, it is particularly valuable for companies implementing the integrated \ncost leadership/differentiation strategy.\nTotal quality management \n(TQM) involves the \nimplementation of \nappropriate tools/techniques \nto provide products and \nservices to customers with \nbest quality.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

However, it is a risky strategy in that \nfirms find it difficult to perform primary value-chain activities and support functions in ways that \nallow them to produce relatively inexpensive products with levels of differentiation that create \nvalue for the target customer. Moreover, to use this strategy effectively across time, it is necessary \nfor firms to reduce costs incurred to produce products (as required by the cost-leadership strategy) \nand to increase product differentiation (as required by the differentiation strategy) simultaneously.\nFirms failing to perform the value-chain activities and support functions optimally when \nimplementing the integrated cost leadership/differentiation strategy become “stuck in the mid-\ndle.”115 Stuck in the middle means that a firm has a cost structure preventing it from pricing its \nproducts low enough to attract target customers and lacking sufficient differentiation to create \nvalue for those customers.\nThis appears to be what happened to J.C. Penney in recent years. A key decision made during \nRon Johnson’s tenure as the firm’s CEO (from November 2011 until April 2013) was to replace the \nfirm’s historic pricing strategy with a new one. Instead of offering sales to customers, often through \ncoupons, Johnson decided that the firm should engage in an “everyday low prices” pricing strategy \nthat he used with Apple Stores when he was an executive with that firm. In addition to eliminating \ncoupon-based sales, Johnson changed the firm’s floor merchandise and added boutiques/streets \nwithin the stores.116 Because of these actions, J.C. Penney became “stuck in the middle” in that its \nprices were no longer low enough to attract the firm’s historic customers and its merchandise failed \nto create sufficient differentiation to attract new customers. Firms that are “stuck in the middle” fail \nto earn above-average returns and earn average returns only when the structure of the industry in \nwhich they compete is highly favorable.117 \nDespite the risks, the integrated cost leadership/differentiation strategy is becoming more \ncommon and perhaps necessary in many industries because of technological advances and global \ncompetition. This strategy often necessitates a long-term perspective to make it work effectively \nbecause it may require several years to generate positive returns.\nSummary\n \n● A business-level strategy is an integrated and coor-\ndinated set of commitments and actions the firm \nuses to gain a competitive advantage by exploiting \ncore competencies in specific product markets. Five \nbusiness-level strategies (cost leadership, differenti-\nation, focused cost leadership, focused differentia-\ntion, and integrated cost leadership/differentiation) \nare discussed in the chapter.\n \n● Customers are the foundation of successful \nbusiness-level strategies. When considering custom-\ners, a firm simultaneously examines three issues: who, \nwhat, and how. These issues, respectively, refer to the \ncustomer groups the firm intends to serve, the needs \nthose customers have that the firm seeks to satisfy, \nand the core competencies the firm will use to satisfy \ncustomers’ needs. Increasing segmentation of markets \nthroughout the global economy creates opportunities \nfor firms to identify more distinctive customer needs \nthat they can serve by implementing their chosen \nbusiness-level strategy.\n \n● A business model, which describes what a firm does \nto create, deliver, and capture value for stakeholders, is \npart of a firm’s comprehensive business-level strategy. \nIn essence, a business model is a framework for how the \nfirm will use processes to create, deliver, and capture \nvalue. At the same time, a business-level strategy is a \npath the firm will follow to gain a competitive advantage \nby exploiting its core competencies in a specific prod-\nuct market. There are many types of business models, \nincluding the franchise, freemium, subscription, peer-to-\npeer, and digital platform models. Each type of business \nmodel can be paired with any one of the five generic \nbusiness-level strategies as the firm seeks to compete \nsuccessfully against rivals. Business model innovation \noccurs when firms determine that their current business \nmodel is outdated, and they replace it with a newer \nmodel. This is a hard process due to organizational inertia.\n \n● Firms seeking competitive advantage through the cost \nleadership strategy produce no-frills, standardized \nproducts for an industry’s typical customer. Firms must \noffer these low-cost products to customers with com-\npetitive levels of differentiation. Firms using this strat-\negy earn above-average returns when they learn how \nto emphasize efficiency such that their costs are lower \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Customers pay a price for differentiated \nproducts that they believe is competitive relative to \nthe product’s features as compared to the cost/fea-\nture combinations available from competitors’ goods. \nBecause of their distinctiveness, differentiated products \ncarry a premium price. Firms differentiate products on \nany dimension that some customer group values. Firms \nusing this strategy seek to differentiate their products \nfrom competitors’ products on as many dimensions as \npossible. The less similarity to competitors’ offerings, the \nmore buffered a firm is from competition with its rivals.\n \n● Risks associated with the differentiation strategy include \n(1) a customer group’s decision that the unique features \nprovided by the differentiated product over the cost \nleader’s product are no longer worth a premium price, \n(2) the inability of a differentiated product to create the \ntype of value for which customers are willing to pay a \npremium price, (3) the ability of competitors to provide \ncustomers with products that have features similar to \nthose of the differentiated product, but at a lower cost, \n(4) the threat of counterfeiting, whereby firms produce a \ncheap imitation of a differentiated product, and (5) failing \nto implement the differentiation strategy in ways that \ncreate value for which customers are willing to pay.\n \n● Through the cost leadership and differentiated focus \nstrategies, firms serve the needs of a narrow market \nsegment (e.g., a buyer group, product segment, or \ngeographic area). This strategy is successful when \nfirms have the core competencies required to provide \nvalue to a specialized market segment that exceeds \nthe value available from firms serving customers \nacross the total market (industry).\n \n● The competitive risks of focus strategies include (1) a \ncompetitor’s ability to use its core competencies to \nout-focus the focuser by serving an even more narrowly \ndefined market segment, (2) decisions by industry- \nwide competitors to focus on a customer group’s \nspecialized needs, and (3) a reduction in differences \nof the needs between customers in a narrow market \nsegment and the industry-wide market.\n \n● Firms using the integrated cost leadership/differentia-\ntion strategy strive to provide customers with relatively \nlow-cost products that also have valued differentiated \nfeatures. Flexibility is required for firms to learn how to \nuse primary value-chain activities and support func-\ntions in ways that allow them to produce differentiated \nproducts at relatively low costs. Flexible manufacturing \nsystems, improvements to them, and interconnected \ninformation systems within and between firms (buyers \nand suppliers) facilitate the flexibility that supports the \nuse of the integrated strategy. Continuous improve-\nments to a firm’s work processes as brought about by a \ntotal quality management (TQM) system also facilitate \nthe use of the integrated strategy. The primary risk \nof this strategy is that a firm might produce products \nthat do not offer sufficient value in terms of either low \ncost or differentiation. In such cases, the company \nbecomes “stuck in the middle.” Firms stuck in the mid-\ndle compete at a disadvantage and are unable to earn \nmore-than-average returns.\nKey Terms\nbusiness-level strategy 88\nbusiness model 91\nbusiness model innovation 92\ncost leadership strategy 95\ndifferentiation strategy 98\ndigital platform 93\ndigital strategy 88\nfocus strategy 102\nintegrated cost leadership/differentiation strategy 104\nmarket segmentation 89\ntotal quality management (TQM) 105\nReview Questions\n1.

United \nParcel Service (UPS), the multinational shipping and supply \nchain management company, uses the integrated cost lead-\nership/differentiation business-level strategy. “Strategy has \nnever been taken lightly for UPS. Monthly meetings of teams \nspecifically formed to envision the future and assess decisions \nhave always played a large role in UPS’s approach to low-cost \nmanagement and differentiation through quality customer \nservice.”\nUPS is led by CEO Carol B. Tomé. Prior to joining UPS, \nshe was executive vice president and chief financial officer of \nthe Home Depot. Her first position at UPS was as vice pres-\nident and treasurer. From a business-level strategy perspec-\ntive, Home Depot is very much like UPS–both companies \nemphasize keeping operating costs low and customer service \nhigh. Consequently, her skills and experience make her an \nexcellent choice to lead UPS. She also has a clear vision for \nthe company. According to Tomé, “UPS is a company with a \nproud past and an even brighter future. Our values define us. \nOur culture differentiates us. At UPS we are customer first, \npeople led and innovation driven.” The company’s “Customer \nFirst” strategy is about providing the best digital experience \nto customers, making it simple to work with UPS, and remov-\ning any hindrances that interfere with an excellent customer \nexperience. “People Led” means providing an outstanding \nemployment experience and increasing the likelihood that \nan employee will recommend UPS as a great place to work. \n“Innovation Driven” pertains to implementing technology \nand productivity initiatives on an ongoing basis, and to pro-\nviding high returns to shareholders.\nAlthough UPS prices remain reasonable because of com-\npetition in the industry, the company doesn’t focus on price. \n“We offer a relatively inexpensive service that can help cus-\ntomers ship packages practically anywhere. We promise great \ncustomer service and timely deliveries. Our prices have gone \nup in recent years in comparison to our closest rival FedEx, \nbut our quality and service has not been diminished. With \nnew technology we have been able to deliver products faster \nand more efficiently to your front door.”\nIt is important to remember that the low-cost portion of \nan integrated cost leadership/differentiation business-level \nstrategy does not mean the company will offer the lowest \nprices. Low-cost pertains to the cost of providing customers \nwith a product or service and not the price charged. To keep \noperating costs low, UPS takes advantage of every techno-\nlogical innovation that can help the company reduce costs. \nIt also does things that others might consider extreme with \nregard to its operations. For example, UPS delivery routes are \nmapped out before a driver leaves so that left-hand turns are \navoided. This saves miles on the road, which also reduces the \ncompany’s carbon footprint. \nDespite its long history of success, UPS faces some chal-\nlenges going forward. One of the greatest of these is the broad \nmarket shift to more residential deliveries. The pandemic led \nto a lot more online sales by individual consumers, and it \nappears that the increase in residential deliveries relative to \nbusiness-to-business deliveries is going to remain. Business-\nto-consumer deliveries are lower in weight and require more \nstops. According to President of U.S. Operations George \nWillis, miles driven have increased by 10 percent and stops \nby 15 percent, while the average weight of packages declined. \nAt the same time, competition is coming from unexpected \nplaces. For example, Amazon is growing its own cargo net-\nwork, buying its own cargo planes, and using private entre-\npreneurial companies as partners to enhance its delivery \nvolume through its Amazon Delivery Service Partner (DSP) \nbusiness.\nSources: 2022, Women CEOs of the S&P 500, Catalyst, www.catalyst.org, \nMarch 25; 2022, Carol B.

The firm has a well-known brand name, a historic ability to satisfy \nstakeholders through its performance, and a vision of “imagining a world with Zero \nhunger and Zero waste as we transform communities and improve health for millions \nof Americans.” Because of these strengths, Kroger appears to have the potential \nrequired to achieve its objective of serving the “customer of tomorrow” effectively \nand efficiently. However, the grocery industry has experienced tremendous changes \nin recent years, with non-U.S.-based companies like the low-priced grocer ALDI \n(Germany) and the global giant Walmart—traditionally not engaged in the grocery \nindustry—claiming large portions of the U.S. grocery market. In addition, domestic \ngiants like Albertsons are formidable competitors.\nDigital technologies are a major force driving rivalry in the industry. Saying that \nhis firm is “incredibly focused on the customer of the future,” Kroger Co.’s CEO, Rodney \nMcMullen, noted that investments in online ordering and the ability to stock new \nproducts in its stores are vital to the firm’s future success. However, in addition to \ntraditional grocers beefing up their digital technologies and Walmart’s huge invest-\nments to enhance the online grocery ordering experience and delivery options for \ncustomers, Kroger now faces additional competition from Amazon through Amazon’s \npurchase of Whole Foods. Amazon paid approximately $13.7 billion to buy Whole \nFoods in 2017.\nAmazon’s purchase of Whole \nFoods is a strategic action, \ndefined and discussed later in \nthis chapter. Strategic actions \nfind firms allocating substantial \nresources to support signifi-\ncant market-based actions with \nthe potential to affect compe-\ntition among industry rivals. \nSpeaking about the acquisition \nof Whole Foods, some analysts \nsuggest that “the impact of this \nin the grocery industry is going \nto be huge.” Strategic actions, \nsuch as Amazon’s purchase of \nWhole Foods, typically elicit \nstrategic responses. As explored \nin this chapter, strategic \nresponses, which also are \nresource-intensive, are actions \ncompetitors take to respond in the marketplace to a rival’s strategic action(s). \nIn contemplating the actions they will take in response to Amazon’s purchase of \nWhole Foods, Kroger and other traditional grocery storefront operators, such as Alb-\nertsons, must recognize the significance of the challenge they face. Some believe, \nfor example, that “the shift to e-commerce is not like the other marketplace ebbs \nand flows Kroger has weathered over the years. It is a dramatically different business \nmodel, with a new set of competitors, logistical hurdles and profitability imped-\niments.” Of course, COVID-19 accelerated the rate of change in the grocery store \nindustry, as many shoppers are now comfortable with online ordering, delivery, and \npickup.\nRecognizing this reality, Kroger’s CEO observed that “investments in online order-\ning were critical to Kroger’s future and would take two or three years to build.” Exam-\nples of the strategic response Kroger is taking relative to Amazon’s strategic action—\nand those of other competitors as well—include the following: (1) building fewer \nphysical stores as a means of generating financial capital to develop ecommerce \noptions; (2) increasing the number of its storefront locations where customers can \ncollect groceries they ordered online; (3) working with suppliers to reduce its freight \ncosts, with generated savings going to ecommerce investments; (4) re-engineering \nits supply chain to become “more omnichannel, allowing (its) customers to order via \nKoshiro K/Shutterstock.com\nGrocers and their customers have embraced online \nordering.\n© anilakkus / Getty Images\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Thus, while Kroger is responding to actions launched by rivals such \nas Amazon and Walmart, those firms will respond to Kroger’s responses. For example, almost \nimmediately after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon assessed ways to offer Whole Foods’ prod-\nucts to its Prime customers. This tactic is one example of Amazon’s apparent intention of using \nWhole Foods’ physical locations to expand its grocery delivery services. Over time, we can \nexpect to see continuing efforts between Amazon and Kroger (and between these firms and \nother grocery industry competitors) to establish a favorable position in the marketplace. \nSources: G.

Of course, Kroger and Whole Foods compete against many other rivals, \nincluding Albertsons, Costco, Walmart, Target, and Aldi.\nFirms interact with competitors as part of the broad context within which they operate while \nattempting to earn above-average returns.2 Another way to consider this idea is to note that firms \ndo not compete in a vacuum. Each firm’s actions are part of a mosaic of competitive actions and \nresponses among a host of companies seeking the same objective—establishing a desirable position \nin the market as a means of superior performance relative to competitors. These firms partici-\npate in what is called a business ecosystem. Chapter 2 defined a business ecosystem as “a complex \nnetwork of interconnected organizations—suppliers, customers, government agencies, technology \nsuppliers, financiers, and other stakeholders—whose competitive and cooperative efforts are asso-\nciated with the satisfaction of a particular value proposition (i.e., product or service).”3 \nIndustries (comprised of firms producing products that are close substitutes) evolve through \nthe competitive give and take of direct competitors as well as the actions of other firms within their \necosystems.4 Innovation is essential in this process.5 When a firm innovates, whether in its products \nand services (product innovation) or in the way they are produced and delivered (process inno-\nvation), other firms in the industry feel pressure to do likewise so they can remain competitive.6 \nIn addition, other firms in the ecosystem (e.g., suppliers) provide the new supplies and compo-\nnents that the innovation requires. They compete with each other just as final product producers \ncompete with each other.7 For example, if the Chinese computer manufacturer Lenovo develops a \nsignificant new feature for its laptop computers, industry competitors HP, Dell, Apple, and Asus \nwill feel pressure to match or surpass that feature to remain competitive. Within the broader com-\nputer ecosystem, suppliers will compete to provide Lenovo with what it needs to implement the \nnew feature. Lenovo’s customers (i.e., big box electronic stores, Amazon and other online retailers, \ndiscount department stores, etc.) will compete with each other for the most effective way to mar-\nket and sell laptops with the new feature. Over time, these sorts of competitive actions define the \nindustry and the larger ecosystem to which it belongs.8\n5-1a A Basic Understanding of Competitive Rivalry\nCompetitive rivalry describes competitive actions and competitive responses that occur among \nfirms as they maneuver for an advantageous market position.9 Evidence shows that the decisions \nLearning Objective \n5-1 Define competitors, \ncompetitive rivalry, \ncompetitive behavior, \nand competitive \ndynamics. \nCompetitors are firms \noperating in the same market, \noffering similar products, and \ntargeting similar customers.\nCompetitive rivalry \ndescribes competitive actions \nand responses among \nfirms as they maneuver for \nan advantageous market \nposition.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In this sense, Amazon’s interest in Whole Foods as a \ndistribution channel may exceed its interest in Whole Foods’ physical storefronts.15 In response to \nAmazon’s competitive behavior, Kroger and other competitors are defending their current market \npositions (e.g., Kroger’s storefront operations) while trying to enhance their competitive ability in \nrelated market positions (e.g., Kroger’s actions to improve its ecommerce operations).\nIncreasingly, competitors engage in competitive actions and responses in more than one mar-\nket.16 United and Delta, and Alphabet (Google) and Apple are examples of this phenomenon. Firms \ncompeting against each other in several product or geographic markets engage in multipoint \ncompetition.17 Competitive dynamics is the complete set of competitive actions and responses \ntaken by all firms competing within a market.18 We show the relationships among competitors, \ncompetitive rivalry, competitive behavior, and competitive dynamics in Figure 5.1.\nIn this chapter, we focus on competitive rivalry and competitive dynamics. A firm’s strategies are \ndynamic in that actions one firm takes elicit responses from competitors that typically result in responses \nfrom the firm taking the initial action.19 Dynamism describes the competition among technology giants \nto gain a leadership position in voice recognition. In the early stages of the competition, Amazon’s Alexa \nwas the market leader. However, competition for the leadership position in voice recognition is intense \nas Amazon battles with Apple, Nuance Communications, Microsoft, IBM, and Alphabet (Google).20\nCompetitive rivalries such as this one in the voice recognition market affect a firm’s strategies. \nThis effect is because a strategy’s success is a function of the firm’s initial competitive actions (also \ncalled “attacks”), how well it anticipates competitors’ responses to them, and how well the firm \nanticipates and responds to its competitors’ initial actions.21 Competitive rivalry affects all strat-\negies (e.g., corporate-level, merger and acquisition, international, and cooperative). However, its \ndominant influence is on business-level strategy. Recall from Chapter 4 that business-level strategy \nCompetitive behavior \nis the set of competitive \nactions and responses a firm \ntakes to build or defend its \ncompetitive advantages and \nimprove its market position.\nMultipoint competition \noccurs when firms compete \nagainst each other in several \nproduct or geographic \nmarkets.\nCompetitive dynamics \nis the complete set of \ncompetitive actions and \nresponses taken by all firms \ncompeting within a market.\n• To gain an advantageous\n   market position\n• Competitive Dynamics\n   • Competitive actions and responses taken by all firms competing \n      in a market\nCompetitors\nEngage in\nWhat results?\nWhy?\nHow?\nWhat results?\nCompetitive\nRivalry\n• Through Competitive Behavior\n   • Competitive actions\n   • Competitive responses\n   • Non-market strategies\nFigure 5.1 From Competition to Competitive Dynamics\nSource: Adapted from M.

Firms that develop and use effective business-level strategies \ntend to outperform competitors in individual product markets, even when experiencing intense \ncompetitive rivalry.22\n5-2 Strategic and Tactical Actions \nand Responses\nWhen engaging in competitive rivalry, firms use competitive actions and responses as well as stra-\ntegic actions and responses.23 A competitive action is a strategic or tactical action the firm takes to \nbuild or defend its competitive advantages or improve its market position. A competitive response \nis a strategic or tactical action the firm takes to counter the effects of a competitor’s competitive \naction. A strategic action or a strategic response is a market-based move that involves a signifi-\ncant commitment of organizational resources and is difficult to implement and reverse. A tactical \naction or a tactical response is a market-based move that firms take to fine-tune a strategy; these \nactions and responses involve fewer resources and are relatively easy to implement and reverse. \nWhen engaging rivals in competition, firms must recognize the differences between strategic and \ntactical actions and responses and develop an effective balance between them.\nIn December 2018, Cigna Corp. successfully merged with Express Scripts Holding Company for \n$67B. This merger was a strategic response to a strategic action taken previously by other firms compet-\ning in the same market. For example, at roughly the same time, CVS acquired Aetna, Inc., in November \n2018. Today, health insurers such as Cigna believe they must control additional parts of the value chain \nto earn above-average returns. The vertical integration within the value chain that results by combining \nhealth insurers such as Cigna and Aetna with pharmacy benefit managers such as CVS and Express \nScripts increases the opportunities for the companies involved to operate more efficiently.24 \nWalmart prices aggressively as a means of increasing revenues and gaining market share at the \nexpense of competitors. In this regard, the firm engages in a continuous stream of tactical actions to \nattack rivals by changing some of its products’ prices and tactical responses to price changes taken \nby competitor Costco. Similarly, to compete against grocery retailers such as Kroger and online \ncompetitor Walmart, Amazon reduced prices for some of Whole Foods’ products by as much as \n43 percent almost immediately after completing the acquisition of the upscale grocery retailer.25 \nAmazon is also making huge investments in robots to increase efficiency.26 The Strategic Focus \nprovides other examples of firms engaging in competitive and strategic actions and responses as \nthey jockey for position in the videogame market. \n5-2a  Non-market Strategies\nIn addition to strategic and tactical actions and responses, firms use non-market strategies to influ-\nence the nature of competitive rivalry in an industry or a specific market within that industry.27 \nNon-market strategies focus on altering a firm’s institutional environment as part of its compet-\nitive strategy.28 The institutional environment, as it pertains to non-market strategies, includes \ngovernment influences such as regulations that establish the “rules of the game” as well as informal \nrules or norms that are predominant within a market or industry.29 Basically, non-market strat-\negies are used to attempt to change the industry architecture to make it more favorable from the \nperspective of one firm or, if firms combine their efforts, a group of firms. Research has found that \nnon-market strategies can lead to competitive advantage.30 \nOn the government side, a regulation a government enacts that pertains to a particular market \nor even a whole industry becomes a rule to which all companies in that market or industry must \nconform, or pay the consequences. Consequently, many firms use tactics such as lobbying, making \ndonations to political candidates, and using media strategies that influence public opinion (i.e., \nsocial media, press releases, advertisements) to change the rules in their favor. For example, in \nChapter 3, we mentioned that Hans Cole, Patagonia’s director of environmental campaigns and \nadvocacy, testified to a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives in an effort to influence \nlegislators to enact more legislation to protect the environment. This action is consistent with \nPatagonia’s strong strategic emphasis on environmental protection in all of its products and the \nway they are manufactured.31\nLearning Objective \n5-2 Explain the types \nof competitive actions, \ncompetitive responses, \nand non-market \nstrategies rival firms \nengage in as they \ncompete with each other.\nA competitive action is a \nstrategic or tactical action the \nfirm takes to build or defend \nits competitive advantages or \nimprove its market position.\nA competitive response is \na strategic or tactical action \nthe firm takes to counter \nthe effects of a competitor’s \ncompetitive action.\nA strategic action (or \na strategic response) \nis a market-based \nmove that involves a \nsignificant commitment of \norganizational resources and \nis difficult to implement and \nreverse.\nA tactical action or a \n(tactical response) is a \nmarket-based move firms \ntake to fine-tune a strategy; \nthese actions and responses \ninvolve fewer resources \nand are relatively easy to \nimplement and reverse.\nNon-market strategies \nfocus on altering a firm’s \ninstitutional environment \nas a part of its competitive \nstrategy.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This \nsimple videogame would hook up to any television. Two competi-\ntors would turn little dials to make a paddle move up and down on \ntheir side of the screen, simultaneously protecting their goal from \nan oncoming “ball” while trying to hit it into their opponent’s goal. \nPong, sold by Atari, was the first commercially successful at-home  \nvideogame, and it helped usher in a global obsession with videogames. \nHowever, it came out after the first home videogame console, the \nMagnavox Odyssey.\nA lot has happened since the days of Pong and Odyssey. The \nmarket leaders in the gaming market are China’s Tencent Holdings, \nLTD and Japan’s Sony Group Corp. Tencent, China’s largest tech con-\nglomerate, is “both an internet and entertainment giant in China—\nthe equivalent of Facebook or Google—but gamers are probably \nmore familiar with Tencent’s investments into a growing number \nof game developers and publishers.” The company has over 300 of \nthese investments in its portfolio, including sole ownership of Riot \nGames (League of Legends) and 40 percent ownership of Epic Games \n(Fortnite). \nThe purchase of Riot Games qualifies as a strategic action because \nit was a springboard for a lot of what Tencent Holdings has done in \nvideogames. Several strategic tactics followed this strategic action \nto reinforce the firm’s position in the market, including giving devel-\nopers access to its platform so they can create games for it (e.g., Riot \nForge) and holding a League of Legends World Championship with \n12 leagues from around the world. Riot Games claims that League \nof Legends is the most-played PC game in the world. Tencent’s \n$8.6  billion investment in the Finnish mobile game developer \nSupercell was also a strategic action that has paid off very well—\n60 percent of Tencent’s $19 billion in gaming revenue in 2021 came \nfrom mobile gaming.\nLike Tencent, Sony (Japan) is a huge and highly diversified interna-\ntional company engaged in the consumer electronics, music, pictures, \nimaging, gaming, and financial services markets. In the videogame \nmarket, Sony is known for its PlayStation console and the very popular \nGrand Theft Auto and God of War game series. The most interesting \nthing about these two huge companies is that their gaming divisions \nare a small part of their overall business portfolios. Their size gives \nthem a lot of potential power to engage in strategic and competitive \nactions and reactions in the gaming market.\nAnother giant, Microsoft, stepped up its involvement in gaming \nwith a $75 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard (Call of Duty, World of \nWarcraft, Candy Crush) in 2022. Microsoft is already well known for its \nXbox gaming system and its popular game titles Minecraft and Doom. \nStill, this strategic action will make Microsoft the third-largest gaming \ncompany in the world. This strategy is part of Microsoft CEO Satya \nNadella’s vision to make the business software giant into a videogame \ngiant as well. The company hopes to lure even more gamers online \nand “turn its Game Pass subscription service into the Netflix of games.” \nThe market reaction to the announcement of this deal reinforces the \ncompetitive nature of this market. “Sony Group Corp.’s shares fell \nnearly 13% in Tokyo on Wednesday (January 19) on concerns about \nnew competition for its videogame business from the combination of \nMicrosoft Corp. and Activision Blizzard Inc.”\nIn the midst of these battles for supremacy in the videogame mar-\nket, here comes virtual reality. The best-selling virtual reality headset \nat present is the Meta Quest 2 (previously called Oculus Quest 2), \nbut  it is from Meta Platforms (Facebook) and not one of the big \ngaming companies. Meta reported $1 billion in spending for Quest \ncontent, and “sales of virtual reality and augmented-reality hardware \nmore than doubled during the 2021 holiday season, versus the prior \nyear.” Some experts believe that Meta has at least 85 percent of the \nmarket, although its virtual reality unit is still losing money. Sony also \nhas a headset, but it requires extra equipment and only appeals to \nthe most ardent gamers. Apple and Microsoft have also expressed \ninterest in the virtual reality market. It will be interesting to see this \nmarket evolve over the next few years, to see if Meta can hold on to its \nmarket leadership position in headsets, and what strategic and com-\npetitive actions and tactics competitors will take. To reinforce its posi-\ntion, Meta is pursuing the tactic of developing a higher-end headset.\nSources: A. Webb, 2022, It’s an all-out brawl in the metaverse, The Economist, March 7: 72; \nK.

For example, in the higher education industry, strong norms regarding \nretention policies (e.g., tenure) guide the actions of most research-oriented universities. Likewise, \naccounting firms are guided by strong norms regarding how they conduct their business—some of \nthese are documented, but many are simply rules that industry members understand. One norm \nthat is becoming widespread across many institutional environments is the norm that firms should \nbe socially responsible. As a result, firms sometimes engage in activities that will raise their image \nas a responsible corporate citizen (i.e., charitable contributions, inclusion efforts, employee welfare \ninitiatives) in an effort to gain legitimacy (and therefore power) in the eyes of other firms with \nwhom they conduct business or compete.32 \nThe two types of non-market strategies typically are complementary. For example, gaining legiti-\nmacy through socially responsible activities can improve a firm’s ability to influence governmental pol-\nicy, and a politically powerful firm can gain legitimacy and influence within its informal institutional \nenvironment. Consequently, “the coordinated management of corporate social responsibility and \ncorporate political activities may lead to better firm performance. However, corporate social respon-\nsibility and corporate political activities should be aligned carefully to utilize this complementarity.”33\n5-2b A Model of Competitive Rivalry\nCompetitive rivalry evolves from the pattern of actions and responses as one firm’s competitive actions \nhave noticeable effects on competitors, eliciting competitive responses from them.34 The ongoing \ncompetitive action/response sequence between a firm and a competitor affects the performance of \nboth companies.35 This pattern suggests that firms are mutually interdependent, that competitors’ \nactions and responses affect them, and that marketplace success is a function of both individual strat-\negies and the consequences of their use.36 Because of this, it is important for companies to carefully \nanalyze and understand the competitive rivalry present in the markets in which they compete.37\nResearch shows that intensified rivalry within an industry results in decreased average profit-\nability for the competing firms.38 For example, at least in the short run, increased rivalry among \nKroger, Amazon, ALDI, and Walmart is likely to reduce the profitability for all firms competing to \nsell and deliver grocery items.\nFigure 5.2 presents a straightforward model of competitive rivalry at the firm level; this type of \nrivalry is usually dynamic and complex. The competitive actions and responses the firm takes are \nthe foundation for successfully building and using its capabilities and core competencies to gain \nan advantageous market position.39 Companies can use this model to understand how to predict \na competitor’s behavior and reduce the uncertainty associated with that behavior. Being able to \npredict competitors’ actions and responses has a positive effect on the firm’s market position and \nits subsequent financial performance.40 Competitive dynamics describes the competitive behaviors \nassociated with all of the individual rivalries that occur within a particular market.\nThe remainder of this chapter explains components of the model shown in Figure 5.2. We \nfirst describe market commonality and resource similarity as the building blocks of a competitor \nOutcomes\n•  Market position\n•  Financial \n   performance\nDrivers of Competitive \nBehavior\n•  Awareness\n•  Motivation\n•  Ability  \nCompetitive Rivalry\n•  Likelihood of Attack\n    •  First-mover benefits\n    •  Organizational size\n    •  Quality\n•  Likelihood of Response\n    •   Type of competitive\n     action\n    •  Actor’s reputation\n    •  Market dependence\nCompetitor Analysis\n•  Market commonality\n•  Resource similarity\nFeedback\nFigure 5.2 A Model of Competitive Rivalry\nSource: Adapted from M.

We then discuss the effects of three organizational characteristics—awareness, motiva-\ntion, and ability—on the firm’s competitive behavior. This discussion is followed by an examina-\ntion of competitive rivalry between firms (interfirm rivalry). We explain the factors that affect the \nlikelihood a firm will take a competitive action and the factors that affect the likelihood a firm will \nrespond to a competitor’s action. In the chapter’s final section, we turn our attention to competi-\ntive dynamics to describe how market characteristics affect competitive rivalry in slow-, fast-, and \nstandard-cycle markets.\n5-3 Competitor Analysis\nAs noted previously, a competitor analysis is the first step the firm takes to predict the extent and \nnature of its rivalry with each competitor. Competitor analyses are also important when entering \na foreign market because of the need to understand the local competition and foreign competitors \noperating in that market.41 Without such analyses, firms entering the market are less likely to be \nsuccessful.\nMarket commonality refers to the number of markets in which firms compete against each \nother, while resource similarity refers to the similarity in competing firms’ resource portfolios \n(we discuss both terms fully later in the chapter). These two dimensions of competition deter-\nmine the extent to which firms are competitors. Firms with high market commonality and highly \nsimilar resources are direct and mutually acknowledged competitors. The drivers of competitive \nbehavior—as well as factors influencing the likelihood that a competitor will initiate competitive \nactions and respond to its competitors’ actions—influence the intensity of rivalry.\nIn Chapter 2, we discussed competitor analysis as a technique firms use to understand their \ncompetitive environment. Together, the general, industry, and competitive environments comprise \nthe firm’s external environment. We also described how firms use competitor analysis to help them \nunderstand their competitors. This understanding results from studying competitors’ future objec-\ntives, current strategies, assumptions, and capabilities (see Figure 2.3 in Chapter 2). \nIn this chapter, we extend the discussion of competitor analysis to describe what firms study \nto be able to predict competitors’ behavior in the form of their competitive actions and responses. \nThe discussions of competitor analysis in Chapter 2 and in this chapter are complementary in that \nfirms must first understand competitors (Chapter 2) before their competitive actions and responses \ncan be predicted (this chapter).\nBeing able to predict rivals’ likely competitive actions and responses accurately helps a firm \navoid situations in which it is unaware of competitors’ objectives, strategies, assumptions, and capa-\nbilities. Lacking the information needed to predict these conditions for competitors creates com-\npetitive blind spots. Typically, competitive blind spots find a firm caught off guard by a competitor’s \nactions, potentially resulting in negative outcomes.42 Members of a firm’s board of directors are a \nsource of knowledge and expertise about other businesses and industry environments that can help \na firm avoid competitive blind spots.\n5-3a Market Commonality\nEvery industry is composed of various markets. For instance, the financial services industry has \nmarkets for insurance, brokerage services, banks, and so forth. To concentrate on the needs of \ndifferent, unique customer groups, firms may further subdivide the markets they intend to serve. \nThe insurance market could be broken into market segments (such as commercial and consumer), \nproduct segments (such as health insurance and life insurance), and geographic markets (such as \nSoutheast Asia and Western Europe). \nParticular characteristics distinguish the individual markets that form an industry. For instance, \nin the transportation industry, the commercial air travel market (i.e., United, Lufthansa, Singapore \nAirlines) differs fundamentally from the ground transportation market (FedEx, United Parcel Ser-\nvice, Con-Way) in the nature of the services provided to customers. Nonetheless, although differ-\nences exist, many of the markets within an industry share some similarities in terms of technologies \nused or core competencies needed to develop a competitive advantage. For example, all compet-\nitors in the transportation industry need information technologies to provide reliable and timely \nservice. Commercial air carriers such as United, Lufthansa, and Singapore Airlines must there-\nfore develop information technology and competencies to satisfy their passengers, while ground \nLearning Objective \n5-3 Describe market \ncommonality and \nresource similarity as \nthe building blocks of \ncompetitor analysis.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

More formally, market commonality is concerned with the number of markets with \nwhich the firm and a competitor are involved jointly and the degree of importance of the individual \nmarkets to each.43 Firms competing against one another in several markets engage in multipoint \ncompetition, which was defined previously.44 Coca-Cola and PepsiCo compete across a number of \nproduct markets (e.g., soft drinks, bottled water) as well as geographic markets (throughout North \nAmerica and in many other countries throughout the world). Chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and \nconsumer foods are examples of other industries with firms often competing against each other in \nmultiple markets.\nFirms competing in several of the same markets have the potential to respond to a competitor’s \nactions within the market in which the competitor took an action and in other markets where they \ncompete with the rival. This potential creates a complicated mosaic in which the firm may decide \nto initiate competitive actions or responses in one market with the desire to affect the outcome of its \nrivalry with a particular competitor in a second market.45 These types of interrelationships compli-\ncate the rivalry between competitors. In fact, research suggests that a firm with greater multipoint \ncontact is less likely to initiate an attack but more likely to respond aggressively when attacked. For \ninstance, research in the computer industry found that “firms respond to competitive attacks by \nintroducing new products but do not use price as a retaliatory weapon.”46 Thus, in general, multi-\npoint competition reduces competitive rivalry, but some firms will still engage in attacks when the \npotential rewards (e.g., potential market share gain) are high.47\n5-3b Resource Similarity\nResource similarity is the extent to which the firm’s tangible and intangible resources compare \nfavorably to a competitor’s in terms of type and amount.48 Firms with similar types and amounts \nof resources tend to have similar strengths and weaknesses and use similar strategies in light of \ntheir strengths to pursue what may be similar opportunities in the external environment. In other \nwords, resource similarity increases competitive rivalry.\nResource similarity describes part of the competitive relationship between FedEx and UPS. For \nexample, these firms have similar truck and airplane fleets, similar levels of financial capital, and \nrely on equally talented reservoirs of human capital along with sophisticated information tech-\nnology systems (resources). Another big part of the relationship comes from the fact that the two \nfirms share many markets in common in various countries and regions. Thus, the rivalry between \nFedEx and UPS is even more intense because of the additive effects from both resource similarity \nand market commonality. \nConsequently, when performing a competitor analysis, a firm analyzes each of its competitors \nwith respect to both market commonality and resource similarity. When two firms have high levels \nof both market commonality and resource similarity, they use their similar resource portfolios to \ncompete against each other in many markets that are important to each. These firms are direct and \nmutually acknowledged competitors.\nIf a firm and its competitor have little similarity in their markets or resources, they are not \ndirect and mutually acknowledged competitors. Thus, a small, local restaurant concentrating on \nselling “gourmet” hamburgers is not in direct competition with McDonald’s. They have only one \nsmall market in common, and their resources are quite different. It is possible, then, for a small \nrestaurant to thrive even in the shadow of a huge competitor like McDonald’s. On the other hand, \nother small local restaurants would tend to have similar resources and, of course, they compete in \nthe same market. The competitive rivalry between the two small local restaurants is likely to be \nstrong.\nThe nature of the relationship competitors have with each other may change over time as well. \nConsider General Mills and The Kellogg Company (Kellogg’s). For decades, they competed against \neach other directly and aggressively to sell their cereal products. However, the competition between \nthese firms may become less direct in the future because of the actions these firms take. General \nMills, for example, acquired pet food company Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc. for $8 billion in 2018. \nOne reason for this acquisition was that the pet food business is “one of the largest center-of-the-\nstore categories in the U.S. food and beverage market.”49 Moving into pet foods finds General Mills \nMarket commonality is \nconcerned with the number \nof markets with which the \nfirm and a competitor are \njointly involved and the \ndegree of importance of the \nindividual markets to each.\nResource similarity is the \nextent to which the firm’s \ntangible and intangible \nresources compare favorably \nto a competitor’s in terms of \ntype and amount.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Smucker Co., in that Smucker paid \n$3 billion to buy Milk-Bone owner Big Heart. Similarly, Kellogg’s, whose CEO noted that “cereal \ndoesn’t have to be the growth engine of Kellogg,” is emphasizing other products such as Pringles \nchips, Cheez-It crackers, Pop-Tarts, and frozen Eggo waffles to stimulate firm growth. 50 Empha-\nsizing snack products could find Kellogg’s competing more directly with PepsiCo, the owner of \nsnack-giant Frito Lay. \n5-4 Drivers of Competitive Behavior\nMarket commonality and resource similarity influence the drivers of competitive behavior—\nawareness, motivation, and ability.51 In turn, these drivers of competitive behavior influence the \nfirm’s actual competitive behavior, as revealed by the actions and responses it takes while engaged \nin competitive rivalry (see Figure 5.2).52\nAwareness, which is a prerequisite to any competitive action or response a firm takes, refers to \nthe extent to which competitors recognize the degree of their mutual interdependence that results \nfrom market commonality and resource similarity.53 Awareness affects the extent to which the firm \nunderstands the consequences of its competitive actions and responses. A lack of awareness can \nlead to excessive competition, resulting in a negative effect on all competitors’ performance.54 \nAwareness tends to be greatest when firms have highly similar resources (in terms of types and \namounts) to use while competing against each other in multiple markets (e.g., multipoint compe-\ntition). Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are certainly aware of each other as they compete in multiple mar-\nkets to satisfy consumers’ beverage tastes. Because of evolving tastes and the installation of taxes \non sugary drinks some governmental agencies are levying, the companies are investing in healthier \nalternatives.55 However, developing new soda products to meet consumers’ interests is more crit-\nical for Coca-Cola compared to PepsiCo because PepsiCo’s ownership of food products such as  \nFrito-Lay means that it sells a number of items to consumers in addition to sodas. \nMotivation, which concerns the firm’s incentive to take action or to respond to a competitor’s \nattack, relates to perceived gains and losses. Thus, a firm may be aware of competitors but may not be \nmotivated to engage in rivalry with them if it perceives that its market position will neither improve \nnor suffer if it does not respond.56 Nonresponse in this situations is called strategic forbearance and is \noften a result of firms taking a broader perspective on the situation, considering the influence of its \npossible actions on stakeholders and the longer-term implications on competitive rivalry.57 A benefit \nof lacking the motivation to engage in rivalry at a point in time with a competitor is the ability to \nretain resources for other purposes, including competing against a different rival.\nMarket commonality affects the firm’s perceptions and resulting motivation. For example, a firm \nis generally more likely to attack the rival with whom it has low market commonality than the one \nwith whom it competes in multiple markets. The primary reason for this is the high stakes involved \nin trying to gain a more advantageous position over a rival with whom the firm shares many mar-\nkets. As mentioned earlier, multipoint competition can result in a competitor responding to the \nfirm’s action in a market different from the one in which the initial action occurred. Actions and \nresponses of this type can cause both firms to lose focus on core markets and to battle each other \nwith resources they could be allocating for other purposes. Because of the high competitive stakes \nunder the condition of market commonality, the probability is high that the attacked firm will feel \nmotivated to respond to its competitor’s action in an effort to protect its position in one or more \nmarkets.58\nIn some instances, the firm may be aware of the markets it shares with a competitor and be moti-\nvated to respond to an attack by that competitor, but lack the ability to do so. Ability relates to each \nfirm’s resources and the flexibility they provide.59 Without available resources (such as financial \ncapital and people), the firm is not able to attack a competitor or respond to its actions. For exam-\nple, smaller and newer firms tend to be more innovative, but they generally have fewer resources \nto attack larger and established competitors. Local firms’ social capital (relationships) with stake-\nholders including consumers, suppliers, and government officials create a disadvantage for foreign \nfirms lacking the social capital of local companies.60 However, possessing similar resources, such \nas is the case with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, suggests similar abilities to attack and respond. When a \nfirm faces a competitor with similar resources, carefully studying a possible attack before initiating \nit is essential because the similarly resourced competitor is likely to respond to that action.61\nLearning Objective \n5-4 Explain awareness, \nmotivation, and ability \nas drivers of competitive \nbehavior.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The rea-\nson is that the more significant is the difference between \nresources the acting firm owns and those against whom \nit has taken action, the longer is the delay by the firm \nwith a resource disadvantage.62 For example, Walmart \ninitially used a focused cost leadership strategy to com-\npete only in small communities (those with a popula-\ntion of 25,000 or less). Using sophisticated logistics sys-\ntems and efficient purchasing practices, among other \nmethods to gain competitive advantages, Walmart cre-\nated a new type of value (primarily in the form of wide \nselections of products at the lowest competitive prices) \nfor customers in small retail markets. Local competitors \nlacked the ability to marshal needed resources at the \npace required to respond to Walmart’s actions quickly \nand effectively. \nHowever, even when facing competitors with \ngreater resources (greater ability) or more attractive \nmarket positions, firms should eventually respond, no \nmatter how daunting the task seems. Choosing not to \nrespond can ultimately result in failure, as happened with at least some local retailers who did not \nrespond to Walmart’s competitive actions. Today, with Walmart as the world’s largest retailer, it is \nindeed difficult for smaller competitors to have the resources required to respond effectively to its \ncompetitive actions or competitive responses.63\n5-5 Actions That Drive Competitive Rivalry \nPreviously, we discussed how market commonality, resource similarity, and the drivers of aware-\nness, motivation, and ability affect the likelihood a firm will use strategic and tactical actions to \nattack its competitors. Next, we discuss three additional factors—first-mover benefits, organiza-\ntional size, and quality. In this discussion, we consider first movers, second movers, and late movers.\n5-5a First-Mover Benefits\nA first mover is a firm that takes an initial competitive action to build or defend its competitive \nadvantages or to improve its market position.64 Work by the famous economist Joseph Schumpeter \nis the basis for the first-mover concept. Schumpeter argued that firms achieve competitive advan-\ntage by taking innovative actions.65 In general, first movers emphasize research and development \n(R&D) as a path to developing innovative products that customers will value.66 Amazon was a first \nmover as an online bookstore, while eBay was the first major online auction site.67\nFirst-mover benefits can be substantial.68 This is especially true in fast-cycle markets (discussed \nlater in the chapter) where changes occur rapidly and where it is virtually impossible to sustain a \ncompetitive advantage for any length of time. A first mover in a fast-cycle market can experience \nmany times the revenue and valuation of a second mover.69 This evidence suggests that although \nfirst-mover benefits are never absolute, they are often critical to a firm’s success in industries expe-\nriencing rapid technological developments and with relatively short product life cycles.70 In addi-\ntion to earning above-average returns until its competitors respond to its successful competitive \naction, the first mover can gain\n\t\n●\nthe loyalty of customers who may become committed to the products of the firm that first made \nthem available\n\t\n●\nmarket share that can be difficult for competitors to take when engaging in competitive rivalry\nThe general evidence that first movers have greater survival rates than later market entrants is \nperhaps the culmination of first-mover benefits.71\nThe firm trying to predict its rivals’ competitive actions might conclude that they will take aggres-\nsive strategic actions to gain first-movers benefits. However, even though a firm’s competitors might \nLearning Objective \n5-5 Discuss factors \naffecting the likelihood a \nfirm will take actions to \nattack its competitors.\nA first mover is a firm that \ntakes an initial competitive \naction to build or defend its \ncompetitive advantages or to \nimprove its market position.\nSmall competitors find it difficult to respond to the competitive threat \nthat exists with Walmart. Yet, they must find a way to respond, perhaps \nby offering personalized services, so they can survive such a threat.\nduckeesue/Shutterstock.com\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

First movers \ntend to be aggressive and willing to experiment with innovation and take higher yet reasonable levels \nof risk, and their long-term success depends on retaining the ability to do so.72\nTo be a first mover, the firm must have the readily available resources to invest significantly in \nR&D as well as to rapidly and successfully produce and market a stream of innovative products.73 \nOrganizational slack makes it possible for firms to have the ability (as measured by available \nresources) to be first movers. Slack is the buffer provided by actual or obtainable resources not in \nuse currently and that exceed the minimum resources needed to produce a given level of organi-\nzational output.74 As a liquid resource, slack is available to allocate quickly to support competitive \nactions, such as R&D investments and aggressive marketing campaigns that lead to first-mover \nadvantages. This relationship between slack and the ability to be a first mover allows the firm to \npredict that a first-mover competitor with available slack will probably take aggressive competi-\ntive actions as a means of continuously introducing innovative products. Furthermore, the firm \ncan predict that, as a first mover, a competitor will try to gain market share and customer loyalty \nrapidly to earn above-average returns until its competitors are able to respond effectively to its \nfirst move.\nFirms evaluating their competitors should realize that being a first mover carries risk. For \nexample, it is difficult to estimate accurately the returns that a firm might earn by introducing \nproduct innovations to the marketplace.75 Additionally, the first mover’s cost to develop a product \ninnovation can be substantial, reducing the slack available to support further innovation. Also, a \nfirst mover into a new international market may actually experience more difficulty establishing \nitself in the new market than a second mover because it is seen as an outsider (i.e., a liability of \nforeignness).76\nA second mover is a firm that responds to the first mover’s competitive action, typically \nthrough imitation.77 Although its successful iPhone changed consumers’ and companies’ percep-\ntions about the potential of cell phones, Apple is a well-known second mover with many of its \nproduct introductions. In fact, “Apple has been second at most stuff. They’re not a true innovator \nin the definition of the word. They weren’t the first into object-oriented computing (the mouse), \nthey weren’t the first mp3 player, they weren’t the first mobile phone.”78 What Apple does extremely \nwell, though, is to study products as a means of determining how to improve them by making them \nmore user friendly for consumers.\nMore cautious than the first mover, the second mover, such as Apple, studies customers’ reac-\ntions to product innovations. In the course of doing so, the second mover also tries to find any \nmistakes the first mover made so that it can avoid them and the problems they created. Often, \nsuccessful imitation of the first mover’s innovations allows the second mover to avoid the mistakes \nand the major investments required of the pioneering first movers.79  \nSecond movers have the time needed to develop processes and technologies that are more \nefficient than those the first mover used or that create additional value for consumers.80 The most \nsuccessful second movers rarely act too fast (so they can study the first mover’s actions carefully) \nnor too slow (so they do not give the first mover time to correct its mistakes and “lock in” customer \nloyalty). Overall, the outcomes of the first mover’s compet-\nitive actions may provide a blueprint for second and even \nlate movers as they determine the nature and timing of \ntheir competitive responses.81\nDetermining whether a competitor is effective as \na second mover (based on its actions in the past) allows \na first-mover firm to predict when or if the competi-\ntor will respond quickly to successful, innovation-based \nmarket entries. The first mover can expect a successful  \nsecond-mover competitor to study its market entries and \nto respond with a new entry into the market within a short \ntime. As a second mover, the competitor will try to respond \nwith a product that provides greater customer value than \ndoes the first mover’s product. The most successful second \nmovers are able to interpret market feedback with preci-\nsion as a foundation for responding quickly yet success-\nfully to the first mover’s successful innovations.82\nA second mover is a firm \nthat responds to the first \nmover’s competitive action, \ntypically through imitation.\nApple, a well-known second mover, studies customers’ reactions to \nproduct innovations to avoid the mistakes of first movers.\nAntlii/Shutterstock.com\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The Hummer EV SUT was released \nin 2021. Although still available, the product struggles to find a target market of sufficient size to \nsupport GM’s ambitions for it.\nTypically, a late response is better than no response at all, although any success achieved from \nthe late competitive response tends to be considerably less than that achieved by first and second \nmovers. However, on occasion, late movers can be successful if they develop a unique way to enter \nthe market and compete. For firms from emerging economies, this often means a niche strategy \nwith lower-cost production and manufacturing. It can also mean that they need to learn from the \ncompetitors or others in the market so they can market products that allow them to compete.84 \nThe firm competing against a late mover can predict that the competitor will likely enter a \nparticular market only after both the first and second movers have achieved success in that mar-\nket. Moreover, on a relative basis, the firm can predict that the late mover’s competitive action will \nallow it to earn average returns only after the considerable time required for it to understand how \nto create at least as much customer value as that offered by the first and second movers’ products.\n5-5b Organizational Size\nAn organization’s size affects the likelihood it will take competitive actions as well as the types and \ntiming of those actions.85 In general, small firms are more likely than large companies to launch \ncompetitive actions and tend to do so more quickly. Because of this tendency, smaller firms have \nthe capacity to be nimble and flexible competitors. These firms rely on speed and surprise to \ndefend their competitive advantages or to develop new ones while engaged in competitive rivalry, \nespecially with large companies, to gain an advantageous market position.86 Small firms’ flexibility \nand nimbleness allow them to develop variety in their competitive actions; large firms tend to limit \nthe types of competitive actions used.87\nLarge firms, however, are likely to initiate a larger total number of competitive actions and stra-\ntegic actions during a given period because they have more resources to do so. Thus, when studying \ncompetitors in terms of organizational size, the firm should use a measurement such as total sales \nrevenue or total number of employees to predict the number of competitive and strategic actions a \ncompetitor might take.\n5-5c \nQuality\nQuality has many definitions, including well-established ones relating it to making products with \nzero defects or as a cycle of continuous improvement.88 From a strategic perspective, we consider \nquality to be the outcome of how a firm competes through its value chain activities and support \nfunctions (see Chapter 3). Thus, quality exists when the firm’s products meet or exceed custom-\ners’ expectations. Evidence suggests that quality is often among the most critical components in \nsatisfying the firm’s customers.89\nIn the eyes of customers, quality is about doing the right things relative to performance mea-\nsures that are important to them.90 Customers may be interested in measuring the quality of a firm’s \nproducts against a broad range of dimensions, which might include their durability, performance, \naesthetics, features, or many other factors. Quality is possible only when top-level managers sup-\nport it and when the organization validates its importance throughout its operations.91 It is a uni-\nversal theme in the global economy and is a necessary but insufficient condition for competitive \nsuccess.92 Without quality, a firm’s products lack credibility, meaning that customers do not think \nof them as viable options. Indeed, customers will not consider buying a product or using a service \nuntil they believe that it can satisfy at least their base-level expectations in terms of quality dimen-\nsions that are important to them.93\nQuality affects competitive rivalry. The firm evaluating a competitor whose products suffer \nfrom poor quality can predict declines in the competitor’s sales revenue until the quality issues are \nresolved. Firms are more likely to attack a rival when it is weak, realizing that a rival with qual-\nity problems is unlikely to be aggressive in its competitive actions until it is able to correct those \nproblems.94 However, after correcting the problems, that competitor is likely to take aggressive \ncompetitive actions. \nA late mover is a firm that \nresponds to a competitive \naction a significant amount \nof time after the first mover’s \naction and the second \nmover’s response.\nQuality exists when \nthe firm’s products meet \nor exceed customers’ \nexpectations.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Utility companies are one of the key customers for large-scale \nbattery-storage products. They encounter the challenge of having \nsufficient capacity to meet peak demand for energy consumption. \nFor example, mornings and evenings are the times when custom-\ners use the greatest amounts of electricity. At non-peak times, utili-\nties have idle capacity. One way to resolve this problem is through \npumped-storage hydro plants that “store and generate energy by \nmoving water between two reservoirs at different elevations. During \ntimes of low electricity demand, such as at night or on weekends, \nexcess energy is used to pump water to an upper reservoir. The tur-\nbine acts as a pump, moving water back uphill. During periods of \nhigh electricity demand, the stored water is released through tur-\nbines.” However, not all utilities have the right environment or suffi-\ncient resources to participate in this type of energy storage.\nAlso, increasing levels of power generation from renewable energy \nsources such as wind and power require large-scale battery-storage \nunits. The challenge with wind and solar is that they are intermittent \nenergy sources. In this sense, power companies do not know exactly \nwhen the wind will blow (and for how long and at what velocity) and \nexactly when the sun will shine (and for how long and with what \ndegree of intensity). Large-scale storage batteries address this issue \nby allowing the capture of wind- and solar-generated power when \ncreated and then storing it until needed to meet consumer demand.\nThe decreasing cost of lithium-ion batteries is also increasing the \nattractiveness of large-scale, battery-storage systems—small versions \nof lithium-ion batteries power our cell phones and a host of other \nproducts. In addition, many companies are moving into the produc-\ntion of solid-state lithium-ion batteries that do not require liquid elec-\ntrolytes, charge faster, and are not combustible, which is a problem \nwith many batteries.\nTesla, Siemens AG, and General Electric (GE) are primary com-\npetitors in large-scale battery storage, and the three companies are \njockeying for position in this market. GE plans to invest $103 billion \ninto energy-storage projects by 2030. As one of these projects in \n2018, the company established a giant energy-storage platform \ncalled GE Reservoir. The platform is based on a modular, 20-foot-\nlong, high-capacity reservoir storage unit that can be combined \nwith other units. The platform allows storage of electricity gener-\nated by wind turbines and solar panels for later use. It also allows \nfor power grid optimization. In addition, GE Reservoir offers energy \nconsulting services, cost-benefit analysis, project planning, and ser-\nvice agreements.\nAnother of the big contenders, Tesla, in 2017 announced that in \npartnership with Neoen, a French renewable-energy provider, it would \nbuild, deliver, and install the world’s largest lithium battery to a loca-\ntion north of Jamestown, South Australia, in 100 days. Tesla fulfilled this \npromise and delivered a battery-storage product that runs constantly, \nprovides stability services for renewable-energy sources, and is avail-\nable for emergency backup power in case of an energy shortfall. \nTo compete with Tesla and GE, Siemens and AES combined their \nefforts to form an energy-storage start-up called Fluence Energy. \nThe partnership commenced operations in 2018 and immediately \nbecame the “supplier of AES’ Alamitos power center energy storage \nproject in Long Beach, California, serving Southern California Edison \nand the Western Los Angeles area. Fluence’s battery-storage project \nwas to be the largest in the world, exceeding the size of Tesla’s project \nin Southern Australia.” Then, in 2022, Fluence energy formed a part-\nnership with QuantumScape “to introduce solid-state lithium-based \nrechargeable batteries into stationary power applications.” \nThe attractiveness of the large-scale battery-storage market is \ndrawing in a lot of new investment capital. For example, Rondo Energy \nInc., a start-up based in the United States, raised $22 million in venture \nfunding to try to figure out how to store and use surplus energy from \nwind and solar to power heavy industry. Also, Carlyle Group made a \nhuge investment in a company called NineDot Energy in early 2022. \nNineDot is helping New York State achieve a goal of 100 percent \nclean energy by 2040. One of NineDot’s projects involves buying land \nand working with local utilities to connect batteries on those sites to \nthe power grid. These types of companies are likely to use existing  \nbattery-storage systems in the short term, but some of them will also \ninfluence the shape of this competitive market over time.\nSources: A.

As noted earlier, a competitive response is a strategic or tactical action the firm takes \nto counter the effects of a competitor’s action. In the Strategic Focus, we saw Siemens and AES \nworking together to form an energy-storage start-up in an effort to compete with Tesla and GE.\nIn general, a firm is likely to respond to a competitor’s action when one of the following is \nevident:\n\t\n●\nthe action leads to better use of the competitor’s capabilities to develop a stronger competitive \nadvantage or an improvement in its market position,\n\t\n●\nthe action damages the firm’s ability to use its core competencies to create or maintain an ad-\nvantage, or\n\t\n●\nthe firm’s market position becomes harder to defend.95\nIn addition to market commonality and resource similarity, and awareness, motivation, and \nability, firms evaluate three other factors—type of competitive action, actor’s reputation, and market \ndependence—to predict how a competitor is likely to respond to competitive actions (see Figure 5.2).\n5-6a Type of Competitive Action\nCompetitive responses to strategic actions differ from responses to tactical actions. These differ-\nences allow the firm to predict a competitor’s likely response to a competitive action that a firm \ntook against it. Strategic actions commonly receive strategic responses, and tactical actions receive \ntactical responses. In general, strategic actions elicit fewer total competitive responses because \nstrategic responses, such as market-based moves, involve a significant commitment of resources \nand are difficult to implement and reverse.96\nAnother reason that strategic actions elicit fewer responses than do tactical actions is that the \ntime needed to implement a strategic action and to assess its effectiveness can delay the compet-\nitor’s response to that action. In contrast, a competitor likely will respond quickly to a tactical \naction, such as when an airline company almost immediately matches a competitor’s tactical action \nof reducing prices in certain markets. Either strategic actions or tactical actions that target a large \nnumber of a rival’s customers are likely to elicit strong responses.97 In fact, if the effects of a com-\npetitor’s strategic action on the focal firm are significant (e.g., loss of market share, loss of major \nresources such as critical employees), a response is likely to be swift and strong.98\n5-6b Actor’s Reputation\nIn the context of competitive rivalry, an actor is the firm taking an action or a response, while \nreputation is “the positive or negative attribute ascribed by one rival to another based on past com-\npetitive behavior.”99 A positive reputation may be a source of above-average returns, especially for \nconsumer goods producers.100 Thus, a positive corporate reputation is of strategic value and affects \ncompetitive rivalry. To predict the likelihood of a competitor’s response to a current or planned \naction, firms evaluate the responses that the competitor took previously when attacked. In this way, \nfirms assume that past behavior predicts future behavior.101\nCompetitors are more likely to respond to strategic or tactical actions when market leaders \ntake them.102 In particular, evidence suggests that successful actions, especially strategic actions, \nare ones competitors will choose to imitate quickly. For example, although a second mover, IBM \ncommitted significant resources to enter the information service market. Competitors such as \nHewlett-Packard (HP), Dell Inc., and others responded with strategic actions to enter this market \nalso. As demonstrated in the Opening Case, Kroger and others responded quickly to market leader \nAmazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods.\nLearning Objective \n5-6 Explain factors \naffecting the likelihood \na firm will respond to \nactions its competitors \ntake.\nThe IBM brand has had a very strong, positive reputation for many years.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Lowe’s has been engaging in a number of competitive tactics recently to improve opera-\ntions and increase efficiency, leading one analyst to declare that “Lowe’s stole the edge away from \nHome Depot.”107 It is now up to Home Depot to respond.\nIn another battle, the Chinese Internet company ByteDance upended Meta Platforms (Face-\nbook) with its TikTok app becoming the most downloaded app in 2021. The app also overtook \nInstagram (also owned by Meta Platforms) as the most popular app among young users, which \nis a key market for both companies. In response, Meta launched its short-video product Reels for \nall Facebook users around the world, and also introduced many new features that are attractive to \nadvertisers. In addition, the company developed a number of new video-creation and monetiza-\ntion features. Meta reported that “video now accounts for more than half the time users spend on \nFacebook and Instagram.” 108\n5-7 Competitive Dynamics in Different \nTypes of Markets\nWhereas competitive rivalry concerns the ongoing actions and responses between a firm and its \ndirect competitors for an advantageous market position, competitive dynamics concerns the ongo-\ning actions and responses among all firms competing within a market for advantageous positions. \nThus, United and Delta engage in competitive rivalry, while the competitive actions and responses \ntaken by United, Delta, American, Southwest, British Airways, Lufthansa, and Emirates Airways \n(and many others) form the competitive dynamics of the airline passenger industry.\nTo explain competitive dynamics, we explore the effects of varying rates of competitive speed \nin different markets (called slow-cycle, fast-cycle, and standard-cycle markets) on the behavior \n(actions and responses) of all competitors within a given market. Competitive behaviors, as well as \nthe reasons for taking them, are somewhat similar within each market type, but differ across types \nof markets. Thus, competitive dynamics differ in slow-, fast-, and standard-cycle markets.\nAs noted in Chapter 1, firms want to sustain their competitive advantages for as long as possi-\nble, although no advantage is permanently sustainable. However, as we discuss next, the sustain-\nability of the firm’s competitive advantages differs by market type. How quickly competitors can \nimitate a rival’s competitive advantage and the cost to do so influences the sustainability of a focal \nfirm’s competitive advantage.\n5-7a Slow-Cycle Markets\nSlow-cycle markets are markets in which competitors lack the ability to imitate the focal firm’s \ncompetitive advantages, often because of the costs of imitation, so these advantages typically last \nfor long periods.109 Thus, firms may be able to sustain a competitive advantage over longer periods \nin slow-cycle markets.110 However, because no competitive advantage is permanently sustainable, \neven firms competing in slow-cycle markets can expect eventually to see a decline in the value their \ncompetitive advantage creates for target customers. \nThis was the case for Swiss watchmakers for decades. Relying largely on the competitive advan-\ntage of exclusivity that was a function of extreme precision in the manufacture of watches, these \ncompanies lacked effective competitors for many years. However, technological innovations such \nLearning Objective \n5-7 Describe competitive \ndynamics in slow-cycle, \nfast-cycle, and standard-\ncycle markets.\nSlow-cycle markets are \nmarkets in which competitors \nlack the ability to imitate \nthe focal firm’s competitive \nadvantages that commonly \nlast for long periods, and where \nimitation would be costly.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Their \ncompetitive advantage of exclusivity and the cachet of the term “Swiss Made” face challenges. In \nresponse, Swiss watchmakers are supporting efforts by Switzerland and the Federation of the Swiss \nWatch Industry group to fight counterfeiting of their products. Also, to attract younger customers, \nsome Swiss watchmakers are using artists and athletes as product ambassadors.111 \nBuilding a unique and proprietary capability produces a competitive advantage and success in a \nslow-cycle market. This type of advantage is difficult for competitors to imitate. As discussed in Chapter \n3, a difficult-to-understand and costly-to-imitate capability usually results from unique historical con-\nditions, causal ambiguity, and/or social complexity. Patents developed from superior R&D processes—a \nhuge source of competitive advantage in industries like pharmaceuticals—are examples of these types \nof capabilities.112 After a firm develops a proprietary advantage by using its capabilities, the competitive \nactions and responses it takes in a slow-cycle market are oriented to protecting, maintaining, and extend-\ning that advantage. Major strategic actions in these markets, such as acquisitions, usually carry less risk \nthan in faster-cycle markets.113 Clearly, firms that gain an advantage can grow more and earn higher \nreturns than those who simply track with the industry, especially in mature and declining industries.114 \nThe Walt Disney Company continues to extend its proprietary characters, such as Mickey \nMouse, Minnie Mouse, and Winnie the Pooh, to enhance the value its characters create for tar-\nget customers. These characters have a unique historical development because of Walt and Roy \nDisney’s creativity and vision for entertaining people. Products based on the characters seen in \nDisney’s animated films are available to customers to buy through Disney’s theme park shops, as \nwell as freestanding retail outlets called Disney Stores and online. Because copyrights shield it, the \nproprietary nature of Disney’s competitive advantage in terms of animated character trademarks \ncontinues to protect the firm from imitation by competitors.\nConsistent with another attribute of competition in a slow-cycle market, Disney protects its \nexclusive rights to its characters and their use. As with all firms competing in slow-cycle mar-\nkets, Disney’s competitive actions (such as building theme parks in France, Japan, and China) and \nresponses (such as lawsuits to protect its right to fully control use of its animated characters) main-\ntain and extend its proprietary competitive advantage while also protecting it.\nWe show the competitive dynamics generated by firms competing in slow-cycle markets in \nFigure 5.3. In slow-cycle markets, the firm launches a product (e.g., a new drug) it developed \nthrough a proprietary advantage (e.g., superior R&D process) and then exploits that advantage for \nas long as possible while the product’s uniqueness shields it from competition. Eventually, compet-\nitors respond to the action with a successful counterattack. In markets for drugs, this counterat-\ntack commonly occurs as patents expire or are broken through legal means, creating the need for \nanother product launch by the firm seeking a protected market position.\n5-7b Fast-Cycle Markets\nFast-cycle markets are markets in which competitors can imitate the focal firm’s capabilities that \ncontribute to its competitive advantages and where that imitation is often rapid and inexpensive.115 \nReturns from\na Sustained\nCompetitive\nAdvantage\nCounterattack\nExploitation\nLaunch\nTime (years)\n0\n5\n10\nFigure 5.3 Gradual Erosion of a Sustained Competitive Advantage\nFast-cycle markets are \nmarkets in which competitors \ncan imitate the focal firm’s \ncapabilities that contribute to \nits competitive advantages \nand where that imitation is \noften rapid and inexpensive.\nSource: Adapted from I.

This is a challenging task for \nmanagers and the organizations they lead.\nReverse engineering and the rate of technology diffusion facilitate the rapid imitation that takes place \nin fast-cycle markets.116 A competitor uses reverse engineering to gain quick access to the knowledge \nrequired to imitate or improve the firm’s products. Also, technology diffuses rapidly, making it available \nto competitors in a short period. The technology firms competing in fast-cycle markets use often is not \nproprietary, nor is it protected by patents as is the technology used by firms competing in slow-cycle \nmarkets. For example, only a few hundred parts, which are readily available on the open market, are \nrequired to build a PC. Patents protect only a few of these parts, such as microprocessor chips. However, \npotential entrants may hesitate to enter even a fast-cycle market when they know that the success of one \nor more firms competing in the market is a function of the ability to develop valuable patents.117\nFast-cycle markets are more volatile than slow- and standard-cycle markets. Indeed, the pace \nof competition in fast-cycle markets is almost frenzied as companies rely on innovations as growth \nengines. Because prices often decline quickly in these markets, companies need to profit rapidly \nfrom their product innovations.118 Recognizing this reality, firms avoid “loyalty” to any of their \nexisting products, preferring to cannibalize their own products before competitors learn how to do \nso through successful imitation. This emphasis creates competitive dynamics that differ substan-\ntially from those found in slow-cycle markets. Instead of concentrating on protecting, maintaining, \nand extending existing sources of competitive advantages, such as novel products, companies com-\npeting in fast-cycle markets focus on forming the capabilities and core competencies that will allow \nthem to develop new competitive advantages continuously and rapidly. \nIn some industries, cooperative strategies such as strategic alliances and joint ventures (see \nChapter 9) are a path to firms gaining access to new technologies that lead to introducing innovative \nproducts to the market.119 In recent years, many of these alliances have been offshore (with partners \nin foreign countries); gaining access to a partner’s capabilities at a lower cost is a key driver in such \ninstances. However, finding the balance between sharing knowledge and skills with a foreign part-\nner and preventing that partner from appropriating value from the focal firm’s contributions to the \nalliance can be challenging.120\nWe show the competitive behavior of firms competing in fast-cycle markets in Figure 5.4. Compet-\nitive dynamics in this market type entail actions and responses firms take to introduce products rapidly \nand continuously into the market. Flowing from an ability to do this is a stream of ever-changing competi-\ntive advantages for the firm. In this sense, the firm launches a product to achieve a competitive advantage \nand then exploits the advantage for as long as possible. However, the firm also tries to develop another \ncompetitive advantage before competitors can respond to the first one. Thus, competitive dynamics in \nfast-cycle markets often result in rapid product upgrades as well as quick product innovations.121\nTech giants Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings compete against each other in a range \nof mobile Internet businesses.

Largely because of a reduction in the growth in online users, \nthe rivalry between these firms is now more direct and intense as each firm seeks control over the \nconvergence of online and offline services. While competing aggressively with each other, Alibaba \nand Tencent will try to find innovative ways to serve customers. \nAs our discussion suggests, innovation plays a critical role in the competitive dynamics in \nfast-cycle markets. For individual firms, innovation is a key source of competitive advantage. \nThrough continuous and effective innovation, firms can cannibalize their own products  \nthrough innovations before competitors successfully imitate them, which may help them maintain \nan advantage through next-generation products.\n5-7c \nStandard-Cycle Markets\nStandard-cycle markets are markets in which some competitors may be able to imitate the focal \nfirm’s competitive advantages and where that imitation is moderately costly. Competitive advan-\ntages are partially sustainable in standard-cycle markets. However, this is the case only when a firm \ncan upgrade the quality of its capabilities continuously as a foundation for being able to remain \nahead of competitors. Firms initiate competitive actions and responses in standard-cycle markets \nto seek large market shares, to gain customer loyalty through brand names, and to control a firm’s \noperations carefully. When successful with these efforts, a firm consistently provides the same \npositive experiences to customers.123 \nCompanies competing in standard-cycle markets tend to serve many customers in what are \ntypically highly competitive markets. Because the capabilities and core competencies on which \nfirms competing in standard-cycle markets base their competitive advantages are less specialized, \nimitation is faster and less costly for standard-cycle firms than for those competing in slow-cycle \nmarkets. However, imitation is slower and more expensive in these markets than in fast-cycle \nmarkets. Thus, competitive dynamics in standard-cycle markets rest midway between the char-\nacteristics of dynamics in slow- and fast-cycle markets. Imitation comes less quickly and is more \nexpensive for firms competing in a standard-cycle market when a competitor is able to develop \neconomies of scale by combining coordinated and integrated design and manufacturing processes \nwith a large sales volume for its products.\nBecause of large volumes, the size of mass markets, and the need to develop scale economies, the \ncompetition for market share is intense in standard-cycle markets. This form of competition is read-\nily evident in the battles among consumer foods’ producers, such as candy makers and major com-\npetitors Hershey Co., Nestlé, SA, Mondelēz International, Inc. (the name for the former Kraft Foods \nInc.), and Mars. The dimensions on which these competitors compete as a means of increasing their \nshare of the candy market include taste and the ingredients used to develop it, advertising cam-\npaigns, package designs, and product availability through different distribution channels.124 Recent \nyears found candy manufacturers contending with criticism from health professionals about the \nsugar, saturated fats, and calories their products provide. These criticisms revolve around the neg-\native effects on individuals’ health caused by the ingredients used to manufacture candy products. \nInnovation can also drive competitive actions and responses in standard-cycle markets, espe-\ncially when rivalry is intense. As explained in the Opening Case, we can anticipate innovation in \ndistribution channels and in the use of data analytics to take place in the retail grocery industry \nas Amazon, Walmart, and others engage in competitive battles with traditional brick-and-mortar \noperators such as Kroger and Albertsons. Some innovations in standard-cycle markets are incre-\nmental rather than radical. (We discuss incremental and radical innovations in Chapter 13.) Both \ntypes of innovation, though, are critical to firms’ efforts to achieve strategic competitiveness when \ncompeting in standard-cycle markets.\nOverall, innovation has a substantial influence on competitive dynamics as it affects the actions \nand responses of all companies competing within a slow-, fast-, or standard-cycle market. In previ-\nous chapters, we emphasized the importance of innovation to the firm’s strategic competitiveness. \nIn our discussion of strategic entrepreneurship in Chapter 13, we again emphasize this relationship \nand its importance. These discussions highlight the critical role innovation plays for firms, regard-\nless of the type of competitive rivalry and competitive dynamics they encounter.\nStandard-cycle markets \nare markets in which some \ncompetitors may be able \nto imitate the focal firm’s \ncompetitive advantages \nand where that imitation is \nmoderately costly.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Competitive rivalry is the ongoing set of \ncompetitive actions and responses occurring between \ncompetitors as they compete against each other for an \nadvantageous market position. The outcomes of com-\npetitive rivalry influence the firm’s ability to develop \nand then sustain its competitive advantages and the \nlevel (average, below average, or above average) of its \nfinancial returns.\n \n● Competitive behavior is the set of competitive actions \nand responses an individual firm takes while engaged \nin competitive rivalry. Competitive dynamics is the set \nof actions and responses taken by all firms that are \ncompetitors within a particular market.\n \n● Firms study competitive rivalry to predict the compet-\nitive actions and responses each of their competitors \nare likely to take. Competitive actions are either stra-\ntegic, tactical, or non-market. Non-market strategies \nfocus on altering a firm’s institutional environment as \na part of its competitive strategy. Government-focused \nnon-market strategies are political and attempt to \nchange the industry architecture, or the “rules of the \ngame.” The firm takes competitive actions to defend \nor build its competitive advantages or to improve \nits market position. Firms engage in competitive \nresponses to counter the effects of a competitor’s \ncompetitive actions. \n \n● A strategic action or a strategic response requires a \nsignificant commitment of organizational resources, \nis difficult to implement successfully, and is difficult \nto reverse. In contrast, a tactical action or a tactical \nresponse requires fewer organizational resources and \nis easier to implement and reverse. For example, for \nan airline company, entering major new markets is an \nexample of a strategic action or a strategic response; \nchanging ticket prices in a particular market is an \nexample of a tactical action or a tactical response.\n \n● A competitor analysis is the first step the firm takes \nto be able to predict its competitors’ actions and \nresponses. In Chapter 2, we discussed what firms do to \nunderstand competitors. We extended this discussion \nin this chapter to describe what the firm does to pre-\ndict competitors’ market-based actions. Thus, under-\nstanding precedes prediction. Firms study market \ncommonality (the number of markets with which com-\npetitors are involved jointly and their importance to \neach) and resource similarity (how comparable com-\npetitors’ resources are in terms of type and amount) to \ncomplete a competitor analysis. In general, the greater \nthe market commonality and resource similarity, the \nmore firms intense is the competitive rivalry.\n \n● Market commonality and resource similarity shape the \nfirm’s awareness (the degree to which it and its com-\npetitors understand their mutual interdependence), \nmotivation (the firm’s incentive to attack or respond), \nand ability (the quality of the resources available to \nthe firm to attack and respond). Having knowledge \nof these characteristics of a competitor increases the \nquality of the firm’s predictions about that competi-\ntor’s actions and responses. A firm with greater mul-\ntipoint contact is less likely to initiate an attack, but \nmore likely to respond aggressively when attacked.\n \n● In addition to market commonality, resource similarity, \nawareness, motivation, and ability, three more specific \nfactors affect the likelihood a competitor will take \ncompetitive actions. The first of these is first-mover \nbenefits. First movers, those taking an initial com-\npetitive action, often gain loyal customers and earn \nabove-average returns until competitors can respond \nsuccessfully to their action. Not all firms can be first \nmovers because they may lack the awareness, motiva-\ntion, or ability required to engage in this type of com-\npetitive behavior. Moreover, some firms prefer to be a \nsecond mover (the firm responding to the first mov-\ner’s action). By evaluating the first mover’s product, \ncustomers’ reactions to it, and the responses of other \ncompetitors to the first mover, the second mover may \nbe able to avoid the early entrant’s mistakes and find \nways to improve upon the value created for custom-\ners by the first mover’s product. Late movers (those \nthat respond a long time after the original action was \ntaken) typically are less competitive.\n \n● Organizational size tends to reduce the variety of \ncompetitive actions that large firms launch, while \nit increases the variety of actions smaller competi-\ntors undertake. However, because of the amount of \nresources it possesses, a large firm may initiate a larger \nnumber of actions when engaging in competitive \nrivalry. Another factor, quality, is a base denominator \nfor competing successfully in the global economy \nand for achieving competitive parity, at a minimum. \nQuality refers to the quality of a firm’s products as well \nas its management since the companies of weak CEOs \nare more likely to be attacked through competitive \nactions. Quality is a necessary but insufficient condi-\ntion for establishing an advantage.\n \n● To predict a competitor’s response to its actions, a \nfirm examines the type of action (strategic or tactical) \nit took, the competitor’s reputation for the nature of \nits competitor behavior, and that competitor’s depen-\ndence on the market in which the focal firm took \naction. Competitors respond more frequently to the \nactions taken by the firm with a reputation for predict-\nable and understandable competitive behavior, espe-\ncially if that firm is a market leader. In general, the firm \ncan predict that when its competitor is highly depen-\ndent on its revenue and profitability in the market in \nwhich the firm took a competitive action, that com-\npetitor is likely to launch a strong response. However, \nfirms with greater diversification across markets are \nless likely to respond to a particular action that affects \nonly one of the markets in which they compete.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In fast-cycle markets, competition is substan-\ntial as firms concentrate on developing a series of \ntemporary competitive advantages. This emphasis \nis necessary because firms’ advantages in fast-cycle \nmarkets are not proprietary; as such, they are sub-\nject to rapid and relatively inexpensive imitation. \nStandard-cycle markets have a level of competition \nbetween that in slow- and fast-cycle markets; firms \noften (but not always) have a moderate amount of \nprotection from competition in standard-cycle mar-\nkets as they use capabilities that produce competitive \nadvantages with some sustainability. Competitors \nin standard-cycle markets serve mass markets and \ntry to develop economies of scale to enhance their \nprofitability. Innovation is vital to competitive success \nin each of the three types of markets. Companies \nshould recognize that the set of competitive actions \nand responses taken by all firms differs by type of \nmarket.\nKey Terms\ncompetitive action 116\ncompetitive behavior 115\ncompetitive dynamics 115\ncompetitive response 116\ncompetitive rivalry 114\ncompetitors 114\nfast-cycle markets 128\nfirst mover 122\nlate mover 124\nmarket commonality 120\nmultipoint competition 115\nnon-market strategies 116\nquality 124\nresource similarity 120\nsecond mover 123\nslow-cycle markets 127\nstandard-cycle markets 130\nstrategic action or strategic response 116\ntactical action or tactical response 116\nReview Questions\n1.

In standard-cycle markets?\nMini-Case\nDifferent Responses of Incumbent Hotels to the Threat from Airbnb\nThe hotel industry was one of the most affected by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The American Hotel & Lodging \nAssociation estimates that the U.S. hotel industry lost over \n$118 billion in room revenue as a result of the pandemic. In \n2021, the industry began to re-emerge, “fueled by national \nvaccine distribution and consumer optimism.” For example, \nin the United States, 2022 room revenues were projected \nto be approximately $168 billion, which is almost the same \nas room revenues in 2019. Occupancy rates in 2022 were \nexpected to be about 63.4 percent, compared to 66.0 percent \nin 2019. \nNonetheless, new variants of COVID-19 continue to \nprovide a high level of uncertainty. Also, staffing shortages \nare plaguing the industry. In addition, high levels of infla-\ntion mean that although a nominal recovery may occur, it is \nlikely to take many years for the industry to fully recover. The \nindustry is also experiencing an increase in what industry \nexperts call “bileisure travel” that blends business and leisure \ntravel. “Consumers’ motivations, behaviors, and expectations \nall shifted during the pandemic—profoundly changing how \nhotels operate to satisfy their guests, who are increasingly \nlikely to be leisure or bileisure travelers or digital nomads.  \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Globally, Marriott \nInternational is the largest hotel company, with $13.9 billion in \nrevenues in 2021. Hilton is next, followed by InterContinental \nHotels Group PLC and Hyatt Hotels Corp. Each of these \ncompanies has multiple hotel brands that vary from elite to \ndiscount. For example, Marriott has its brand name hotels in \naddition to Sheraton, Westin, The Ritz-Carlton, Renaissance \nHotel, Fairfield, and others. These large hotel companies \nmanage, franchise, and license hotels as well as residential \nand timeshare properties. Consequently, they engage in a \nhigh level of multipoint competition.\nIn addition to a high level of rivalry among the biggest \ncompetitors, and difficulties in dealing with COVID-19 \nuncertainties, the embattled hotel industry has lost demand \ndue to an increasingly popular online alternative to tradi-\ntional hotels. “One emerging issue in the lodging industry is \nthe rise of online room sharing business models. Airbnb, the \nmost successful room sharing platform, allows people to rent \nout their residences for short-term tourist purposes and has \ndisrupted the hotel industry.” One study found that for each \n1,000 Airbnb listings, the occupancy rates for hotels declined \nby an average 3.9 percent. The decline was much greater in \nlow-quality hotels than high-quality hotels.\nA study was conducted to determine how incum-\nbent hotels responded to the entry of Airbnb in their mar-\nkets. They responded differently, depending on their busi-\nness-level strategies. Low-quality hotels (low-cost leaders) \nresponded by reducing their room prices and investments \nin service quality, whereas high-quality hotels (differentia-\ntors) increased their prices and service quality “to reposition \nthemselves in the higher end of the lodging market.” These \ndifferential responses reflect a tendency for firms to amplify \ntheir strategies when they are under attack. One thing is \ncertain—in the highly volatile and competitive hotel industry, \nsustaining strategic competitiveness is difficult.\nSources: H.-H. Chang & D. D.

What is the state of competitive rivalry in the hotel \nindustry? What are some factors firms use as a basis \nfor competition?\n2. How can new technologies such as artificial intelli-\ngence or virtual reality be used competitively by  \nthe large, traditional hotel companies in this  \nindustry?\n3. What competitive advantages do traditional hotel \ncompanies have relative to room sharing platforms \nlike Airbnb? Are these advantages sustainable?\n4. In a competitive rivalry sense, explain what additional \nactions (strategic and/or tactical) you believe Marriott \nor one of the other large hotel companies might take \nin response to the rise of room-sharing platforms like \nAirbnb. \nNotes\n1.

Over \na century and dozens of acquisitions later, the 30 operating companies of the \nTata Group are now leaders in India in 10 different business areas. The combined \nmarket capitalization of Tata companies was equivalent to $242 billion in U.S. \ndollars in March 2021, and combined revenues were $103 billion in 2020–2021. \nTata Group companies employ more than 800,000 people. Tata Sons Private Ltd. \nis a private entity that owns most of the shares in the Tata Group of companies; \nhowever, each of the public companies operates independently and has its own \nboard of directors. The chairperson of Tata Sons is usually the chairperson of the \nTata Group.\nAmong the most globally influential of the Tata Group of companies is Tata \nConsultancy Services (TCS), which provides information technology (IT) services \nand consulting to many of the world’s largest businesses. Around the turn of the \npresent century, TCS started offering low-cost data processing services to  \nWestern companies, which significantly impacted the increase in offshoring of \ninformation technology services to India. For example, a lot of customer service \ncalls are now routed to In-\ndia, where specially trained \nservice representatives \nprovide service to custom-\ners at very low cost. \nAnother huge part of \nthe Tata Group is Tata \nMotors, a leading global \nautomobile manufacturer \nthat produces cars, buses, \ntrucks, and defense vehi-\ncles. In addition to its own \nTata brand of vehicles, Tata \nowns the prestigious Jag-\nuar and Land Rover brands. \nIn an entirely different type \nof industry, Tata Steel, with \nan annual steel production \ncapacity of 33 million tons \nper year, is known for its success in digitalizing its business operations, as well as \nthe flexibility and customer focus it exhibited through all of the other changes \nthat have taken place in India over the past half century. \nTata Chemicals is also part of the group. Heavily engaged in scientific research, \nTata Chemicals produces both basic and specialty chemical products. Another of the \nTata companies is Titan, a leading manufacturer of watches, jewelry, and eyewear. \nAlso, Tata Power is the largest integrated power company in India, involved in con-\nventional and renewable energy and applications such as solar rooftop panels and \nelectrical vehicle charging stations. In addition, Tata Consumer Products produces \nfood and beverage products (i.e., noodles, ready-to-eat meals, tea, coffee, mineral \nwater) and has a presence in 50 countries. The list of Tata companies goes on and on.\nDespite the wide variety of businesses in the Tata Group portfolio, the con-\nglomerate is not done diversifying yet. In January of 2022, Tata Sons completed \ntheir purchase of Air India for 180 billion rupees, the equivalent of $2.4 billion. The \nmoney-losing airline was previously owned and operated by the government. It is \na part of India’s push to privatize businesses. Airline industry analysts predict that \nthe Indian travel market is set for expansion as COVID-19 restrictions loosen, so this \ncould end up being a very profitable investment in the future. The Tata family intends \nto restore Air India to its previous glory as “one of the most prestigious airlines in \nthe world.” This acquisition is especially significant because Air India was previously \nowned by Tata, and then the Indian government took over the airline in 1953.\nSources:  2022, Tata Group Homepage, www.tata.com, March 4; P.

In this chapter, we introduce you to corporate-level strategies, which \nare strategies firms use to diversify their operations from a single business competing in a single \nmarket into several product markets and businesses. Thus, a corporate-level strategy specifies \nactions a firm takes to gain a competitive advantage by selecting and managing a group of differ-\nent businesses competing in different product markets.1 Corporate-level strategies help companies \nto select new strategic positions—positions that are expected to increase the firm’s value.2 As \nexplained in the opening case, Tata Group competes in a number of unrelated industries—a strat-\negy called unrelated diversification.\nBefore moving forward, it is important to explain that because a diversified firm operates in two \nor more different businesses, it devises two types of strategies: corporate-level (company-wide) and \nbusiness-level (competitive).3 Consistent with the definition provided previously, corporate-level \nstrategy is concerned with two key issues: in what product markets and businesses the firm should \ncompete and how corporate headquarters should manage those businesses.4 For the diversified \ncompany, a business-level strategy (see Chapter 4) must be selected for each of the businesses in \nwhich the firm has decided to compete. This means that a firm can have more than one type of \nbusiness-level strategy operating within its portfolio of businesses.\nAs is the case with a business-level strategy, a corporate-level strategy is expected to help the firm \nearn above-average returns by creating value for stakeholders.5 Some suggest that few corporate-level \nstrategies actually create additional value beyond what the various businesses would create if they \nwere operating on their own.6 In other words, a corporate-level strategy’s value is ultimately deter-\nmined by the degree to which the businesses in the portfolio perform better under the management \nof the diversified company than they would if they operated independently, a phenomenon referred \nas a “corporate parenting advantage.”7 Thus, an effective corporate-level strategy creates, across all of \na firm’s businesses, aggregate returns that exceed what those returns would be without the strategy \nand contributes to the firm’s strategic competitiveness and its ability to earn above-average returns.8\nProduct diversification, a primary form of corporate-level strategy, concerns the scope of the \nmarkets and industries in which the firm competes. Successful diversification is expected to reduce \nvariability in the firm’s profitability as earnings are generated from different businesses instead of \nrelying on only one.9 Diversification can also provide firms with the flexibility to shift their invest-\nments to markets where the greatest returns are possible rather than being dependent on only one \nor a few markets.10 However, diversified firms incur additional costs because of the extra monitor-\ning and management required. For example, a corporate-level strategy requires some amount of \ncorporate-level management to allocate resources among the various markets and businesses, as \nwell as to measure their performance and reward their managers.11 The ideal portfolio of businesses \nbalances diversification’s costs and benefits.\nWe begin this chapter by examining different levels of diversification (from low to high). After \ndescribing the different reasons firms diversify their operations, we focus on two types of related diver-\nsification, which occurs when the businesses in a firm’s portfolio have a common feature such as a \nsimilar customer, technology, or distribution channel. When properly used, these strategies help create \nvalue in the diversified firm, either through the sharing of resources (the related constrained strategy) \nor the transferring of core competencies across the firm’s different businesses (the related linked strat-\negy). We then examine unrelated diversification, which is the corporate-level strategy demonstrated in \nthe opening case on Tata Group. Thereafter, the chapter shifts to incentives and resources that stimu-\nlate diversification. Some of the reasons for diversification can actually destroy some of the firm’s value.\n6-2 Levels of Diversification Through  \nCorporate-Level Strategies\nDiversified firms vary according to their levels of diversification and the connections between and \namong their businesses. Figure 6.1 lists and defines five categories of businesses according to increas-\ning levels of diversification. The single- and dominant-business categories denote no or relatively low \nLearning Objective\n6-1 Define corporate-\nlevel strategy and discuss \nits purpose.\nLearning Objective\n6-2 Describe different \nlevels of diversification \nachieved using different \ncorporate-level \nstrategies.\nA corporate-level strategy \nspecifies actions a firm \ntakes to gain a competitive \nadvantage by selecting and \nmanaging a group of different \nbusinesses competing in \ndifferent product markets.\nPart 2: Strategic Actions: Strategy Formulation\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

A firm is related through its diversification when its businesses share several links. For example, \ntwo or more businesses in a firm’s portfolio may share product markets (goods or services), technolo-\ngies (know-how), or distribution channels. The more links among businesses, the more “constrained” \nis the level of diversification. “Unrelated” refers to the absence of direct links between businesses.\n6-2a Low Levels of Diversification\nA firm pursuing a low level of diversification uses either a single- or a dominant-business diversifi-\ncation strategy. A single-business diversification strategy is a corporate-level strategy wherein the firm \ngenerates 95 percent or more of its sales revenue from its core business area.12 For example, McIlhenny \nCompany, headquartered on Avery Island in Louisiana and producer of Tabasco brand, has maintained \nits focus on its family’s hot sauce products for seven generations. Historically, McIlhenny has used a \nsingle-business strategy while operating with relatively few products and maintaining a very wide global \nmarket presence. Tabasco brand sauce is “Labeled in 36 languages and dialects, sold in over 195 coun-\ntries and territories, added to soldiers’ rations and put on restaurant tables around the globe.”13 Although \nthe company has begun to partner with other firms—the Tabasco taste can be found in a variety of \nfood products, such as Jelly Bean candies or crackers—it is still considered a single-business company.\nWith the dominant-business diversification strategy, the firm generates between 70 and 95 percent \nof its total revenue within a single business area. United Parcel Service (UPS), the largest package \ndelivery company, uses this strategy. Recently, UPS generated 82 percent of its revenue from its pack-\nage delivery business (United States and international) and 18 percent from its nonpackaged busi-\nness.14 One of its nonpackaged businesses, healthcare logistics, is an area in which UPS sees tremen-\ndous growth potential. Although this is a separate business for reporting purposes, UPS is not straying \nfar from its main business and is still able to apply its core competency in transportation management.\nFirms that focus on one or very few businesses can earn positive returns because they are able to \ndevelop capabilities useful for these markets and can therefore provide superior products and services \nto their customers. Additionally, there are fewer challenges in managing one or a very small set of busi-\nnesses, allowing them to gain economies of scale and efficiently use their resources.15 Family-owned \nand controlled businesses, such as McIlhenny Company’s Tabasco sauce business, are commonly less \ndiversified. They tend to prefer the narrower focus because the family’s reputation is related closely to \nthat of the business. They may also prefer to distribute earnings as dividends rather than invest them in \nnew diversified businesses.16\nFigure 6.1 Levels and Types of Diversification\nLow Levels of Diversiﬁcation\n \nSingle business: \n95% or more of revenue comes from a\n \n \nsingle business.\n \nDominant business: \nBetween 70% and 95% of revenue\n \n \ncomes from a single business.\nModerate to High Levels of Diversiﬁcation\n \nRelated constrained: \nLess than 70% of revenue comes \n \n \nfrom the dominant business, and \n \n \nall businesses share product,\n \n \ntechnological, and distribution\n \n \nlinkages.\n \nRelated linked \nLess than 70% of revenue comes from\n \n(mixed related and \nthe dominant business, and there are\n \nunrelated): \nonly limited links between businesses.\nVery High Levels of Diversiﬁcation\n \nUnrelated: \nLess than 70% of revenue comes from\n \n \nthe dominant business, and there are\n \n \nno common links between businesses.\nA\nC\nA\nB\nA\nB\nC\nA\nB\nC\nA\nB\nSources: Adapted from R.

Because all of the firm’s \nbusinesses share product technological and distribution linkages, \nCampbell’s corporate-level strategy is classified as related constrained. \nThe Meals and Beverages segment (54 percent of sales) includes “retail \nand foodservice businesses in the U.S. and Canada” and the Snacks \nsegment (46 percent of sales) includes “cookies, crackers, fresh bak-\nery and frozen products” in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and, until \nrecently, Europe. Soup accounts for over half of the sales in the Meals \nand Beverages segment.\nIn Campbell’s Annual Report for 2021, Mark Clouse, president \nand chief executive officer, described Campbell’s business portfolio \nthis way, “Campbell’s brands play an important part of the meals and \nsnacks enjoyed every day across North America. Breakfasts often start \nwith Pepperidge Farm breads, and kids of all ages hope to find Goldfish \ncrackers in their lunches. Grilled cheese sandwiches and Campbell’s \nTomato Soup are the classic lunch combo. Campbell’s condensed \ncooking soups, Swanson and Pacific Foods broths are used to cre-\nate memorable family dinners. Friends reach for Kettle Brand chips or \nSnyder’s of Hanover pretzels while watching their favorite games. Kids \nsnack on Lance crackers in the dugout during Little League, and of \ncourse moms enjoy a Milano moment. Clearly, we have a unique and \ndifferentiated portfolio filled with iconic, fabric-of-the-nation brands \nthat consumers love.”\nRelatedness among these products provides ample opportunities \nfor sharing of resources and capabilities. Marketing expertise gained \nin the Meals and Beverages segment can be used to help market \nproducts in the Snacks segment. Distribution knowledge and chan-\nnels can be used across the segments. Campbell’s core competency in \npre-packaged food science is applicable in both units. Also, Campbell \nis a master at managing iconic brand names, which is another core \ncompetency that can be used in snacks or meals and beverages.\nCampbell is actively adding to, and removing products from, its \nportfolio in an effort to increase growth and efficiency and to adjust \nfor changes in the consumer foods market. For example, in 2018 \nCampbell acquired Pacific Foods of Oregon and Snyder’s-Lance. Then, \nin 2019, the company sold its refrigerated soup business, its Garden \nFresh Gourmet business, and Bolthouse Farms. To focus more on its \ncore U.S. segment, Campbell also sold several businesses in Australia, \nAsia Pacific, and Europe. In 2021, the company sold its Plum baby food \nand snacks business.\nTo take even better advantage of the efficiencies from relatedness \nacross the two business segments, Campbells sometimes transfers \na product into the other division. For instance, starting in 2022, the \nfoodservice and Canadian portion of the Snacks segment will be \nmanaged within the Meals and Beverages segment. The company is \nalso making changes in response to customer preferences. Campbell \nis removing high fructose corn syrup from all of its condensed soups, \npromoting their affordability as consumers deal with inflation, and is \ncommitted to making all of its containers recyclable by 2030. High \ninflation, labor shortages, and supply-chain issues were depressing \nsales in 2022, but Campbell was optimistic because of what the com-\npany saw as an improving labor market, and also expected that price \nincreases would help mitigate inflation.\nSources: F.

When the links between the diversified firm’s businesses are rather direct—meaning they \nuse similar sourcing, throughput, and outbound processes—it is a related constrained diversifica-\ntion strategy. Caterpillar, Proctor & Gamble, and Merck & Co. use a related constrained strategy. \nCampbell Soup, featured in the Strategic Focus, also uses this strategy. With a related constrained \nstrategy, a firm shares resources and activities across its businesses. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Similar inputs, distribution channels, technologies, and customers \nallow Campbell to enjoy operating efficiencies and high growth potential. A product proliferation \nstrategy like the one Campbell uses represents a form of within-industry diversification that can \nlead to higher performance.17 \nA diversified company with a portfolio of businesses that have only a few links between them \nis pursuing a mix between a related and unrelated diversification strategy, a corporate-level strat-\negy called the related linked diversification strategy (see Figure 6.1). General Electric (GE), famous \nfor making everything from lightbulbs to jet engines, used a related-linked diversification strat-\negy for many years. Compared with related constrained firms, related linked firms share fewer \nresources and assets between their businesses, concentrating instead on transferring knowledge \nand core competencies between the businesses. GE had four strategic business units, each com-\nposed of related businesses. There were few relationships across the strategic business units, but \nmany among the subsidiaries or divisions within them. \nIn the past several years, General Electric (GE) experienced serious setbacks, including prob-\nlems in its oil and gas services as well as its power equipment businesses. GE also suffered signif-\nicant revenue declines in its financial services businesses and subsequently sold its assets in that \narea. Then, in late 2021, GE announced plans to split into three separate companies: healthcare, \naviation, and power and renewables.18 This division was possible because GE’s related linked diver-\nsification strategy created what were already essentially three companies within one company.\nA highly diversified firm that has no strategically relevant relationships between its businesses \nfollows an unrelated diversification strategy. In addition to Tata Group, United Technologies Cor-\nporation, Textron, and Samsung are examples of firms using this type of corporate-level strategy. \nThese types of firms are often called conglomerates.19 Newell Brands Inc. has a number of con-\nsumer businesses that are not very related to each other. It has over 100 brands, including Rubber-\nmaid household products, Coleman camping equipment, Yankee Candle, First Alert fire detectors, \nElmer’s glue, and Nuk pacifiers.20 Successfully managing the unrelated diversification strategy can \nbe difficult, and Newell has struggled in recent years to satisfy investors and gain respect from ana-\nlysts.21 However, after years of sluggish growth and disappointing earnings, the company has made \nsome progress with a major turnaround strategy that is focusing on innovation. Newell was named \nto Fortune’s 2022 World’s Most Admired Companies list, sitting at number 224.22 \nAnother form of unrelated diversification strategy is pursued by private equity firms such Car-\nlyle Group, Blackstone (see Mini-Case at the end of the chapter), and KKR & Co.23 These firms \namass a large amount of investment capital from institutional investors (i.e., pension funds) and \nhigh-new-worth individuals and use it to acquire equity ownership of companies. Large, private \nequity firms like these often have a portfolio of firms that have little in common with each other.\n6-3 Reasons for Diversification\nA firm uses a corporate-level diversification strategy for a variety of reasons (see Table 6.1). The broad \nobjective of a diversification strategy is to increase the firm’s value by improving its overall perfor-\nmance.24 Value is created when the firm’s corporate-level strategy helps the firm do better in imple-\nmenting its business-level strategies, either by increasing revenues or reducing costs within those \nbusiness units.25 One way to do this is to pursue synergies through sharing tangible (i.e., raw mate-\nrials, distribution channels, plants) or intangible (i.e., knowledge, technologies, patents) resources \nacross those business units. Synergy exists when the value created by business units working together \nexceeds the value that those same units create working independently.26 This type of synergy comes \nfrom economies of scope, which are economic factors that lead to cost savings through successfully \nsharing resources and capabilities or transferring one or more corporate-level core competencies that \nwere developed in one of a firm’s businesses to another of its businesses.27 \nA firm may use diversification to increase market power by reducing costs below the levels of \nclose competitors or increasing the firm’s ability to charge a price that is higher than competitors. \nAlternatively, a firm may increase its market power through producing inputs for its value creation \nsystem that were previously bought from other companies. This type of action is called backward \nvertical integration. A firm can also vertically integrate forward by becoming its own customer for \nsome of its products or services.\nLearning Objective\n6-3 Explain the reasons \nfirms diversify.\nSynergy exists when the \nvalue created by business units \nworking together exceeds the \nvalue that those same units \ncreate working independently.\nEconomies of scope are \neconomic factors that lead \nto cost savings through \nsuccessfully sharing resources \nand capabilities or transferring \none or more corporate-level \ncore competencies that were \ndeveloped in one of a firm’s \nbusinesses to another of its \nbusinesses.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In addition, a firm may be \nable to create more value through restructuring its business portfolio by adding additional businesses \nor divesting those that are not high performing. As we saw in the Strategic Focus, Campbell Soup \nCompany recently acquired Pacific Foods of Oregon and Snyder’s-Lance, and then sold its refriger-\nated soup business, its Garden Fresh Gourmet business, and Bolthouse Farms in the next year.\nOther reasons for using a diversification strategy may not be closely tied to increasing the firm’s \nvalue. Rather, the firm may be adapting to changes in the external environment (i.e., antitrust \nlegislation, tax law changes), responding to low performance, or trying to address uncertain cash \nflows. We will refer to these as value-neutral reasons for diversification. There are even reasons for \ndiversification that can reduce firm value. Decisions to expand a firm’s portfolio of businesses to \nreduce managerial employment risk can negatively affect the firm’s value. The type of managerial \nrisk we are discussing refers to employment risk—the risk of job loss.29 Also, since the CEOs of \nlarger firms tend to receive higher compensation, a CEO may promote higher levels of diversifica-\ntion to enhance their own welfare.\nThese value-creating, value-neutral, and value-reducing reasons for diversification will now be \ndiscussed in greater detail. \n6-4 Value-Creating Diversification:  \nRelated Constrained and Related  \nLinked Diversification\nWith a related diversification corporate-level strategy (related constrained or related linked), the \nfirm builds upon or extends its resources and capabilities to build a competitive advantage by cre-\nating value for customers.30 The company using a related diversification strategy wants to develop \nand exploit economies of scope between its businesses.31 In fact, even nonprofit organizations have \nfound that carefully planned and implemented related diversification can create value.32\nLearning Objective\n6-4 Describe how firms \ncan create value by using \na related diversification \nstrategy. \nTable 6.1 Reasons for Diversification\nValue-Creating Diversification\n \n●\nEconomies of scope (related diversification)\n \n●\nSharing activities\n \n●\nTransferring core competencies\n \n●\nMarket power (related diversification)\n \n●\nBlocking competitors through multipoint competition\n \n●\nVertical integration\n \n●\nFinancial economies (unrelated diversification)\n \n●\nEfficient internal capital allocation\n \n●\nBusiness restructuring\nValue-Neutral Diversification\n \n●\nAntitrust regulation\n \n●\nTax laws\n \n●\nLow performance\n \n●\nUncertain future cash flows\n \n●\nRisk reduction for firm\n \n●\nTangible resources\n \n●\nIntangible resources\nValue-Reducing Diversification\n \n●\nDiversifying managerial employment risk\n \n●\nIncreasing managerial compensation\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The firm with a strong capability \nin managing operational synergy, especially in sharing assets between its businesses, falls in the upper- \nleft quadrant, which also represents vertical sharing of assets through vertical integration. The lower- \nright quadrant represents a highly developed corporate capability for transferring one or more core \ncompetencies across businesses. This capability is located primarily in the corporate headquarters \noffice. Unrelated diversification is also illustrated in Figure 6.2 in the lower-left quadrant. Financial \neconomies, rather than either operational or corporate relatedness, are the source of value creation for \nfirms using the unrelated diversification strategy. This section focuses on operational and corporate \nrelatedness. Financial economies will be discussed in the section on unrelated diversification.\nAs illustrated in Figure 6.2, firms seek to create value from economies of scope through two \nbasic kinds of operational economies: sharing activities (operational relatedness) and transferring \ncorporate-level core competencies (corporate relatedness).34 The difference between sharing activ-\nities and transferring competencies is based on how separate resources are jointly used to create \neconomies of scope. To create economies of scope, tangible resources such as plants and equip-\nment or other business-unit physical assets often must be shared. Less tangible resources, such as \nmanufacturing know-how and technological capabilities, can also be shared. However, know-how \ntransferred between separate activities with no physical or tangible resource involved is a transfer \nof a corporate-level core competence, not an operational sharing of activities.35\n6-4a Operational Relatedness: Sharing Activities\nFirms can create operational relatedness by sharing either a primary activity, such as an inventory \ndelivery system, or a support activity, such as human resource management (see discussion of \nthe value chain in Chapter 3). Firms using the related constrained diversification strategy share \nactivities like these in an effort to create additional value for stakeholders. Proctor & Gamble, a \nconsumer goods company, uses this corporate-level strategy across its personal care line of prod-\nucts such as its Gillette razors and Braun personal grooming products.36 Caterpillar also shares \nactivities. For example, most of Caterpillar’s businesses share marketing activities because their \nequipment is sold to firms in the construction and mineral extraction industries.37 \nOperational relatedness \nprovides opportunities to \nshare resources among the \noperational activities of the \nfirm.\nCorporate relatedness \nprovides opportunities \nfor transferring corporate-\nlevel competencies across \nbusinesses of the firm.\nFigure 6.2 Value-Creating Diversification Strategies: Operational and Corporate Relatedness\nRelated Constrained\nDiversification\nBoth Operational and\nCorporate Relatedness\nUnrelated\nDiversification\nLow\nHigh\nHigh\nLow\nOperational\nRelatedness:\nSharing\nActivities\nbetween\nBusinesses\nRelated Linked\nDiversification\nCorporate Relatedness: \nTransferring Core Competencies into Businesses \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

One type of tangible resource is the \nplant and equipment necessary to produce a product; \nhowever, this type of tangible resource tends to be less \nflexible than other types because, typically, a plant and \nequipment can only be shared if the products are closely \nrelated, especially those requiring highly similar manu-\nfacturing technologies. \nExcess capacity of other tangible resources, such as \na sales force, can be used to diversify more easily. Excess \nsales force capacity is more effective with related diversi-\nfication because it can be utilized to sell products in sim-\nilar markets (e.g., same customers). In this case, the sales \nforce is knowledgeable about related product character-\nistics, customers, and distribution channels.39 Interest-\ningly, Dyson, which is best known for vacuum cleaners, \nalso sells high-end hair care devices. In fact, the company has developed a new hair care device, the \nDyson Airwrap Multi-styler Complete, that dries, styles, and straightens hair at the same time, while \nusing less heat than competing hair care products. In spite of a high price tag ($599), the product is \nregularly sold out.40 Vacuum cleaners are often sold at the same retailers as these types of hair care \nproducts (i.e., Target, Walmart, traditional department stores), but there is also a knowledge base \nabout customers that can help in marketing the product—consumers willing to pay more for an \nupscale vacuum are probably also more willing to pay more for a state-of-the-art hair styling device.\nActivity sharing can be risky because ties among a firm’s businesses create links between out-\ncomes. For instance, if demand for one business’s product is reduced, it may not generate sufficient \nrevenues to cover the fixed costs required to operate the shared facilities. Also, if related busi-\nnesses are tightly linked because they share a common market or market, and there is a downturn \nin that market, then the entire organization will suffer. These types of organizational difficulties \ncan reduce activity-sharing success. Additionally, activity sharing requires careful coordination \nbetween the businesses involved (see Chapter 11 for further discussion).41\nAlthough activity sharing across businesses is not risk-free, research shows that it can create \nvalue. For example, studies of acquisitions of firms in the same industry (horizontal acquisitions) \nfound that sharing resources and activities and thereby creating economies of scope contributed to \npost-acquisition increases in performance.42 Still other research discovered that firms with closely \nrelated businesses have lower risk.43 These results suggest that gaining economies of scope by shar-\ning activities across a firm’s businesses may be important in reducing risk and in creating value \nthrough implementation of a corporate-level strategy. More attractive results are obtained through \nactivity sharing when a strong corporate headquarters office facilitates it.44\n6-4b Corporate Relatedness: Transferring of Core Competencies\nOver time, the firm’s intangible resources, such as its know-how, become the foundation of core \ncompetencies. Corporate-level core competencies are complex sets of resources and capabili-\nties that link different businesses, primarily through managerial and technological knowledge, \nexperience, and expertise.45 Intangible resources are more flexible than tangible physical assets in \nfacilitating diversification. This approach to diversification is not unfamiliar to professional service \nfirms such as Bain Strategy Consulting, which also started Bain Capital, a private equity fund, \nthrough the support of Bain partners (owners) in their consulting business.46\nIn at least two ways, the related linked diversification strategy helps firms to create value. First, \nbecause the expense of developing a core competence has already been incurred in one of the firm’s \nbusinesses, transferring this competence to a second business eliminates the need for that business \nto allocate resources to develop it. This transfer is a form of synergy, where cost savings occur \nbecause two related businesses are a part of the same firm. For example, research indicates that cen-\ntralizing research and development activities at the corporate level can lead to more collaboration \namong inventors in the corporation and to innovations that use a wider range of technologies.47 \nDyson is more than just a vacuum company.\nCorporate-level core \ncompetencies are complex \nsets of resources and \ncapabilities that link different \nbusinesses, primarily through \nmanagerial and technological \nknowledge, experience, and \nexpertise.\nDerick P.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.\n\nChapter 6: Corporate-Level Strategy\n147\nResource intangibility is a second source of value creation through corporate relatedness. \nRemember that, according to the resource-based view (see Chapters 1 and 3), because intangible \nresources are difficult for competitors to imitate, they can be effective sources of sustainable com-\npetitive advantage, leading to above-average returns.48 Consequently, the unit receiving a trans-\nferred corporate-level competence can gain an immediate competitive advantage over its rivals.49 \nA number of firms have successfully transferred one or more corporate-level core competen-\ncies across their businesses. Virgin Group Ltd. transfers its marketing core competence and asso-\nciated brand name across more than 40 companies in five business sectors across five continents. \nBusinesses Virgin owns outright or has investments in include airlines, music, health clubs, hotels, \nentertainment, mobile phones, space travel, and a number of other businesses.50 Honda has devel-\noped and transferred its competence in engine design and manufacturing among its businesses \nmaking products such as motorcycles, lawnmowers, aircraft, and cars and trucks. Honda is now \nmaking the transition to electric engines, with the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050.51\nOne way that managers facilitate the transfer of corporate-level core competencies is by moving \nkey people into new management positions.52 However, the manager of an older business may be \nreluctant to transfer key people who have accumulated knowledge and experience critical to the \nbusiness’s success. Thus, managers with the ability to facilitate the transfer of a core competence \nmay come at a premium, or the key people involved may not want to transfer. In addition, the top-\nlevel managers from the transferring business may be resistant to transfer a competency to a new \nbusiness.53 Research suggests that an effective top management team can facilitate the knowledge \nand skill transfer process.54 \n6-4c \nMarket Power\nFirms using a related diversification strategy may gain market power when successfully using a \nrelated constrained or related linked strategy. Market power exists when a firm is able to sell its prod-\nucts above the existing competitive price level, reduce the costs of its primary and support activities \nbelow the cost levels of competitors, or both.55 Heinz was bought by a private equity firm in Brazil \ncalled 3G Capital Partners LP, which subsequently combined Kraft Foods Group with Heinz to form \nKraft-Heinz in 2015. These deals were supported by Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway & Co., who \nteamed up with 3G to buy these food businesses. In a similar deal to build market power, 3G took \nprivate food restaurant Burger King Worldwide, Inc., and also bought Tim Hortons Inc. (a Canadian \ncoffee and donut fast-food restaurant) for $12.5B in 2014 through its Burger King holdings. Warren \nBuffet also contributed $11 million to help finance the latter deal. These deals build market power for \nthe combining firms in branded consumer foods and fast-food restaurants.56 These companies can \nreduce costs through larger-scale operations and combined marketing.\nIn addition to efforts to gain scale as a means of increasing market power, firms can foster \nincreased market power through multipoint competition. As described in Chapter 5, multipoint \ncompetition exists when two or more diversified firms simultaneously compete in the same prod-\nuct areas or geographical markets.57 Through multipoint competition, rival firms often experience \npressure to diversify because other firms in their dominant industry segment have made acquisi-\ntions to compete in a different market segment. The actions taken by UPS and FedEx in two mar-\nkets, overnight delivery and ground shipping, illustrate multipoint competition. UPS moved into \novernight delivery, FedEx’s stronghold; in turn, FedEx bought trucking and ground shipping assets \nto move into ground shipping, UPS’s stronghold. \nSimilarly, J.M. Smucker Company, a snack food producer, in 2015 bought Big Heart Pet \nBrands, which specializes in snacks such as Milk-Bone dog biscuits, treats, and chews and has \nover $2.2 billion in annual revenue. Smucker’s competitor, Mars, had acquired a significant por-\ntion of Proctor & Gamble’s dog and cat food division in 2014. Apparently, Smucker’s was seeking \nto keep up its size and cross-industry positions relative to Mars by also diversifying into snacks \nfor pets. In 2018, following these acquisitions, General Mills acquired Blue Buffalo Pet Products \nfor $8 billion to obtain “a piece of the rapidly expanding natural pet-food market.”58\n6-4d Vertical Integration\nSome firms using a related diversification strategy engage in vertical integration to gain market \npower. Vertical integration exists when a company produces its own inputs (backward integration) \nor owns its own source of output distribution (forward integration). For example, Apple now designs \nalmost all of the computer chips used in its products, which has given Apple “more control and better \nMarket power exists \nwhen a firm is able to sell its \nproducts above the existing \ncompetitive price level or to \nreduce the costs of its primary \nand support activities below \nthe cost levels of competitors, \nor both.\nVertical integration exists \nwhen a company produces \nits own inputs (backward \nintegration) or owns its own \nsource of output distribution \n(forward integration).\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Establishing a market price would result in high \nsearch and transaction costs, so firms seek to vertically \nintegrate rather than remain separate businesses.63\nVertical integration has its limitations. For example, an \noutside supplier may produce a raw material or supply at a \nlower cost, but the vertically integrated firm is obligated to using what is available inside the firm. \nAs a result, internal transactions from vertical integration may be expensive and reduce profitabil-\nity.64 Also, bureaucratic costs can be present with vertical integration.65 Because vertical integration \ncan require substantial investments in specific technologies, it may reduce the firm’s flexibility, \nespecially when technology changes quickly.66 Finally, changes in demand create capacity balance \nand coordination problems. If one business is building a part for another internal business but \nachieving economies of scale requires the first division to manufacture quantities that are beyond \nthe capacity of the internal buyer to absorb, it would be necessary to sell the parts outside the firm \nas well as to the internal business. Thus, although vertical integration can create value, especially \nthrough market power over competitors, it is not without risks and costs.67\n6-4e Simultaneous Operational Relatedness  \nand Corporate Relatedness\nAs Figure 6.2 suggests, some firms simultaneously seek operational and corporate relatedness to \ncreate economies of scope. The ability to simultaneously create economies of scope by sharing \nactivities (operational relatedness) and transferring core competencies (corporate relatedness) is \ndifficult for competitors to understand and learn how to imitate. However, if the costs of man-\nagement associated with realizing both types of relatedness are not offset by the benefits created, \npursuing this type of strategy leads to lower performance.68\nAmazon uses a related diversification strategy to simultaneously create economies of scope \nthrough operational and corporate relatedness. This relatedness is illustrated in how its deep cus-\ntomer knowledge is integrated in the various retail and media businesses along with the cloud ser-\nvice and shipping businesses. Amazon has pursued a related business strategy primarily through its \nonline retail portal. For example, Amazon is deriving value through its economies of scale in cloud \ncomputing and warehouse and delivery logistics expertise. Through its purchase of Whole Foods \nMarket, it now has other brick-and-morter locations to pursue its online expertise in the grocery \nbusiness.69 \nDisney also applies this strategy. The company has separate but related businesses in media net-\nworks, parks and resorts, studio entertainment, consumer products, and interactive media. Within \nthe firm’s studio entertainment business, for example, Disney can gain economies of scope by shar-\ning activities among its different movie distribution companies, such as Marvel, Touchstone Pic-\ntures, Hollywood Pictures, and Dimension Films. Disney relies on broad and deep knowledge about \nits customers to sustain its corporate-level core competencies in advertising and marketing. With \nthese competencies, Disney is able to create economies of scope through corporate relatedness as it \ncross-sells products highlighted in its movies through the distribution channels that are part of its \nparks and resorts and consumer products businesses. Thus, characters created in movies become \nWhen firms pursue vertical integration, more information is pro-\ncessed at headquarters, and thus, more knowledge processing is \nneeded, as illustrated by these servers. External relations with sup-\npliers are also supported by such information networks.\nOleksiy Mark/Shutterstock.com\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

One of these \ncommunities, called Cotino, will be located in Rancho \nMirage, California. It will feature a 24-acre lagoon, rec-\nreational water activities, and Disney programming \nthroughout the year. Cotino will also have a beachfront \nhotel, shopping, and dining.70\nAlthough The Walt Disney Company has been able \nto successfully use related diversification as a corporate \n-level strategy through which it creates economies of \nscope by sharing some activities and transferring core \ncompetencies, it may be difficult for investors to iden-\ntify the value created by a firm as it shares activities and transfers core competencies. For this \nreason, the value of the assets of a firm using a diversification strategy to create economies of scope \nis often discounted by investors.71 One notable exception to this idea is Fanatics, featured in the \nStrategic Focus. Fanatics has been able to attract major investors as it has continued to expand into \nrelated businesses.\n6-5 Value Creation through Unrelated \nDiversification\nFirms do not seek either operational relatedness or corporate relatedness when using the unre-\nlated diversification corporate-level strategy. For instance, Tata Group, featured at the beginning \nof this chapter, operates like a holding company for a wide variety of unrelated businesses (i.e., \nautomobiles, airlines, consulting, chemicals, hotels, communications).72 An unrelated diversifica-\ntion strategy (see Figure 6.2) can create value through two types of financial economies. Financial \neconomies are cost savings realized through improved allocations of financial resources based on \ninvestments inside or outside the firm.73\nResearch has shown that efficient internal capital allocations can lead to financial economies.74 \nEfficient internal capital allocations can reduce risk among the firm’s businesses, for example, by \nleading to the development of a portfolio of businesses with different risk profiles. This may be one \nreason that firms facing a higher level of competitive intensity are more prone to engage in unre-\nlated diversification than firms facing less competition.75 The second type of financial economy \nconcerns the restructuring of acquired assets. Here, the diversified firm buys another company, \nrestructures that company’s assets in ways that allow it to operate more profitably, and then sells \nthe company for a profit in the external market.76 Next, we discuss these two types of financial \neconomies in greater detail.\n6-5a Efficient Internal Capital Market Allocation\nIn a market economy, capital markets are believed to efficiently allocate capital. Efficiency results \nas investors take equity positions (ownership) with high expected future cash-flow values. Capital \nis also allocated through debt as shareholders and debt holders try to improve the value of their \ninvestments by taking stakes in businesses with high growth and profitability prospects.\nIn large, diversified firms, the corporate headquarters office distributes capital to its businesses \ninstead of external markets. Managers in a firm’s corporate headquarters generally have access to \nmore detailed and more accurate information regarding the actual and potential future perfor-\nmance of each of the businesses in the company’s portfolio than investors in the capital markets (i.e., \nstock market). Compared with corporate office personnel, external investors have relatively limited \nLearning Objective\n6-5 Explain the two ways \nvalue can be created \nwith an unrelated \ndiversification strategy.\ncanbedone/Shutterstock.com\nDisney sells many products related to its movies in its own stores as well \nas broadly through other retail outlets. \nFinancial economies are \ncost savings realized through \nimproved allocations of \nfinancial resources based on \ninvestments inside or outside \nthe firm.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Beyond U.S. borders, the company also has partners \nacross Europe, in Canada, and in Asia. The company defines itself as \n“the ultimate one-stop sports fan destination that ignites and har-\nnesses the passion of fans and maximizes the presence and reach \nfor more than 900 sports properties globally. Leveraging these \nlong-standing relationships, a database of more than 80 million \nglobal consumers and a trusted, recognizable brand name, Fanatics \nis furthering its innovation across the sports landscape and creating \na next-gen digital sports platform, complete with offerings includ-\ning merchandise, NFTs, sports betting and gaming, trading cards and \nmuch more. Fanatics is a company that the sports world has never \nseen before—and we’re just getting started.”\n“We’re just getting started” seems pretty accurate. In August 2021, \nthe company announced exclusive trading-card deals with unions that \nrepresent the players in the major U.S. leagues in baseball, football, \nand basketball, as well as the major baseball and basketball leagues \nthemselves. This was a serious blow to Topps. Co., who had a long-\nstanding relationship with these leagues. This didn’t matter for long, \nthough, because in January 2022, Fanatics reported that they were \nbuying Topps for $500 million. Previously, the company bought a  \n75 percent stake in Mitchell & Ness, a sports apparel company that \nmakes “street fashion” (throwback) apparel. Fanatics also launched a \nbusiness that sells nonfungible tokens called Candy Digital. This part \nof the business likewise has deals with the professional sports leagues. \nCandy Digital was valued at $1.5 billion in October 2021. In addition, the \ncompany owns half of Lids Sports Group, which was acquired in 2019.\nNotice that all of these businesses are closely related to each \nother. Fanatics can apply its core competency in selling sports mer-\nchandise to its new trading cards business. Existing relationships with \nthe sports leagues and player unions are helpful across all Fanatics’ \nbusinesses. The new apparel company fits nicely into the compa-\nny’s existing operations, but the company’s emphasis on throwback \napparel gives Fanatics entry into a new niche of the sports apparel \nmarket. Nonfungible tokens are a great fit with trading cards, and it \nis likely that some of the same people will buy both, which provides \na marketing fit. \nWhat’s next? In 2021, Fanatics hired Matt King, the former CEO \nof FanDuel Group, a huge online betting platform. Fanatics wants \nhim to help the company expand into the legal sports-betting indus-\ntry. Because so much of online betting deals with sports contests, \nFanatics can also use its considerable expertise with the sports indus-\ntry to help launch this business. However, online betting is not as \nclosely related as are most of the company’s businesses, so it was a \ngood move to bring in a seasoned executive with expertise in this \nindustry.\nIn 2022, Fanatics raised $1.5 billion from investors, including Fidelity \nManagement & Research Co., funds under the control of BlackRock \nInc, and MSD Capital, controlled by Michael Dell’s family. The money \nwill be used by Fanatics to continue its diversification beyond its core \nsports merchandising business. Management has confirmed that an \ninitial public offering (IPO) is likely in the future, but for now, the com-\npany is staying focused on building a strong portfolio of businesses.\nSources: M.

Consequently, corporate portfolio managers can make better deci-\nsions about how to allocate capital to these businesses than would external investors if the firm’s \nbusinesses were operated as separate entities with their own shareholders and bondholders. Capital \ncan be allocated according to more specific criteria than is possible with external market allo-\ncations.77 Research also suggests that during a financial downturn, diversification improves firm \nperformance because external capital markets are costly and internal resource allocation becomes \nmore important.78\nOne could argue that public companies are required to provide detailed information about \ntheir operations and strategies to regulators, banks, and insurance companies, and that much of \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Although businesses seeking capital must provide \ninformation to potential investors, firms with internal capital markets have at least two infor-\nmational advantages. First, information provided to capital markets through annual reports and \nother sources emphasizes positive prospects and outcomes. Investors and financiers have a limited \nability to understand the operational dynamics within large organizations. They are unlikely to \nreceive complete disclosure.79 Second, when an independent firm disseminates information, that \ninformation becomes simultaneously available to the firm’s current and potential competitors. \nCompetitors might attempt to duplicate a firm’s value-creating strategy with insights gained by \nstudying such information. Thus, the ability to keep more information private while efficiently \nallocating capital through an internal market helps the firm protect the competitive advantages it \ndevelops.\nIn addition to the information advantages associated with allocating capital across multiple \nbusiness units of a diversified firm, corporate managers also have an advantage in correcting sit-\nuations that are reducing the ability of a business unit to create value. That is, because the corpo-\nration owns the business, or at least a controlling interest in the business, it is relatively easy to \nreplace managers or require changes to strategy within an underperforming business unit. It is \nmuch more difficult to orchestrate such changes from outside a firm. External parties can try to \nmake changes by forcing the firm into bankruptcy or changing the top management team. Typi-\ncally, these changes take place through the firm’s board of directors, often because of an activist \ninvestor (an investor with a significant stake in the company). But this is much harder than, in the \ncase of an internal capital market, the corporate headquarters fine-tuning its corrections, such as \nchoosing to adjust business unit managerial incentives, encouraging strategic changes, or altering \nthe amount of resources allocated to one of the firm’s businesses.80 \nDespite the capital allocation advantages associated with an unrelated diversification strategy, \nthere are some challenges. One of the biggest problems occurs when the corporate office tries to \nmicromanage the business units in its portfolio.81 If a corporation has many unrelated businesses \nin its portfolio, corporate-level managers cannot be expected to understand the nuances of each \nbusiness. If the corporation tries to standardize practices or policies across multiple businesses, \nthese actions are unlikely to result in more value creation because each business is subject to its \nown environmental and competitive influences and has its own unique customers and dominant \ntechnologies. Another problem with using the unrelated diversification strategy is that competitors \ncan imitate financial economies more easily than they can replicate the value gained from the econ-\nomies of scope developed through operational relatedness and corporate relatedness. \nThese challenges are particularly relevant in developed economies. However, the advantages \nof unrelated diversification outweigh these problems in emerging economies, in which some of \nthe elements found in a developed economy are absent. These elements include effective financial \nintermediaries, sound regulations, and well-developed and enforced contract laws. In these situa-\ntions, internal capital markets associated with an unrelated diversification strategy are an effective \nsubstitute for external markets. In fact, in emerging economies such as those in Taiwan, India, and \nChile, research has shown that diversification increases the performance of firms affiliated within \nlarge, diversified business groups such as the Tata Group in India.82\n6-5b Restructuring of Assets\nFinancial economies can also be created when firms learn how to create value by buying, restruc-\nturing, and often selling the restructured companies’ assets in the external market.83 As in the real \nestate business, buying assets at low prices, restructuring them, and selling them at a price that \nexceeds their cost generates a positive return on the firm’s invested capital. This strategy has been \ntaken up by private equity firms, who successfully buy, restructure, and then sell, often within a \nfour- or five-year period.84\nUnrelated diversified companies that pursue this strategy try to create financial economies by \nacquiring and restructuring other companies’ assets. Some of these companies keep most of the \nassets they acquire indefinitely and use the restructuring gains to finance other acquisitions. For \nexample, Danaher Corp.’s success requires a focus on mature manufacturing businesses because of \nthe uncertainty of demand for high-technology products. It has acquired hundreds of businesses \nsince 1984 and applied the Danaher Business System to reduce costs and create a lean organization \nby finding firms that provide opportunities for consolidation during restructuring.85 Danaher has \nfocused on high-technology businesses because resource allocation decisions are highly complex \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

High-technology and service busi-\nnesses are often human-resource dependent; these people can leave or demand higher pay and thus \nappropriate or deplete the value of an acquired firm.86\nBuying and then restructuring service-based assets so they can be profitably sold in the exter-\nnal market is also difficult. Thus, for both high-technology firms and service-based companies, \nrelatively few tangible assets can be restructured to create value and sell profitably. It is difficult to \nrestructure intangible assets such as human capital and effective relationships that have evolved \nover time between buyers (customers) and sellers (firm personnel). \nSometimes unrelated diversified firms make large investments in companies so that they can \ninfluence their management, but they don’t engage in any direct restructuring activities. Ideally, \nexecutives will follow a strategy of buying businesses when prices are lower, such as in the midst \nof a recession, and selling them at late stages during an expansion. Although Berkshire Hathaway \nowns several companies outright, it also owns large stakes in many others; the company used this \napproach with its investment in Wells Fargo. Berkshire increased its investment in Wells Fargo \nduring a downturn and sold its position once the stock price improved significantly. However, this \ntactic also demonstrates the riskiness of such an approach. Although Berkshire likely made money \non the sale of stock in 2020, Wells Fargo has since experienced very high performance, and its stock \nhas soared. One analyst estimates that Berkshire “left about $15 billion on the table.”87 This is not a \nhuge number when you consider that its CEO Warren Buffet has an outstanding record of success \nand Berkshire had a market capitalization of over $670 billion as of the end of 2022. Nonetheless, \nthis example illustrates how hard it is to make money with this sort of strategy.\n6-6 Incentives Driving Value-Neutral \nDiversification\nThe objectives firms seek when using related diversification and unrelated diversification strategies \nall have the potential to help the firm create value through the corporate-level strategy. However, \nthese strategies, as well as single- and dominant-business diversification strategies, are sometimes \nused with value-neutral objectives. Basically, the quality and quantity of the firm’s resources may \npermit only diversification that is value neutral rather than value creating. Incentives to diversify \ncome from both the external environment and a firm’s internal environment. External incentives \ninclude antitrust regulations and tax laws. Internal incentives include low performance, uncertain \nfuture cash flows, and reduction of risk for the firm.\n6-6a Antitrust Regulation\nGovernment antitrust policies and tax laws provided incentives for U.S. firms to diversify in the \n1960s and 1970s.88 Antitrust laws prohibiting mergers that created increased market power were \nstringently enforced during that period. Merger activity that produced conglomerate diversifi-\ncation was encouraged primarily by the Celler-Kefauver Antimerger Act (1950), which discour-\naged mergers between companies in the same markets, as well as mergers associated with vertical \nintegration. As a result, many of the mergers during the 1960s and 1970s were “conglomerate,” \ninvolving companies pursuing different lines of business. Between 1973 and 1977, 79.1 percent of \nall mergers were conglomerates.89\nDuring the 1980s, antitrust enforcement lessened, resulting in more and larger mergers \nbetween firms in the same line of business, such as mergers between two oil companies.90 In \naddition, investment bankers became more open to the kinds of mergers facilitated by regulation \nchanges; as a consequence, takeovers increased to unprecedented numbers.91 The conglomerates, \nor highly diversified firms, of the 1960s and 1970s became more “focused” in the 1980s and early \n1990s as merger constraints were relaxed and restructuring became popular.92 At the beginning \nof the twenty-first century, antitrust concerns emerged again with the large volume of mergers \nand acquisitions (see Chapter 7).93 Mergers are now receiving even more scrutiny than they did \nat the start of this century.94 \nThus, regulatory changes such as the ones we have described create incentives or disincentives \nfor diversification. Interestingly, European antitrust laws have historically been stricter regarding \nLearning Objective\n6-6 Discuss the incentives \nand resources that \nencourage value-neutral \ndiversification.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

To illustrate this point, we will examine the influence of individual and corporate \ntax laws in the United States, recognizing that similar forces are likely to influence diversification \nbehavior in other parts of the world as well.\nWith regard to tax laws associated with individual taxes, we look at the decision companies \nmake between distributing excess cash as dividends or reinvesting it. Some companies (especially \nmature ones) generate more cash from their operations than they can reinvest profitably. Some \nargue that these free cash flows (liquid financial assets for which investments in current businesses \nare no longer economically viable) should be redistributed to shareholders as dividends.96 However, \nin the 1960s and 1970s, dividends were taxed more heavily than were capital gains (gains from price \nappreciation of a stock over time). As a result, before 1980, shareholders preferred that firms used \nfree cash flows to buy and build companies in high-performance industries. If the firm’s stock value \nappreciated over the long term, shareholders might receive a better return on those funds than if \nthe funds had been redistributed as dividends because returns from stock sales would be taxed \nmore lightly than would dividends.\nUnder the 1986 Tax Reform Act, however, the top individual ordinary income tax rate was \nreduced from 50 to 28 percent, and the special capital gains tax was changed to treat capital gains \nas ordinary income. These changes created an incentive for shareholders to stop encouraging firms \nto retain funds for diversification purposes. These tax law changes also influenced an increase in \ndivestitures of unrelated business units after 1984. Thus, while individual tax rates for capital gains \nand dividends created a shareholder incentive to increase diversification before 1986, they encour-\naged lower diversification after 1986, unless the diversification was funded by tax-deductible debt. \nYet, there have been changes in the maximum individual tax rates since the 1980s. The top individ-\nual tax rate has varied from 31 percent in 1992 to 39.6 percent in 2017. There have also been some \nchanges in the capital gains tax rates.\nCorporate tax laws also affect diversification. Acquisitions typically increase a firm’s depre-\nciable asset allowances. As a result, increased depreciation (a non-cash-flow expense) produces \nlower taxable income, thereby providing an additional incentive for acquisitions. At one time, \nacquisitions were an attractive means for securing tax benefits, but changes recommended \nby the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) eliminated the “pooling of interests” \nmethod to account for the acquired firm’s assets. It also eliminated the write-off for research \nand development in process, and thus reduced some of the incentives to make acquisitions, \nespecially acquisitions in related high-technology industries (these changes are discussed fur-\nther in Chapter 7).97\n6-6c \nLow Performance\nSome research shows that low returns are related to greater levels of diversification.98 If high per-\nformance eliminates the need for greater diversification, then low performance may provide an \nincentive for diversification. GlaxoSmithKline PLC suffered from volatile earnings growth and \npoor stock price performance through the second decade of this century. The company’s stock \nprice was right around $50 at the end of 2014 and was hovering around $40 three years later, in \n2017.99 That is when newly appointed CEO Emma Walmsley embarked on a plan to turn around \nthe company. As a part of that plan, Glaxo diversified into cancer drugs through the acquisition of \noncology specialist Tesaro for $4.16 billion. Unfortunately, this acquisition did little to fix Glaxo’s \nproblems. In 2021, an activist investor described Glaxo as being too bureaucratic, and “failing \nto empower its scientists, spending less on research and development than its competitors, and \nhaving maintained a dividend that it couldn’t afford.”100\nAlthough firms such as GlaxoSmithKline may have an incentive to diversify, there is a need \nto be careful because there are risks to moving into new areas where the company lacks exper-\ntise. There can be negative synergy (where potential synergy between acquiring and target firms \nis illusory), problems between leaders, and cultural fit difficulties that make value creation \ndifficult.101 \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

For several years, Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, pursued \na “multi-material” diversification strategy driven by the highly competitive nature of its basic \ncommodity business. Alcoa diversified into other metals besides aluminum while simultaneously \nmoving into a variety of end-product industries. However, the company may have gone too far \nwith its diversification strategy; in 2016, under pressure from an activist investor, it split into two \nseparate companies: Alcoa Corporation (mining and manufacture of raw aluminum) and Arconic \n(processor of aluminum and other metals).103\nThe risk associated with uncertain cash flows is related to the risk that the firm might fail. \nEarlier in this chapter, we explained that closely related businesses might rely on the same mar-\nkets, and if a common market experiences a downturn, it could hurt the performance of all the \nrelated businesses that depend on it. Also, similarly, diversified firms pursuing economies of scope \noften have investments that are too inflexible as they try to realize synergy among business units. \nFor example, a factory might be designed to serve two or more related business units, but that \nalso means that it would be difficult to repurpose it if one of the related business units no longer \nneeds it. As mentioned previously, synergy exists when the value created by business units working \ntogether exceeds the value that those same units create working independently.104 However, as a \nfirm increases its relatedness among business units in pursuit of synergy, it also increases its risk \nof corporate failure because synergy produces joint interdependence among businesses that con-\nstrains the firm’s flexibility to respond.105 \nA firm that is overexposed to risk of failure because of interdependencies among its related \nbusinesses or uncertain cash flows may decide to begin operating in different environments that \nare more certain. Expanding into environments that are more certain likely leads to diversification \ninto industries with low growth potential.106 Alternatively, the firm may constrain its level of activ-\nity sharing and forgo the potential benefits of synergy.\nNeither diversifying to address uncertain cash flows or expanding into different environ-\nments is likely to create more value, which is why they are a part of this section on value-neutral \ndiversification. Similarly, diversifying in response to antitrust legislation or tax law changes, or \nbecause the firm is low performing, is not likely to increase performance. However, none of these \nreasons will necessarily reduce performance either. GlaxoSmithKline’s poor performance is not \na result of its diversification into cancer drugs, but the acquisition of Tesaro did not solve its \nperformance problems either. On the other hand, there are reasons for diversification that tend \nto reduce the value a firm produces for its stakeholders. These reasons will be explained in the \nnext section.\n6-7 Managerial Motives to Diversify\nResearch evidence and the experience of many firms suggest that an overall curvilinear relation-\nship, as illustrated in Figure 6.3, may exist between diversification and performance.107 Firms that \nare more broadly diversified compared to their competitors may have overall lower performance. \nOne example of this phenomenon is the breakup of GE, discussed previously in this chapter. Prior \nto the breakup, GE was underperforming—the business units it was managing were losing their \ncompetitiveness. One of these underperforming business units, the appliance business, was sold \nto Qingdao, China–based Haier Group, in 2016. No longer under the management of GE, the \nappliance business is thriving, gaining market share in the United States every year from 2017 to \n2021.108 One reason for the lower performance of highly diversified firms may be that higher levels \nof diversification are often found to be associated with lower levels of innovation.109 This notion \nholds true in the case of GE’s cast-off appliance business, Haier Group, which focuses on home \nappliances and consumer electronics, has invested $1.5 billion in technology and new products in \nits appliance business.110\nIf higher levels of diversification often lead to lower performance, at least for firms in highly \ndeveloped economies, why would top-level executives pursue such a strategy? Managerial motives \nto diversify can exist independent of value-neutral or value-creating reasons. The desire for reduced \nLearning Objective\n6-7 Describe motives \nthat can encourage \nmanagers to diversify a \nfirm too much.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

For example, decisions to expand a firm’s portfolio of businesses to reduce managerial \nrisk can negatively affect the firm’s value. The type of managerial risk we are discussing refers to \nemployment risk—the risk of job loss.112 Greater amounts of diversification reduce managerial risk \nbecause if one of the businesses in a diversified firm performs poorly or fails, the top executive has \na lower risk of job loss because some other business is (hopefully) doing well. Top-level executives \nmay diversify a firm in order to spread their own employment risk, as long as profitability does not \nsuffer excessively.113 If profits take a big drop as a result of the additional diversification, they will \nstill be at risk of being replaced by the board of directors. This sort of unprofitable diversification \nis often called empire building.\nIn addition, because diversification can increase a firm’s size and thus managerial compensation, \nmanagers may have motives to diversify a firm to a level that reduces its value.114 Research evidence \nshows that diversification and firm size are highly correlated, and as firm size increases, so does \nexecutive compensation and social status.115 Because large firms are complex, difficult-to-manage \norganizations, top-level managers commonly receive substantial levels of compensation.116 Greater \nlevels of diversification can increase this complexity, resulting in still more compensation for exec-\nutives as they lead an increasingly diversified organization. Governance mechanisms—such as \nthe board of directors, monitoring by owners, executive compensation practices, and the threat of \nbeing taken over through an acquisition—can reduce tendencies to diversify beyond the point at \nwhich no new value is created.117 These mechanisms are discussed in more detail in Chapter 10.\nIn some instances, though, a firm’s governance mechanisms may not be strong, allowing exec-\nutives to diversify the firm to the point that it fails to earn even average returns.118 The loss of \nadequate internal governance may result in relatively poor performance, thereby triggering a threat \nof takeover. This result is referred to as a capital market intervention because it involves external \ncapital market participants—investors who are attempting to gain high returns from their capital \ninvestments. \nAlthough takeovers may improve firm performance by replacing ineffective managerial \nteams, managers may avoid takeovers through defensive tactics, such as “poison pills” that make \nthe firm less attractive.119 One example is a “golden parachute” agreement that gives top execu-\ntives (especially the CEO) a huge payment if the firm is acquired and they no longer work for \nit.120 For example, in the case of a takeover bid by Oracle of Cerner Corp., a computer and infor-\nmation technology company: “Four top executives, including former Cerner CEO Brent Shafer, \nhave golden parachutes ranging from $10 million to almost $22 million if they are forced out in \nthe Oracle acquisition, according to a filing with the SEC.” Therefore, an external governance \nFigure 6.3 The Curvilinear Relationship between Diversification and Performance\nPerformance\nLevel of Diversiﬁcation\nDominant\nBusiness\nRelated\nConstrained\nUnrelated\nBusiness\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Thus, it is overly pessimistic to assume that managers usually \nact in their own self-interest as opposed to their firm’s interest.123\nTop-level executives’ diversification decisions may also be held in check by concerns for their \nreputation. If a positive reputation facilitates development and use of managerial power, a poor rep-\nutation can reduce it. Likewise, a strong external market for managerial talent may deter managers \nfrom pursuing inappropriate diversification.124 In addition, a diversified firm may acquire other \nfirms that are poorly managed in order to restructure its own asset base. Knowing that their firms \ncould be acquired if they are not managed successfully encourages executives to use value-creating \ndiversification strategies.\nFigure 6.4 provides a model that combines many of the essential ideas found in this chap-\nter. Diversification with the greatest potential for a positive effect on performance is a result of \nvalue-creating influences (economies of scope, market power, financial economies), promoted by \neffective internal governance (see Chapter 10 for a more detailed discussion). Value-neutral incen-\ntives, low performance, and the desire to reduce uncertainty of cash flows and risk of firm fail-\nure may promote diversification but are not expected to add much, if any, value for stakeholders. \nManagerial motives to diversify can also reduce value, but hopefully, internal governance and the \nthreat of takeover will keep these motives in check. How a corporate-level diversification strategy is \nimplemented also influences the amount of value created for stakeholders (i.e., firm performance).\nFigure 6.4 Summary Model of the Relationship between Diversification and Firm Performance\nFirm\nPerformance\nValue-Neutral\nInfluences\n•  Incentives\n•  Low Performance\n•  Risk of Failure\nValue-Creating\nInfluences\n•  Economies of Scope\n•  Market Power\n•  Financial Economics\nValue-Reducing\nInfluences\n•  Managerial Motives\n   to Diversify\nInternal\nGovernance\nStrategy\nImplementation\nDiversification\nStrategy\nCapital Market\nIntervention and the\nMarket for\nManagerial Talent\nSource: Adapted from R.

In the next chapter, we discuss \nmergers and acquisitions as prominent means for firms to diversify and grow. These trend toward \nmore diversification through acquisitions, which have been partially reversed due to restructuring \n(see Chapter 7), are an indication that learning has taken place regarding corporate-level diversi-\nfication strategies.125 Accordingly, firms that diversify should do so cautiously, choosing to focus \non relatively few, rather than many, businesses. In fact, research suggests that although unrelated \ndiversification has decreased, related diversification has increased, possibly due to the restructur-\ning that continued from the 1990s through the early twenty-first century. This sequence of diversi-\nfication followed by restructuring has occurred in Europe and in countries such as Korea, following \nactions of firms in the United States and the United Kingdom.126 Firms can improve their strategic \ncompetitiveness when they pursue a level and type of diversification that is appropriate for their \nresources and core competencies and the opportunities and threats in their country’s institutional \nand competitive environments.127\nSummary\n \n● Firms use a corporate-level strategy to become \nmore diversified in an effort to create more value for \nstakeholders. Using a single- or dominant-business \ncorporate-level strategy may be preferable to seeking \na more diversified strategy, unless a corporation can \ndevelop economies of scope or financial economies \nbetween businesses, or unless it can obtain market \npower through additional levels of diversification. \nEconomies of scope and market power are the \nmain sources of value creation when the firm uses a \ncorporate-level strategy to achieve moderate to high \nlevels of diversification.\n \n● The related diversification corporate-level strategy \nhelps the firm create value by sharing activities or \ntransferring competencies between different busi-\nnesses in the company’s portfolio.\n \n● Operational relatedness is associated with sharing tan-\ngible resources between businesses. Sharing activities \nare usually associated with the related constrained \ndiversification strategy. Activity sharing is costly to \nimplement and coordinate, may create unequal ben-\nefits for the divisions involved in the sharing, and can \nlead to fewer managerial risk-taking behaviors.\n \n● Corporate relatedness is associated with transferring \ncore competencies across business units or from the \ncorporate headquarters office to a business unit. \nTransferring core competencies is often associated \nwith related linked (or mixed related and unrelated) \ndiversification, although firms pursuing both sharing \nactivities and transferring core competencies can also \nuse the related linked strategy.\n \n● Efficiently allocating resources or restructuring a target \nfirm’s assets and placing them under rigorous financial \ncontrols are two ways to accomplish successful unre-\nlated diversification. Firms using the unrelated diversi-\nfication strategy focus on creating financial economies \nto generate value.\n \n● Diversification is sometimes pursued for value-neutral \nreasons. Incentives from tax and antitrust government \npolicies, low performance, or uncertainties about \nfuture cash flow are examples of value-neutral reasons \nthat firms choose to become more diversified.\n \n● Managerial motives to diversify (including to increase \ncompensation or reduce risk of job loss) can lead to \nan unprofitably high level of diversification and a sub-\nsequent reduction in a firm’s ability to create value for \nstakeholders. Evidence suggests, however, that many \ntop-level executives seek to be good stewards of the \nfirm’s assets and avoid diversifying the firm in ways \nthat destroy value.\n \n● Managers need to consider their firm’s internal orga-\nnization and its external environment when making \ndecisions about the optimum level of diversification for \ntheir company. Of course, internal resources are import-\nant determinants of the direction that diversification \nshould take. However, conditions in the firm’s external \nenvironment or unexpected threats from competitors \nmay facilitate additional levels of diversification.\nKey Terms\ncorporate-level core competencies 146\ncorporate-level strategy 140\ncorporate relatedness 145\neconomies of scope 143\nfinancial economies 149\nmarket power 147\noperational relatedness 145\nsynergy 143\nvertical integration 147\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

What is corporate-level strategy, and why is it important?\n2. What are the different levels of diversification firms can \npursue by using different corporate-level strategies?\n3. What are three reasons firms choose to diversify their \noperations?\n4. How do firms create value when using a related diver-\nsification strategy?\n5. What are the two ways to obtain financial econo-\nmies when using an unrelated diversification strat-\negy?\n6. What incentives and resources encourage diversifica-\ntion?\n7. What motives might encourage managers to diversify \ntheir firms too much?\nMini-Case\nBlackRock Inc. Corporate Strategy\nBlackRock Inc. is the world’s largest asset manager, with \nassets under management of $10 trillion at the end of 2021. \nAlthough most of its revenue comes from investment advi-\nsory and administrative fees, BlackRock also has businesses \nthat provide technology systems, risk management services, \nand digital distribution tools to a variety of clients such as \ninsurance companies, banks, and pension fund managers. \nIn addition, the company provides consulting services to \nregulators, banks, and governments. These other businesses \naccount for about 14 percent of BlackRock’s revenues.\nOne noteworthy feature that sets BlackRock apart from \nother asset managers is its focus on sustainability, “As the \nworld transitions to a low-carbon economy, our clients want \nto understand how to address climate risks in their portfolios. \nThat’s why we provide more sustainable investment options \nthan anyone and make sustainability the standard for how we \nmanage our clients’ money.” \nBlackRock not only invests client money in sustainable \ncompanies but also actively engages in championing sustain-\nability causes. For example, one of the biggest deterrents to \neffective socially responsible investing is that firms do not \nreport on ESG (environment, society, governance) consis-\ntently. “Investment professionals in alternative asset classes \nhave a growing need to access ESG data to help identify risk \nand opportunities. However, private market participants \nlooking to incorporate ESG factors face complex decisions on \nwhich metrics are considered relevant due to the large array of \nframeworks in circulation and the evolving regulatory land-\nscape.” To address this problem, BlackRock announced in \n2022 that it was working in a consortium of Limited Partners \nand Funds of Funds to help “streamline and standardize ESG \nreporting for private markets.” \nThere has been some pushback with regard to the way \nBlackRock and other socially responsible fund managers \ndo business. “BlackRock continues to receive criticism for \nits stance around climate-friendly policies. Last June [2021], \nTexas passed a bill requiring state entities like pensions to \nstop doing business with companies that boycott the fos-\nsil-fuel industry…. Lawmakers suggested that BlackRock is \na likely candidate for the list—putting it at risk of losing mil-\nlions of dollars of Texas pension business.”\nAnother issue stems from the fact that big investment \nmanagement companies typically vote their client’s shares, \nwhich gives them tremendous influence over public compa-\nnies. CEO Larry Fink insists that BlackRock’s consideration \nof environmental, social, and governance risks is about long-\nterm returns and not politics. He said climate change “has \nbecome a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects.” \nThere is pending legislation that would give passive inves-\ntors the opportunity to vote when asset managers own more \nthan 1 percent of a company’s voting securities. BlackRock \nis already expanding proxy voting for its clients, and some \ninstitutional investors can now vote their shares.\nBlackRock also makes investments in nontraditional assets \nwhen they have the potential to help clients meet their finan-\ncial goals. For example, BlackRock and Warner Music invested \n$750 million in a fund with the objective of purchasing music-\nrights catalogs from diverse and female artists. “Unlike many \nrecent blockbuster deals for decades-old music that can pro-\nvide stable returns for passive investors collecting royalty pay-\nments, the new fund is focused on so-called modern evergreen \nmusic. It is investing in artists who are still writing music and \nlooking to actively work—and maintain a stake in—their cata-\nlogs alongside their investors.” The fund has already purchased \n20 catalogs. Lylette Pizarro, founder and co-managing partner \nof Influence Media, is very optimistic about emerging and ris-\ning artists, stating that “data are showing the work of certain \nyounger artists is resisting the decay in listenership that has \nbeen typical for music less than 10 years old.”\nSources: A.

The value of deals in the industry involving U.S.-based financial services \ncompanies rose from $558 billion in 2020 to $1.15 trillion in 2021. This volume of \n8,307 deals indicates that a major consolidation trend has been occurring in the \nfinancial services industry for some time now. Industry consolidation means that \nfirms in the same industry merge, reducing the number of industry competitors. All \nthe airline mergers in the past decade indicate a consolidation in that industry also.\nSeveral different reasons explain why firms in the same industry consolidate, but \nthey all tend to reflect a desire to gain market power (see Chapter 6). Among the \ndeals in 2021, Block (formerly called Square), a company involved in digital payments, \nagreed to pay $29 billion for Afterpay, an Australian company that engages in the \nbuy-now-pay-later payments business. Afterpay pioneered the buy-now-pay-later \nbusiness in Australia and then expanded into Europe and the United States. This \nclosely related acquisition offers opportunities for synergy because both companies \nare heavily involved in digital technologies associated with payments processing. \n“Square aims to integrate Afterpay into its Cash and Seller apps, linking service for \nconsumers and merchants.”\nIn banking, M&T Bank, based in Buffalo, New York, announced an agreement to \nbuy People’s United Financial in Connecticut. The $7.6 billion deal created “the largest \ncommunity-focused commercial bank in the northeast and mid-Atlantic.” M&T was \nalready the largest New York–based lender in its region and is one of the largest \nregional banks in the northeastern United States. In this case, M&T bank gained more \nmarket power through even greater economies of scale in the region. Explaining the \ndeal, M&T Bank Chief Executive \nRène Jones said, “The radius \nfrom the center of our franchise \nto the farthest branch is just \nunder 300 miles, so we can \nactually be a really relevant \nfinancial institution to our cus-\ntomers in those regions.” The \ncombined company may also \nenjoy economies of scope as \nthe two banks share resources \n(see Chapter 6). In addition, \nM&T Bank’s core competence \nin serving local communities \ncould be transferred to People’s \nUnited.\nThere were also some large \ndeals in which financial services \nfirms sold off part of their oper-\nations to improve their focus on \nwhat they do best, while the firm buying those operations could also enhance their \nmarket power. For example, Chubb LTD paid $6 billion to buy “Cigna’s life, accident \nand supplemental health benefits in several countries.” This acquisition expanded \nChubb’s presence in Asia.\nOne of the major trends driving the consolidation is the need for digital trans-\nformation (see Chapter 2). “Banks must heavily invest in digital transformation not \nsimply to be in the game, but to be on the field at all.” Another trend is that smaller \nregional financial institutions are merging to be competitive in the industry. The M&T \nBank deal reflects this trend. In addition, many mergers are pursued to expand geo-\ngraphically or to pursue operational efficiencies. Industry experts expect the consoli-\ndation trend to continue in the financial services industry.\nSources: T. Johnson, 2022, Financial services M&A sets a new record in 2021.

As noted in that chapter, diversification allows a firm to create value by pro-\nductively using excess resources to exploit new opportunities.1 In this chapter, we explore \nmerger and acquisition strategies. Firms throughout the world use these strategies to grow \nand become more diversified.2 Some firms, such as those in the financial services industry \ndiscussed in the Opening Case, get swept up in a major industry consolidation. Many of them \ncombine with another firm that does the same thing, called a horizontal acquisition (i.e., bank \nmerging with a bank), with the intent of increasing market power or geographic reach to \nremain competitive.\nMany acquisitions fail to achieve the desired results, such as increased financial perfor-\nmance.3 A key objective of this chapter is to explain how firms can successfully use merger and \nacquisition strategies to create stakeholder value and competitive advantages.4 To reach this \nobjective, we first discuss the continuing popularity of merger and acquisition strategies. As part \nof this explanation, we describe the differences between mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers. \nWe next discuss specific reasons why firms choose to use merger and acquisition strategies and \nsome of the problems organizations may encounter when doing so. We then describe the char-\nacteristics associated with effective acquisitions (we focus on acquisition strategies in the chap-\nter) before closing the chapter with a discussion of different types of restructuring strategies. \nRestructuring strategies are commonly used to correct the results from unsuccessful mergers \nand acquisitions.\n7-1 Merger and Acquisition Strategies\nMerger and acquisition (M&A) strategies have been popular among U.S. firms for many years. \nSome believe that these strategies played a central role in the restructuring of U.S. businesses during \nthe 1980s and 1990s and that they continue generating these types of benefits in the twenty-first \ncentury. In fact, mergers and acquisitions also have a huge global impact. According to KPMG, \n“Global mergers and acquisition activity in 2021 easily surpassed the pre-pandemic level and nearly \nmatched the peaks of 2015 and 2007.”5\nAlthough popular as a way of creating value and earning above-average returns, it is chal-\nlenging to effectively implement merger and acquisition strategies. This is particularly true \nfor the acquiring firms; some research results indicate that shareholders of the acquired firms \noften earn above-average returns from acquisitions, while shareholders of the acquiring firms \ntypically earn returns that are close to zero.6 Moreover, in approximately two-thirds of all \nacquisitions, the acquiring firm’s stock price falls immediately after the intended transaction is \nannounced. This negative response reflects investors’ skepticism about the likelihood that the \nacquirer will be able to achieve the synergies required to justify the premium to purchase the \ntarget firm.7\nDiscussed more fully later in the chapter, paying excessive premiums to acquire firms can \nnegatively influence the results a firm achieves through an acquisition strategy. Determining the \nworth of a target firm is difficult; this difficulty increases the likelihood a firm will pay a premium \nto acquire a target. Premiums are paid when those leading an acquiring firm conclude that the \ntarget firm would be worth more under its ownership than it would be as part of any other own-\nership arrangement or if it were to remain as an independent company. Recently, for example, \nQuidel Corp. (a U.S.-based global diagnostic healthcare provider) agreed to pay $24.68 per share \nfor Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (a U.S.-based global provider of in vitro diagnostics), a 25 percent \npremium over Ortho’s closing price on the previous day.8 For this $6 billion to be considered a \nsuccess, the combined company must generate what amounts to $1.5 billion in synergy through \nthe combination. This goal may be possible, or it may not. That’s why a lot of acquisitions are con-\nsidered failures. Also, a 25 percent premium is not considered high. Consider how much harder it \nwill be to justify an acquisition premium of 40 percent, which is what Liaoning Fangda (a Chinese \nindustrial conglomerate) paid to acquire Hainan Airlines (also Chinese) in a $1.9 billion deal.9 \nSimilarly, Toronto-Dominion Bank (Canada) paid a 37 percent premium to acquire First Horizon \n(U.S.) in a $13.4 billion deal.10\nLearning Objective\n7-1 Differentiate \nbetween merger and \nacquisition strategies in \nfirms competing in the \nglobal economy.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

For \nexample, two oil shale drillers, Oasis Petroleum Inc. and \nWhiting Petroleum Co., merged in 2022, creating Chord \nEnergy Corporation. Mark Viviano, from private-equity firm \nKimmeridge Energy Management Co., which owns a stake in \nOasis, said about the deal, “This merger of equals amongst offsetting operators will help the com-\nbined company gain operational scale, with synergies accruing to both sets of shareholders.”11 Two \nclues about whether the deal is a merger or an acquisition are whether the combined company will \ntake on a new name and have a new ticker symbol. These are not requirements, but when they do \noccur, it is strong evidence that the deal is a merger rather than an acquisition. In the case of Oasis \nand Whiting, both conditions hold. \nEvidence suggests that finalizing a proposal for firms to merge on an equal or a relatively equal \nbasis is difficult. On a practical basis, deciding who will lead the merged firm, how to fuse what are \noften disparate corporate cultures, and how to reach an agreement about the value of each company \nprior to the merger are issues that commonly affect firms’ efforts to merge on a coequal basis. For \nthe Oasis and Whiting merger, Whiting’s current president and CEO will assume the position as \nexecutive chairman of the board of directors of the new company. Oasis CEO Danny Brown will \njoin the board and will serve as the combined company’s CEO.12\nAn acquisition is a strategy through which a firm buys most or all a company’s stock with the \nintent of making the acquired firm a subsidiary business within its portfolio.13 After the acquisition \nis completed, the management of the acquired firm reports to the management of the acquiring \nfirm.\nAlthough most mergers that are completed are friendly in nature, acquisitions can be friendly \nor unfriendly. A takeover is a special type of acquisition where the target firm does not solicit the \nacquiring firm’s bid.14 Thus, takeovers are unfriendly, sometimes called “hostile,” acquisitions. As \nexplained in Chapter 10, firms have developed defenses (mostly corporate governance devices) that \ncan be used to prevent an unrequested and undesired takeover bid from being successful.15\nWhen an unsolicited bid is received, the takeover target may try to determine the highest \namount the acquiring firm is willing to pay, even while simultaneously using defense mechanisms \nto prevent a takeover attempt from succeeding. Multiple exchanges may take place between a \npotential acquirer and its target before a resolution of the unsolicited bid is reached, and these \nexchanges can become quite complicated. The exchanges between Broadcom and Qualcomm, two \nsemiconductor producers, demonstrate this complexity. Broadcom made an offer for Qualcomm \nwhile Qualcomm’s price was depressed due to regulator challenges over Qualcomm’s dominance \nas a critical cell phone component supplier. At the same time, Qualcomm was seeking to close a \ndeal for NPX, a semiconductor producer focused on automobiles and self-driving cars, which led \nto Broadcom lowering its offer price.16 Ultimately, Broadcom withdrew its offer because it was \ndisallowed by regulators due to government intellectual property and security concerns.17 And \nQualcomm walked away from the purchase of NPX due to lack of approval by Chinese regulators.\nOn a comparative basis, acquisitions are more common than mergers and takeovers. Accord-\ningly, we focus most of the remainder of this chapter’s discussion on acquisitions.\n7-2 Reasons for Acquisitions\nIn this section, we discuss reasons why firms decide to acquire another company. As this discus-\nsion shows, there are many unique reasons that firms choose to use an acquisition strategy.18\n7-2a Increased Market Power\nAchieving greater market power is a primary reason for acquisitions.19 Defined in Chapter 6, \nmarket power exists when a firm can sell its goods or services above competitive levels or when \nthe costs of its primary or support activities are lower than those of its competitors. Market power \nLearning Objective\n7-2 Discuss reasons \nwhy firms use an \nacquisition strategy \nto achieve strategic \ncompetitiveness.\nAn acquisition is a strategy \nthrough which one firm \nbuys most or all a company’s \nshares with the intent of \nmaking the acquired firm a \nsubsidiary business within its \nportfolio.\nA takeover is a special type \nof acquisition where the \ntarget firm does not solicit the \nacquiring firm’s bid.\nA merger is a strategy \nthrough which two firms \nagree to integrate their \noperations on a relatively \ncoequal basis.\nChord Energy was established in 2022, following the merger of \nOasis Petroleum and Whiting Petroleum.\nSource: LinkedIn\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

However, the company is also engaged in other closely related \nproducts, including servers, devices (i.e., laptops, workstations), wireless \nproducts, ethernet products, solid-state drives, and artificial intelligence. \nIn fact, Intel’s website lists over 60 product categories, with multiple prod-\nucts within each category. Intel has achieved this high level of related \ndiversification primarily through 92 acquisitions, as of the end of 2021. \nIntel’s diversified portfolio has been helpful in weathering recent \nstorms. In 2018, most of the Intel processors in current use were reported \nto be subject to security flaws. Fixing the flaws led to reductions in speed. \nOf course, Intel announced later in the year that it would redesign its \ncentral processing units to protect against these flaws, but other prob-\nlems were found later in the year, as well as new flaws reported in 2019 \nand 2020. Perhaps at least in part because of these problems, in 2020, \nApple announced that it would be switching from Intel chips to its own \nin-house design for the entire Mac line. This switch was a big blow for \nIntel, but the company still had other businesses that were doing well.\nAlthough Intel’s many acquisitions have increased its market power, \nIntel’s performance relative to its competitors has been a disappoint-\nment to investors and analysts in recent years. To remedy the situation, \nPat Gelsinger was chosen as CEO in early 2021 with the intention of \norchestrating “the company’s revival plan.” True to the history of Intel as \na highly acquisitive firm, Gelsinger said, “There will be consolidation in \nthe industry. That trend will continue, and I expect that we’re going to \nbe a consolidator.” Gelsinger was involved in about 100 acquisitions in \nhis prior executive roles in EMC Corp. and VMware Inc. This experience \nmakes him an excellent choice for an acquisition-based turnaround.\nIn 2021, Intel made several acquisitions. In June, the company \nacquired SiFive, a U.S. company involved in leading-edge semicon-\nductor technology. In November, Intel acquired RemoteMyApp, a \nPolish company engaged in cloud-gaming solutions for businesses. \nIn December, the company acquired Screenovate, an Israeli company \nthat developed a technology that allows smartphone screens to be \nprojected onto computers and TVs.  \nFor more than a decade leading up to a major global chip shortage \nin 2021 and 2022, the major players in the market had been outsourcing \nproduction of their chips to specialist manufacturers. However, the short-\nage led to a rethinking of this strategy. Samsung made a bold move by \nannouncing its intention to build a $17 billion chip factory in the United \nStates, “part of the Korean company’s bid to compete in the foundry \nbusiness—making chips under contract for the companies that design \nthem.” Likewise, Intel made a major move to ramp up production of other \ncompanies’ chips. In February of 2022, the company announced it would \nacquire Tower Semiconductor, an Israeli company that manufactures \n2 million wafers a year for other chipmakers. Wafers are the building blocks \nfrom which integrated circuits (chips) are made. The $5.4 billion deal is \nthe fourth largest in Intel’s history, behind Altera, Mobileye, and McAffee.\nAlthough Intel paid a 60 percent premium over-market value to \nbuy Tower, analysts understand the logic behind the acquisition: “The \nrich price makes sense given the current realities of the chip manu-\nfacturing market and Intel’s stated ambitions. It has long manufac-\ntured processors for PCs and servers that it designs itself. But booming \ndemand for chips of all types plus a global shortage of production \ncapabilities have created an opportunity for Intel to open its fabri-\ncation facilities to designs by others. This so-called foundry business \nmodel is a key part of the company’s turnaround plan as it also seeks \nto recover its lead in the most advanced chipmaking processes now \nheld by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC.”\nIntel also sells businesses that no longer fit well within its business \nportfolio. In February 2022, Intel got approval from a Chinese regulator \nto sell its flash-memory chip business to South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. \nChina’s antitrust regulator “has broad reach to claim say over deals in \nwhich at least one party has a significant presence in the Chinese mar-\nket.” The $9 billion deal will help Intel pay for its acquisition of Tower.\nIntel announced that it would be taking its Mobileye business unit \npublic in mid-2022. Mobileye makes “chip-based camera systems that \npower automated driving features in cars.” Intel believes Mobileye \nwill achieve a market valuation of $50 billion, which is a nice return \non an investment of a little over $15 billion it paid when it acquired \nMobileye in 2017. The company will also include a recent acquisition \nof Moovit, an Israeli company that uses crowdsourced data to provide \ntransit information even when there is no officially available data. Intel \nwill retain a controlling interest in the company.\nSources: J. Yang, 2022, AMD’s planned purchase of Xilinx clears last regulatory hurdle, Wall \nStreet Journal, www.wsj.com, January 28; D.

As the Strategic Focus explains, the massive chipmaker Intel has \na long history of acquiring companies to increase its market power.\nNext, we discuss how firms use horizontal, vertical, and related types of acquisitions to increase \ntheir market power. Active acquirers simultaneously pursue two or all three types of acquisitions \nto do this. For example, Amazon has been expanding the scale and scope of its operations both \nhorizontally (new international markets, new products) and vertically (moving into shipping).21 \nThese three types of acquisitions are subject to regulatory review by various governmental entities. \nSometimes these reviews bring about the dissolution of proposed transactions, as illustrated in the \nBroadcom takeover attempt of Qualcomm discussed previously. Also, Amazon’s bid to acquire a \nlarge stake in an Indian retailer called Future Retail is being scrutinized by India’s antitrust body.22 \nFuture Retail operates more than 1,500 stores in the country. \nHorizontal Acquisitions\nThe acquisition of a company competing in the same industry as the acquiring firm is a horizontal \nacquisition. Horizontal acquisitions increase a firm’s market power by exploiting cost-based and \nrevenue-based synergies.23 Horizontal acquisitions occur frequently in the financial services \nindustry, as illustrated in the Strategic Focus. Research suggests that horizontal acquisitions result \nin higher performance when the firms have similar characteristics, such as strategy, managerial \nstyles, and resource allocation patterns.24 Similarities in these characteristics, as well as previous \nexperience in managing alliances between the two companies, support efforts to integrate the \nacquiring and the acquired firm. Horizontal acquisitions are often most effective when the acquir-\ning firm effectively integrates the acquired firm’s assets with its own, but only after evaluating \nand divesting excess capacity and assets that do not complement the newly combined firm’s core \ncompetencies.25\nBecause horizontal acquisitions involve companies that are competing in the same industry, \nthey are highly subject to antitrust enforcement. Introduced in Chapter 2, antitrust legislation is \nfound in most countries; the object is to protect consumers and other stakeholders against anti-\ncompetitive practices that occur when a company gets so large and powerful in a market that oth-\ners have a hard time competing with it. With a great deal of market power, the firm can establish \nhigher prices than it would be able to do if the market were competitive; it can then engage in \nother practices that are detrimental to consumers, competitors, suppliers, and government orga-\nnizations. In Chapter 2, we mentioned that the FTC sued to block Lockheed Martin from buying \nAerojet Rocketdyne Holdings.26 In another example, “France’s OVHcloud has filed a complaint that \nMicrosoft is abusing its position to hurt competition in the cloud-computing market.”27\nVertical Acquisitions\nA vertical acquisition refers to a firm acquiring a supplier or distributor of one or more of its \nproducts. Through a vertical acquisition, the newly formed firm controls additional parts of the \nvalue chain (see Chapter 3), which is how vertical acquisitions lead to increased market power. 28\nThrough vertical integration, a firm has an opportunity to appropriate value being generated in \na part of the value chain in which it does not currently compete, or to increase its participation in \nthat part of the value chain, and to better control its own destiny in terms of costs and access. These \nmotives led Amazon pursue an acquisition of movie studio MGM, which previously was a supplier \nof movies to Amazon. Although Amazon was already producing its own movies, MGM controls a \nhuge volume of popular titles, including the James Bond series. It was Amazon’s intention to use the \nacquisition to beef up its Prime Video streaming service to better compete with rivals like Netflix. In \napproving the deal, the European Commission’s top regulator said, “the deal wouldn’t significantly \nreduce competition in part because the companies don’t significantly overlap in movie production.” 29\nA firm can also enhance its production efficiency through vertical acquisitions, especially if \nthere is some degree of relatedness between the industries of the acquiring and target firm.30 In \naddition, research evidence suggests that firms that engage in a vertical acquisition experience an \nincrease in their levels of innovation.31 \nA vertical acquisition refers \nto a firm acquiring a supplier \nor distributor of one or more \nof its products.\nA horizontal acquisition is \nan acquisition of a company \ncompeting in the same \nindustry as the acquiring firm.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Through a related \nacquisition, firms seek to create value through the synergy that can be generated by integrating \nsome of their resources and capabilities.32\nCisco Systems, a Silicon Valley (California) company, designs, manufacturers, and sells net-\nworking equipment. Over time, the firm has engaged in related acquisitions, primarily as a foun-\ndation for being able to compete aggressively in other product markets. For example, as software \nbecomes a more integral aspect of all networking products, the firm is acquiring software compa-\nnies that support and protect cloud computing, its newest emphasis. Cisco bought cloud software \nfirm BroadSoft (U.S.) and AI monitoring manager AppDynamics (U.S.) in 2017, followed by cloud \ncommunications software firm IMImobile (U.K.), and cloud-native connectivity companies Ban-\nzai Cloud (Hungary) and Portshift (Israel) in 2020.33 In 2022, Cisco made a bold move in offering \n$20 billion for Splunk (U.S.), which makes software to monitor and analyze data.34\n7-2b Overcoming Entry Barriers\nBarriers to entry (introduced in Chapter 2) are factors associated with a market, or the firms cur-\nrently operating in it, that increase the expense and difficulty new firms encounter when trying to \nenter a particular market.35 For example, well-established competitors may have economies of scale \nin manufacturing or servicing their products. In addition, enduring relationships with customers \noften create loyalties and customer information that are difficult for new entrants to overcome.36 \nWhen facing a market with highly differentiated products, new entrants typically must spend \nconsiderable resources to advertise their products and may find it necessary, at first, to sell below \ncompetitors’ prices to entice new customers.\nFacing the entry barriers that economies of scale and differentiated products create, a new \nentrant may find that acquiring an established company is more effective than entering the mar-\nket as a competitor offering a product that is unfamiliar to current buyers. In fact, the higher the \nbarriers to market entry, the greater the probability that a firm will acquire an existing firm to \novercome them. Often entry barriers are highest for firms that desire to enter a foreign market.37 \nConsequently, cross-border acquisitions are a common way to overcome them.\nCross-Border Acquisitions\nAcquisitions made between companies with headquarters in different countries are called \ncross-border acquisitions.38 Historically, North American and European companies were the most \nactive acquirers of companies outside their domestic markets. However, today’s global competitive \nlandscape is one in which firms from economies throughout the world are engaging in cross-border \nacquisitions. In fact, in 2022, it is estimated that there will be approximately as many cross-border \nacquisitions in the Asia Pacific region as there will be in North America.39\nFirms should recognize that cross-border acquisitions tend to have high risks and should be \npursued with caution, even when a strong strategic rationale under-girds the completed transac-\ntions. One of the risks is associated with the high level of corruption that may exist in the country \nin which the target company is based.40 Executives from firms that operate in developed economies \nmay have difficulty in acquiring and managing a target firm in a country in which bribes and dis-\nhonesty are commonplace. There are also cultural differences across countries that can make man-\naging a cross-border acquisition difficult.41 In addition, deals can be delayed or canceled because \ncustomers, employees, media, or regulators in the target firm’s country may be suspicious of the \nacquiring firm, thinking that perhaps the welfare of important stakeholders will be reduced or that \nthe firm will act as a poor corporate citizen, neglecting its social responsibilities.42\nChina is a country that, because of its size and technological expertise, can be very attractive \nto potential acquirers from other countries. Political and legal obstacles associated with green-\nfield ventures can encourage foreign firms to use acquisitions to overcome barriers to entry when \nentering China, but they also increase the risk of doing so.43 Being able to conduct an effective \ndue-diligence process when acquiring a company in China can be difficult because the target firm’s \nfinancial data and corporate governance practices may lack complete transparency. \nHowever, difficulty goes both ways, because Chinese acquisitions of foreign firms have not had \na stellar record. As a result, Chinese regulators hesitate to approve cross-border deals, especially if \nthe acquiring firm has no expertise in managing the potential target business. For instance, Anbang \nA related acquisition \noccurs when a firm acquires \nanother firm in a highly \nrelated industry.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Compared with internal product \ndevelopment processes, acquisitions provide more predictable costs, as well as faster market entry. \nCelanese, a chemical-based materials firm, seeks to improve its engineered materials business \nin the United States through both acquisitions and internal innovation as it develops a portfolio of \nmaterials and resins to more fully meet its customers’ emerging needs. It has found that in some \nchanging areas it can more quickly gain access to products that are related to its own and that target \nthe changing needs of historic customers. For example, the company was interested in entering \ninto the emerging autonomous vehicle market. It purchased Nilit Plastics, a deal that increased the \ncompany’s nylon compounding capability, so Celanese can now design and provide the plastics \nused to make the housings for the large number of sensors and cameras that autonomous vehicles \nuse. Celanese also bought DuPont’s mobility and materials business for $11 billion in its largest \nacquisition ever.46 \n7-2d Lower Risk Compared to Developing New Products\nBecause an estimated 88 percent of innovations fail to achieve adequate returns, concerns exist in \nfirms about their ability to achieve adequate returns from the capital they invest to develop and \ncommercialize new products. These types of outcomes may lead managers to perceive internal \nproduct development as a high-risk activity.47\nThe outcomes of an acquisition can be estimated more easily and accurately than the outcomes \nof an internal product development process; as such, managers may view acquisitions as less risky.48 \nHowever, firms should be cautious: even though research suggests acquisition strategies are a com-\nmon means of avoiding risky internal ventures (and therefore risky R&D investments), acquisitions \nmay also become a substitute for internal innovation.49\nOver time, being dependent on others for innovation leaves a firm vulnerable and less capable \nof mastering its own destiny when it comes to using innovation as a driver of wealth creation. Thus, \na clear strategic rationale, should drive each acquisition a firm chooses to complete. If a firm is \nbeing acquired to gain access to a specific innovation or to a target’s innovation-related capabilities, \nthe acquiring firm should be able to specify how the innovation is or the innovation-based skills are \nto be integrated with its operations for strategic purposes.50\n7-2e Increased Diversification\nAcquisitions are also used to diversify firms. Based on experience and the insights resulting from \nit, firms typically find it easier to develop and introduce new products in markets they are cur-\nrently serving. In contrast, it is difficult for companies to develop products that differ from their \ncurrent lines for markets in which they lack experience. Thus, it is relatively uncommon for a firm \nto develop entirely new products internally to diversify its product lines.51\nAcquisition strategies can be used to support the use of both related and unrelated diversifi-\ncation strategies. In an example of related diversification, Alphabet (Google) bought Mandiant, a \ncybersecurity company, for nearly $5.4 billion in 2022. Explaining the acquisition, Thomas Kurian, \nchief executive of Google Cloud, said, “Google wants to draw from Mandiant insights into how it \napplies security solutions to its products and that it intends to retain the Mandiant brand.”52 The \nacquisition will give Alphabet a much stronger position in cloud technology.\nSamsung Group, a huge conglomerate, uses an unrelated diversification strategy to further \ndiversify its operations. Headquartered in Suwon, South Korea, Samsung’s portfolio recently \nincluded almost 70 companies competing in unrelated areas such as electronics, construction, \nlife insurance, and fashion. It is South Korea’s largest chaebol, or business conglomerate. Samsung \nElectronics, one of the firm’s three core units, features three businesses that are well known to \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In 2017, Samsung bought Harman, focused on automotive and audio electronics. The \nmove signaled an interest in expansion into automotive markets, industrial automation, and digital \nhealth. In 2020, Samsung bought network services provider TeleWorld to improve its end-to-end \nnetwork support and help with the 5G rollout in the United States. Then, in late 2021, Samsung was \nin talks to acquire Biogen Inc., a pharmaceutical firm that had recently received approval of a new \nAlzheimer treatment in the United States.53\nFirms using acquisition strategies should be aware that, in general, the more related the acquired \nfirm is to the acquiring firm, the greater is the probability that the acquisition will be successful. Thus, \nhorizontal acquisitions and related acquisitions tend to contribute more to the firm’s strategic com-\npetitiveness than do acquisitions of companies operating in product markets that differ from those in \nwhich the acquiring firm competes. Nonetheless, the unrelated diversification strategy, such as the one \nSamsung is implementing, can also lead to success when used in ways that enhance firm value.\n7-2f \nReshaping the Firm’s Competitive Scope\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, the intensity of competitive rivalry is an industry characteristic that affects \na firm’s profitability. To reduce the negative effect of an intense rivalry on financial performance, firms \nmay use acquisitions to lessen their product and/or market dependencies.54 Reducing a company’s \ndependence on specific products or markets reshapes the firm’s competitive scope. For example, in the \nhighly competitive digital learning industry, Byju has made several acquisitions to increase the scope \nof its offerings. One of the more recent of these acquisitions was the 2021 purchase of the Austrian \nmath-learning company GeoGebra. Byju expects that the acquisition will enable the creation of new \nproducts for its product portfolio, which will lessen the company’s dependence on any one product.55\nAnother example is Carvana’s acquisition of ADESA U.S. for $2.2 billion in 2022.56 Carvana is \nknown in the United States for its home delivery and car towers that stack dozens of used cars on top \nof each other. The used car market is incredibly competitive, with the powerhouse CarMax accom-\npanied by AutoNation and a wide variety of other national, regional, and local dealers. ADESA is a \npublic auction primarily for licensed car and specialty dealers. Adding auto auctions increases the \nscope of Carvana’s operations. Note also that this is a form of vertical integration that can increase \nCarvana’s market power. It is not unusual for a firm to make an acquisition for more than one of the \nreasons we have discussed in this section. Indeed, it is probably the norm rather than the exception.\n7-2g Learning and Developing New Capabilities\nFirms sometimes complete acquisitions to gain access to capabilities they lack. For example, firms \noften acquire technology-oriented companies to accelerate their innovation processes.57 Research \nshows that firms can broaden their knowledge base and reduce inertia (e.g., resistance to change) \nthrough acquisitions and that they increase the potential of their capabilities when they acquire \ndiverse talent through cross-border acquisitions.58 Of \ncourse, firms are better able to learn these acquired \ncapabilities if they share some similar properties with \nthe firm’s current capabilities.59 Thus, firms should seek \nto acquire companies with different but related and \ncomplementary capabilities as a path to building their \nown knowledge base.60 \nAs an example of an acquisition that led to new \ncapabilities, Uniphore Software Systems acquired Emo-\ntion Research Lab to add video artificial intelligence \n(AI) capabilities to its software portfolio.61 The result is \nimpressive. The company’s vision is to be “the defining \nconversational AI and automation platform to realize \nthe value of every enterprise conversation.”62 They have \ncombined voice AI, computer vision, and tonal emotion \ninto what they call a conversational automation plat-\nform that allows accurate, personalized, and automated \nconversations, regardless of which language or dialect \nCarvana’s 2022 acquisition of ADESA U.S. will allow them to operate in \n56 ADESA U.S. locations.\nEric Glenn/Shutterstock.com\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The company’s dual headquarters are in India and the \nSilicon Valley in the United States, with additional offices in Spain, Japan, Singapore, and Israel. \nIn another example, in response to the highly competitive oil industry environment, and \npressure from stakeholders to invest in “green” energy, Chevron paid over $3 billion to acquire \nRenewable Energy Group, a company that makes renewable fuels. Renewable Energy makes diesel \nand other fuels from sources such as cooking oil or corn. This acquisition gives Chevron a much-\nneeded capability in an area that is only going to be even more important in the future. Chief Exec-\nutive Mike Worth explained it this way: “We’re creating a system here, not just buying a business \nto plug in. It is building capabilities to do things that are very analogous to what we’ve historically \ndone, with a wide variety of feedstocks.” 63\n7-3 Problems in Achieving Acquisition Success\nEffective and appropriate use of the acquisition strategies discussed in this chapter can facilitate \nfirms’ efforts to earn above-average returns. However, even when pursued for value-creating rea-\nsons, acquisition strategies are not problem-free. Reasons for the use of acquisition strategies and \npotential problems with such strategies are shown in Figure 7.1.\nLearning Objective\n7-3 Describe seven \nproblems that work \nagainst achieving \nsuccess when using an \nacquisition strategy.\nReasons for Acquisitions\nOvercoming\nentry barriers\nCost of new\nproduct development\nand increased speed to\nmarket\nLearning and\ndeveloping new\ncapabilities\nLower risk\ncompared to developing\nnew products\nIncreased\ndiversification\nReshaping the firm’s\ncompetitive scope\nLarge or\nextraordinary debt\nIntegration\ndifficulties\nInadequate\nevaluation of target\nInability to\nachieve synergy\nToo much\ndiversification\nManagers overly\nfocused on acquisitions\nToo large\nProblems in Achieving Success\nIncreased\nmarket power\nFigure 7.1 Reasons for Acquisitions and Problems in Achieving Success \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Later, \nwe will discuss several attributes that are associated with successful acquisitions (the attributes \nappear in Table 7.1). Despite this increasing success, firms using acquisition strategies should be \naware of problems that tend to affect acquisition success so that they can avoid them, if possible. \nWe show these problems in Figure 7.1 and discuss them next.\n7-3a Integration Difficulties\nThe importance of a successful integration should not be underestimated.65 Indeed, some believe \nthat the integration process is the strongest determinant of whether an acquisition will be suc-\ncessful. This belief highlights the fact that post-acquisition integration is often a complex set of \norganizational processes that is difficult and challenging. The processes tend to generate uncer-\ntainty and often resistance because of cultural clashes and organizational politics.66 How people \nare treated during the integration process relative to perceptions of fairness, openness of commu-\nnications, and recognition of emotional needs is important when trying to integrate the acquiring \nand acquired firms.67 Among the challenges associated with integration processes are the need to:\n\t\n●\nmeld two or more unique corporate cultures\n\t\n●\nlink different financial and information control systems\n\t\n●\nbuild effective working relationships (particularly when management styles differ)\n\t\n●\ndetermine the leadership structure and those who will fill it for the integrated firm.68\n7-3b Inadequate Evaluation of Target\nDue diligence is a process through which a potential acquirer evaluates a target firm for acquisi-\ntion.69 In an effective due-diligence process, hundreds of items are examined in areas as diverse \nas the financing for the intended transaction, differences in cultures between the acquiring and \ntarget firm, tax consequences of the transaction, pending legal suits, backgrounds of key man-\nagers, contracts, and actions that would be necessary to successfully meld the two workforces. \nIt is also important to determine whether the target firm has any poison pills that will become \neffective if an acquisition takes place.70 First mentioned in Chapter 6, poison pills are mecha-\nnisms put into place to discourage potential acquirers. The golden parachute was described in \nChapter 6. Another type of poison pill allows investors to acquire additional shares in a company \nif a would-be acquirer takes a significant stake in the company’s stock with the intention of taking \nit over.71 \nDue diligence is commonly performed with the assistance of investment bankers such as Deut-\nsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, as well as accountants, lawyers, and management \nconsultants specializing in that activity, although firms actively pursuing acquisitions may form \ntheir own internal due-diligence team. Even in instances when a company does its own due dil-\nigence, companies typically work with intermediaries such as large investment banks to facilitate \ntheir due-diligence efforts. Interestingly, research suggests that acquisition performance increases \nwith the number of due-diligence–related transactions facilitated by an investment bank, but \ndecreases when the relationship with a particular investment bank becomes exclusive.72 Research \nalso finds that when there is geographic overlap in the operational activities of the acquiring and \ntarget firms, informal due diligence between the deal firms is facilitated.73 Because due diligence \nadds costs to an acquisition process, firms need to balance the need for more information during \nthe due diligence process with the costs of acquiring that information.74 Thus, the due diligence \nprocess is a complex matter requiring careful managerial attention.\nAlthough a lot of the due diligence effort often focuses on evaluating the accuracy of the finan-\ncial position and accounting standards used (a financial audit), due diligence also needs to examine \nthe quality of the strategic fit and the ability of the acquiring firm to effectively integrate the target \nto realize the potential gains from the deal.75 A comprehensive due-diligence process reduces the \nlikelihood that an acquiring firm will have the experience Teva did as a result of acquiring Actavis \nGenerics from Allergan for $40.5 billion.

However, before this occurs, the potential acquirer needs to estimate the size \nof premium over market value it is willing to pay for the target company. Firms are willing to \npay a premium to acquire a company they believe will increase their ability to earn above-average \nreturns. Determining the precise premium that is appropriate to pay is challenging.78 While the \nacquirer can estimate the value of anticipated synergies, it is just that—an estimate. Only after \nworking to integrate the firms and then engaging in competitive actions in the marketplace will \nthe real value of synergies be known. When firms overestimate the value of synergies or the value \nof future growth potential associated with an acquisition, the premium they pay may prove to be \ntoo large.79 The managerial challenge is to effectively examine each acquisition target in order to \ndetermine the amount of premium that is appropriate for the acquiring firm to pay.80\n7-3c \nLarge or Extraordinary Debt\nTo finance several the acquisitions completed during the 1980s and 1990s, some companies sig-\nnificantly increased their debt levels. Although firms today are more prudent about the amount \nof debt they are willing to accept to complete an acquisition, those evaluating the possibility of an \nacquisition need to be aware of the problem that taking on too much debt can create. In this sense, \nfirms using an acquisition strategy want to verify that their purchases do not create a debt load that \noverpowers their ability to remain solvent and vibrant as a competitor.\nA financial innovation called junk bonds supported firms’ earlier efforts to take on large \namounts of debt when completing acquisitions. Junk bonds, which are used less frequently today \nand are now more commonly called high-yield bonds, are a financing option through which risky \nacquisitions are financed with debt (bonds) that provides a large potential return to lenders (bond-\nholders).81 Because junk bonds are unsecured obligations that are not tied to specific assets for \ncollateral, interest rates for these high-risk debt instruments sometimes reached between 18 and \n20 percent during the 1980s.82 Additionally, interest rates for these types of bonds tend to be quite \nvolatile, a condition that potentially exposes companies to greater financial risk.83 \nSome financial economists view debt as a means to discipline managers, causing the managers \nto act in the shareholders’ best interests.84 The logic is that because the firm is heavily indebted, \nmanagers must exercise more care in making decisions or the firm will potentially fail. However, \nthe perspective that debt disciplines managers is not as widely supported today as it was in the \npast.85\nBidding wars, through which an acquiring firm often overcommits to the decision to acquire \na target, can result in large or extraordinary debt. While finance theory suggests that managers \nwill make rational decisions when seeking to complete an acquisition, other research suggests that \nrationality may not always drive the acquisition decision. Managerial hubris (e.g., managers believe \nthey can manage the target better than the last team), escalation of commitment to complete a \nparticular transaction, and self-interest sometimes influence executives to pay a large premium, \nwhich, in turn, may result in taking on too much debt to acquire a target.86 Excessive debt can make \nmanagers risk averse, which could reduce their willingness to invest in other risky activities that are \nessential to future performance, such as new research and development projects.\n7-3d Inability to Achieve Synergy\nDerived from synergos, a Greek word that means “working together,” synergy exists when the \nvalue created by units working together exceeds the value that those units could create working \nindependently (see Chapter 6).87 That is, synergy exists when assets are worth more when used in \nconjunction with each other than when they are used separately. For shareholders, synergy gen-\nerates gains in their wealth that they could not duplicate or exceed through their own portfolio \ndiversification decisions.88 Synergy is created by the efficiencies derived from economies of scale \nand economies of scope and by sharing resources (e.g., human capital and knowledge) across the \nbusinesses in the newly created firm’s portfolio.89\nA firm develops a competitive advantage through an acquisition strategy only when a trans-\naction generates private synergy. Private synergy is created when combining and integrating the \nacquiring and acquired firms’ assets yield capabilities and core competencies that could not be \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Private synergy \nis possible when firms’ assets are complementary in unique ways; that is, the unique type of asset \ncomplementarity is not always possible simply by combining two companies’ sets of assets with \neach other.90 Although difficult to create, the attractiveness of private synergy is that because of its \nuniqueness, it is difficult for competitors to understand and imitate, meaning that a competitive \nadvantage results for the firms able to create it.\nA firm’s ability to account for costs that are necessary to create anticipated revenue and \ncost-based synergies affects its efforts to create private synergy. Firms experience several \nexpenses when seeking to create synergy through acquisitions. Called transaction costs, these \nexpenses are incurred when firms use acquisition strategies to create synergy.91 Transaction \ncosts may be direct or indirect. Direct costs include legal fees and charges from investment \nbankers who complete due diligence for the acquiring firm. Indirect costs include manage-\nrial time to evaluate target firms and then to complete negotiations, as well as the loss of \ntop executives, managers and employees following an acquisition.92 In 2019, French financial \ngiant AXA SA acquired XL Group Ltd. to form the largest global property insurance company. \nAlthough Thomas Buberl, AXA CEO, justified the acquisition based on synergies on the “cost \nside and on the capital side,” the market responded with skepticism. One analysis said, “From \nmy calls with investors so far, they all point to three things: wrong asset, wrong timing and \nwrong price.” At the time of the announcement, AXA was paying a 33 percent premium for \nthe transaction.93 Often firms tend to underestimate the sum of indirect costs when specifying \nthe value of the synergy that may be created by integrating the acquired firm’s assets with the \nacquiring firm’s assets.\n7-3e Too Much Diversification\nAs explained in Chapter 6, diversification strategies, when used effectively, can help a firm earn \nabove-average returns. In general, firms using related diversification strategies outperform those \nemploying unrelated diversification strategies. However, conglomerates formed by using an unre-\nlated diversification strategy can also be successful.\nAt some point, however, firms can become overdiversified. The level at which this happens var-\nies across companies because each firm has different capabilities to manage diversification. Recall \nfrom Chapter 6 that related diversification requires more information processing than does unre-\nlated diversification. Because of this need to process additional amounts of information, related \ndiversified firms become overdiversified with a smaller number of business units than do firms \nusing an unrelated diversification strategy.94 Regardless of the type of diversification strategy imple-\nmented, however, the firm that becomes overdiversified will experience a decline in its perfor-\nmance and likely a decision to divest some of its units.95 Commonly, such divestments, which tend \nto reshape a firm’s competitive scope, are part of a firm’s restructuring strategy. (Restructuring is \ndiscussed in greater detail later in the chapter.)\nEven when a firm is not overdiversified, a high level of diversification can have a negative \neffect on its long-term performance. For example, the scope created by additional amounts of \ndiversification often causes managers to rely on financial rather than strategic controls to evalu-\nate business units’ performance (financial and strategic controls are discussed in Chapters 11 and \n12). Top-level executives often rely on financial controls to assess the performance of business \nunits when they do not have a rich understanding of business units’ objectives and strategies. \nUsing financial controls, such as return on investment (ROI), causes individual business-unit \nmanagers to focus on short-term outcomes at the expense of long-term investments. Reducing \nlong-term investments to generate short-term profits can negatively affect a firm’s overall perfor-\nmance ability.96\nAnother problem resulting from overdiversification, mentioned previously in this chapter, is \nthe tendency for acquisitions to become substitutes for innovation.97 Although managers may have \nno interest in acquisitions substituting for internal R&D efforts, a reinforcing cycle can evolve. \nCosts associated with acquisitions may result in fewer allocations to activities, such as R&D, that \nare linked to innovation. Without adequate support, a firm’s innovation skills begin to atrophy. \nWithout internal innovation skills, a key option available to a firm to gain access to innovation is \nto complete additional acquisitions. Evidence suggests that a firm using acquisitions as a substitute \nfor internal innovations eventually encounters performance problems.98\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Activities with which managers become involved include:\n\t\n●\nsearching for viable acquisition candidates\n\t\n●\ncompleting effective due-diligence processes\n\t\n●\npreparing for negotiations\n\t\n●\nmanaging the integration process after completing the acquisition\nTop-level executives do not personally gather all the information and data required to make acqui-\nsitions. However, they do make critical decisions regarding the targeted firms, the nature of the nego-\ntiations, and so forth.99 In fact, research indicates that the knowledge and skills possessed by a CEO \ninfluence what kind of acquisitions the firm will seek (e.g., unrelated or related).100 This evidence shows \nhow much top executives are involved in the acquisition process. Company experiences show that \nparticipating in and overseeing the activities required for making acquisitions can divert managerial \nattention from other matters that are necessary for long-term competitive success, such as identifying \nand taking advantage of other opportunities and interacting with important external stakeholders.101\nBoth theory and research suggest that managers can become overly involved in the process of \nmaking acquisitions.102 One observer suggested, “some executives can become preoccupied with \nmaking deals—and the thrill of selecting, chasing, and seizing a target.”103 The over-involvement \ncan be surmounted by learning from mistakes and by not having too much agreement in the board-\nroom. Dissent is helpful to make sure that all sides of a question are considered.104 For example, \nresearch suggests that CEOs who are not challenged substantially in their decision making, either \nby the CFO or the board, realize more value destructive acquisitions.105 When failure does occur, \nleaders may be tempted to blame the failure on others and on unforeseen circumstances rather than \non their excessive involvement in the acquisition process. Finding the appropriate degree of involve-\nment with the firm’s acquisition strategy is a challenging, yet important, task for top-level managers.\n7-3g Too Large\nMost acquisitions result in a larger firm, which should create or enhance economies of scale. In \nturn, scale economies can lead to more efficient operations—for example, two sales organizations \ncan be integrated using fewer sales representatives because the combined sales force can sell the \nproducts of both firms (particularly if the products of the acquiring and target firms are highly \nrelated).106 However, size can also increase the complexity of the managerial challenge and create \ndiseconomies of scale—that is, not enough economic benefit to outweigh the costs of managing \nthe more complex organization created through acquisitions.\nThus, while many firms seek increases in size because of the potential economies of scale and \nenhanced market power size creates, at some level, the additional costs required to manage the \nlarger firm will exceed the benefits of the economies of scale and additional market power. The \ncomplexities generated by the larger size often lead managers to implement more bureaucratic con-\ntrols to manage the combined firm’s operations. Bureaucratic controls are formalized supervisory \nand behavioral rules and policies designed to ensure consistency of decisions and actions across a \nfirm’s units. However, across time, formalized controls often lead to relatively rigid and standard-\nized managerial behavior which, at high levels, can hurt performance.107 \nCertainly, in the long run, the diminished flexibility that accompanies rigid and standardized \nmanagerial behavior can produce less innovation.108 Because innovation is important to perfor-\nmance, the bureaucratic controls resulting from increased size due, in part, to an acquisition strategy, \ncan negatively affect a firm’s performance. Thus, although managers may decide their firm should \ncomplete acquisitions in the pursuit of increased size as a path to profitable growth, they should \navoid allowing their firm to grow to a point where acquisitions are actually hurting performance.\n7-4 Effective Acquisitions\nAs noted, many acquisition strategies do not lead to above-average returns for the acquiring firm’s \nshareholders. Nonetheless, some companies can create value when using an acquisition strategy. \nResearch evidence suggests that the probability of being able to create value through acquisitions \nLearning Objective\n7-4 Describe the \nattributes of effective \nacquisitions. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In fact, integrating two firms with complementary assets frequently produces \nunique capabilities and core competencies. With complementary assets, the acquiring firm can \nmaintain its focus on core businesses and leverage the complementary assets and capabilities from \nthe acquired firm.110 In effective acquisitions, targets are often selected and “groomed” by establish-\ning a working relationship prior to the acquisition.111\nResearch evidence also shows that friendly acquisitions facilitate integration of the acquiring \nand acquired firms. Of course, a target firm’s positive reaction to a bid from the acquiring firm \nincreases the likelihood that a friendly transaction will take place. After completing a friendly \nacquisition, firms collaborate to create synergy while integrating their operations with more speed \nthan hostile acquisitions.112 Friendly deals also allow for easier leadership and operational combi-\nnations and thus facilitate the ability to create synergy in the integration process.\nAdditionally, effective due-diligence processes involving the deliberate and careful selection of \ntarget firms and an evaluation of the relative health of those firms (financial health, cultural fit, and \nthe value of human resources) contribute to successful acquisitions.113 Financial slack in the form of \ndebt equity or cash, in both the acquiring and acquired firms, also frequently contributes to acqui-\nsition success.114 Even though financial slack provides access to financing for the acquisition, it is \nstill important to maintain a low or moderate level of debt after the acquisition to keep debt costs \nlow. When substantial debt is used to finance acquisitions, companies with successful acquisitions \nreduce the debt quickly, partly by selling off assets from the acquired firm, especially noncomple-\nmentary or poorly performing assets. For these firms, debt costs do not preclude long-term invest-\nments in areas such as R&D, and managerial discretion in the use of cash flow is relatively flexible.\nAnother attribute of successful acquisition strategies is an emphasis on innovation, as demon-\nstrated by continuing investments in R&D activities.115 One of the government concerns about the \nBroadcom acquisition of Qualcomm was that Broadcom has not had a strong tradition of R&D \ninvestment after its past acquisitions and Qualcomm, as a leader in 5G network implementation, \nwould need strong innovation investment to maintain that leadership.116\nFlexibility and adaptability are the final two attributes of successful acquisitions. When execu-\ntives of both the acquiring and the target firms have experience in managing change and learning \nfrom acquisitions, they are more skilled at adapting their capabilities to new environments.117 As \nTable 7.1 Attributes of Successful Acquisitions\nAttributes\nResults\n1.

Sometimes, though, the results of an acquisition strategy fall short of expec-\ntations. When this happens, firms consider using restructuring strategies.\n7-5 Restructuring\nRestructuring is a strategy through which a firm changes its set of businesses or its financial \nstructure.118 Restructuring is a global phenomenon that is increasing in importance.119 Historically, \ndivesting businesses from company portfolios and downsizing (e.g., layoffs) have accounted for a \nlarge percentage of firms’ restructuring strategies. Firms often focus on fewer products and mar-\nkets following restructuring. In some cases, huge, highly diversified companies split into multiple \nsmaller companies, as in the cases of General Electric and Toshiba—they both intend to divide into \nthree separate companies.120\nAlthough restructuring strategies are generally used to deal with acquisitions that are not \nreaching expectations, firms sometimes use restructuring strategies because of changes they have \ndetected in their external environment. For example, Johnson & Johnson plans to split into two \nseparate companies—consumer products, and pharmaceuticals and medical devices—believing \nthat the two companies acting separately will be able to address the needs and challenges of their \nvery different industry environments than would the combined company if it remains whole.121 In \na case like this one, restructuring may be appropriate to position the firm to create more value for \nstakeholders.122\nResearch shows that a lot of executives “hold onto businesses that, once critical to a portfolio, \nare now an unnecessary draw on resources and utilization of capital that could be better deployed \nelsewhere.”123 However, activist investors can put a lot of pressure on firms to either restructure or \nto put themselves up for sale. These are investors that hold a significant, but not controlling, interest \nin the firm’s stock. They use their positions to gain board seats and make shareholder proposals \nregarding what the firm can do to enhance shareholder returns.124 For example, activist investor \nMill Road Capital Management, which owns a 5.1 percent stake in discount retailer Big Lots, is \npressuring the company to put itself up for sale.125 The Strategic Focus on Unilever’s restructuring \nplans demonstrates a lot of the topic covered in this section, including the influence of an activist \ninvestor. Activist investors will be discussed in more depth in Chapter 10.\nFirms typically engage in three types of restructuring strategies: downsizing, downscoping, and \nleveraged buyouts. The first two of these strategies, and often the third as well, involve divesting \nbusinesses. There are several common ways to divest a business. One is the complete sell-off, in \nwhich a firm sells a business (or several) directly to another firm. For example, Bayer AG sold its \npest-control unit to a private-equity firm, Cinven, for $2.6 billion.126 Another is the spin-off, in \nwhich the firm that owns the business that is being divested creates an independent company by \neither selling new shares of stock in the spun off business or giving shareholders stock in the spun \noff business proportional to the amount of stock they own in the parent company. AT&T spun \noff its WarnerMedia division so it can concentrate on building more fiber-optic lines.127 Similarly, \nthe Japanese conglomerate Toshiba decided to spin off its devices business, which includes semi-\nconductors, in an effort to increase shareholder returns.128 Divestitures such as these often lead to \nhigher financial performance for the firm that engages in them.129 In addition, researchers also \nfound that they can enhance the firm’s corporate social responsibility performance, perhaps by \nproviding more liquid resources such as cash to allocate to these sorts of activities.130 Also, firms \nthat are more stakeholder-oriented are less likely to engage in divestitures.131 This makes sense \ngiven that organizational changes associated with a divestiture can harm stakeholders, especially \nthose of the divested business.\nAnother form of divestiture, albeit an incomplete form, is called a carve-out, in which the parent \ncompany sells only a partial interest in the company to investors, but keeps a large stake, or con-\ntrolling interest, in the carved-out company. Discussed previously in this chapter, Intel’s announce-\nment that it would be taking its Mobileye business unit public is an example of a carve-out. Intel \nwill retain control of the company. Research indicates that parents pursuing a sell-off perform \nbetter than the parents of carve-outs.132\nLearning Objective\n7-5 Distinguish among \nthe common forms of \nrestructuring strategies.\nActivist investors hold \na significant, but not \ncontrolling, interest in the \nfirm’s stock. They use their \npositions to gain board \nseats and make shareholder \nproposals regarding what \nthe firm can do to enhance \nshareholder returns.\nRestructuring is a strategy \nthrough which a firm changes \nits set of businesses or its \nfinancial structure.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The company has \ndiversified its product offerings primarily through dozens of acquisitions. \nAt the beginning of 2022, the company employed about 149,000 people \naround the world.\nRecently, Unilever has been criticized for slow growth compared \nto its competitors, even during the pandemic when the company’s \npackaged goods were in high demand. Analysts have also been criti-\ncal of the company’s resistance to divest slow-growth businesses and \nits lack of innovation for consumers. In a bold move to accelerate \ngrowth, Unilever surprised shareholders with an announcement of a \n$68 billion bid for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer healthcare business in \nJanuary 2022. Glaxo owns popular consumer brands like Aquafresh \ntoothpaste and Advil analgesic. The bid was rejected as too low, and \nUnilever dropped its acquisition plans because of shareholder discon-\ntent and analyst criticism.\nIn January 2022, they announced a reorganization plan “aimed \nat improving its agility and increasing accountability for its different \nbusinesses.” The plan included cutting thousands of jobs as well as \nboth acquisitions and divestitures. A new organization structure effec-\ntive in July created five stand-alone divisions, requiring a shuffling of \nexecutives around the company. The new structure was expected \nto reduce costs by 600 million euros over a period of two years and \nalso improve sales growth. Alan Jope, CEO of Unilever, said about the \nrestructuring: “Growth remains our top priority and these changes will \nunderpin our pursuit of this.”\nUnilever intends to expand more into faster growing health, beauty \nand hygiene markets, while de-emphasizing food brands that are slower \ngrowing. However, inflation has made the turnaround even more diffi-\ncult, with operating margins expected to drop up to 2.4 percent in 2022. \nIn response to the dropping margins, Jope said that big acquisitions are \nno longer being considered as a part of the restructuring.\nNelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management acquired a stake in Unilever \nshortly after its failed bid for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer healthcare \nbusiness. The activist investor immediately began putting pressure on \nUnilever’s chief executive, Alan Jope. An analyst at Barclays, Warren \nAckerman, said, “From Unilever’s perspective, the status quo is not an \noption. It would seem that the stars are aligning with both Unilever \nmanagement and an activist pushing for more urgency.” Only time \nwill tell if Unilever’s reorganization is a success.\nSources: C.

Unilever’s restructuring plan, discussed in the Strategic Focus, included \ndownsizing through layoffs of thousands of employees. Thus, downsizing is an intentional mana-\ngerial strategy that is used with the intention of improving firm performance. In contrast, organi-\nzational decline, which too often results in a reduction of a firm’s resources—including the number \nof its employees and potentially in the number of its units—is an unintentional outcome of what \nturned out to be a firm’s ineffective competitive actions.133 \nWhen downsizing, firms make intentional decisions about resources to retain and resources \nto eliminate. Organizational decline, on the other hand, finds firms losing access to an array of \nresources, many of which are critical to current and future performance. Thus, downsizing is a \nlegitimate strategy to appropriately adjust firm size and is not necessarily a sign of organizational \ndecline.134 However, a downsizing firm still risks losing essential resources, such as skilled employ-\nees or productive assets, that are important to its ability to compete.135\nDownsizing can be an appropriate strategy to use after completing an acquisition, particularly \nwhen there are significant operational and/or strategic relationships between the acquiring and the \nDownsizing is a reduction \nin the number of a firm’s \nemployees and, sometimes, \nin the number of its operating \nunits.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In these instances, the newly formed firm may have excess capacity in functional \nareas such as sales, manufacturing, distribution, human resource management, and so forth. In \nturn, excess capacity may prevent the combined firm from realizing anticipated synergies and the \nreduced costs associated with them.136 Managers should remember that, as a strategy, downsizing \nwill be far more effective when they consistently use human resource practices that ensure proce-\ndural justice and fairness in downsizing decisions.137\n7-5b Downscoping\nDownscoping refers to divestiture, spin-off, or some other means of eliminating businesses \nthat are unrelated to a firm’s core businesses. Downscoping has a more positive effect on firm \nperformance than does downsizing because firms commonly find that downscoping causes \nthem to refocus on their core business.138 “Selling business units that no longer fit the com-\npany strategy—but that could be attractive additions to another company’s portfolio—releases \ncapital, which can then be deployed to strengthen the retained businesses or to acquire new \nbusinesses more aligned to a company’s chosen direction.”139 Managerial effectiveness increases \nbecause the firm has become less diversified, allowing the top management team to better \nunderstand and manage the remaining businesses.140 Also, research shows that the quality \nof innovation (e.g., probability of a major breakthrough) of pharmaceutical firms increases \nsubsequent to divestiture, likely a result of being able to focus on what remains in a firm’s \ntechnological portfolio.141\nFirms often use the downscoping and downsizing strategies simultaneously. As noted above, \ndownsizing firms need to avoid losing key employees or other resources that are important to \ncompetitiveness. Instead, a firm that chooses simultaneously to engage in downscoping and down-\nsizing should intentionally become smaller as a result of decisions made to reduce the diversity of \nbusinesses in its portfolio, allowing it to focus on its core areas.142\n7-5c \nLeveraged Buyouts\nA leveraged buyout (LBO) is a restructuring strategy whereby another company is purchased \nusing a significant amount of debt to pay for the acquisition.143 This is also called taking a company \nprivate because the company’s stock is no longer publicly traded. At present, private equity firms \nare often the orchestrators of a leveraged buyout.144 These firms get their capital from high-new-\nworth individuals and institutional investors who are trying to achieve higher returns than public \nequity markets provide.145 LBOs can also be conducted by mangers (or even one manager) of the \nfirm, or sometimes by a group of firm employees.\nTraditionally, leveraged buyouts were used as a restructuring strategy to correct for managerial \nmistakes or because the firm’s managers were making decisions that primarily served their own \ninterests rather than those of shareholders.146 However, some firms complete leveraged buyouts \nfor the purpose of building firm resources and expanding their operations rather than simply to \nrestructure a distressed firm’s assets.\nTo support debt repayments and to downscope the company so it can concentrate on its core \nbusinesses, the new owners may quickly sell several assets. It is not uncommon for those buying \na firm through an LBO to restructure the firm to the point that it can be sold at a profit within a \nfive- to eight-year period. Indeed, the point at which this happens is typically when the investors \nwho orchestrated the LBO get their big payout.\nResearch shows that some LBOs lead to downscoping, increased strategic focus, and improved \nperformance.147 Research also shows that management buyouts can lead to greater entrepreneurial \nactivity and growth.148 As such, LBOs can represent a form of firm rebirth to facilitate entrepre-\nneurial efforts and stimulate strategic growth and productivity.149\n7-6 Restructuring Outcomes\nThe short- and long-term outcomes that result from use of the three restructuring strategies \nare shown in Figure 7.2. As indicated, downsizing typically does not lead to higher firm per-\nformance.150 In fact, some research results show that downsizing contributes to lower returns \nLearning Objective\n7-6 Explain the short- \nand long-term outcomes \nof the different types of \nrestructuring strategies.\nA leveraged buyout (LBO) \nis a restructuring strategy \nwhereby another company is \npurchased using a significant \namount of debt to pay for the \nacquisition.\nDownscoping refers to \ndivestiture, spin-off, or some \nother means of eliminating \nbusinesses that are unrelated \nto a firm’s core businesses.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The stock markets in the firms’ respective nations evaluate \ndownsizing negatively, believing that it has long-term negative effects on the firms’ efforts \nto achieve strategic competitiveness. Investors also seem to conclude that downsizing occurs \nbecause of other problems in a company.151 This assumption may be caused by a firm’s dimin-\nished corporate reputation when a major downsizing is announced.152\nThe loss of human capital is another potential problem of downsizing (see Figure 7.2). Losing \nemployees with many years of experience with the firm represents a major loss of knowledge. As \nnoted in Chapter 3, knowledge is vital to competitive success in the global economy. Research \nalso suggests that a loss of valuable human capital can spill over into dissatisfaction of custom-\ners.153 Thus, in general, downsizing may be of more tactical (or short-term) value than strategic \n(or long-term) value, meaning that firms should exercise caution when restructuring through \ndownsizing.\nCompared to downsizing and leveraged buyouts, downscoping generally leads to more positive \noutcomes in both the short and long term. Downscoping’s desirable long-term outcome of higher \nperformance is a product of reduced debt costs and the emphasis on strategic controls derived \nfrom concentrating on the firm’s core businesses. In so doing, the refocused firm should be able to \nincrease its ability to compete.154\nLBOs that involve taking over the whole firm have been hailed as a significant innovation in \nthe financial restructuring of firms. However, this type of restructuring can be complicated, espe-\ncially when cross-border transactions are involved.155 Also, they can involve negative trade-offs.156 \nFirst, the resulting large debt increases the firm’s financial risk, as is evidenced by the number of \ncompanies that filed for bankruptcy in the 1990s after executing a whole-firm LBO. Sometimes, \nthe intent of the owners to increase the efficiency of the acquired firm and then sell it within five \nto eight years creates a short-term and risk-averse managerial focus.157 As a result, these firms may \nfail to invest adequately in R&D or take other major actions designed to maintain or improve the \ncompany’s ability to compete successfully against rivals.158 Because buyouts more often result in \nsignificant debt, most LBOs have been completed in mature industries where stable cash flows are \nthe norm. Stable cash flows support the purchaser’s efforts to service the debt obligations assumed \nas a result of taking a firm private.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Through this strategy, firms seek to \ncreate value and outperform rivals.\n \n● A merger is a strategy through which two firms agree \nto integrate their operations on a relatively coequal \nbasis. An acquisition is a strategy through which a \nfirm buys most or all of a company’s stock with the \nintent of making the acquired firm a subsidiary busi-\nness within its portfolio. A takeover is a special type of \nacquisition where the target firm does not solicit the \nacquiring firm’s bid.\n \n● A horizontal acquisition is an acquisition of a com-\npany competing in the same industry as the acquiring \nfirm. A vertical acquisition refers to a firm acquiring a \nsupplier or distributor of one or more of its products. \nA related acquisition occurs when a firm acquires \nanother firm in a highly related industry.\n \n● Firms use acquisition strategies to:\n \n● increase market power\n \n● overcome entry barriers to new markets or regions\n \n● avoid the costs of developing new products and \nincrease the speed of new market entries\n \n● reduce the risk of entering a new business\n \n● become more diversified\n \n● reshape their competitive scope by developing a \ndifferent portfolio of businesses\n \n● enhance their learning as the foundation for devel-\noping new capabilities\n \n● Among the problems associated with using an acquisi-\ntion strategy are:\n \n● the difficulty of effectively integrating the firms \ninvolved\n \n● incorrectly evaluating the target firm’s value\n \n● creating debt loads that preclude adequate \nlong-term investments (e.g., R&D)\n \n● overestimating the potential for synergy\n \n● creating a firm that is too diversified\n \n● creating an internal environment in which manag-\ners devote increasing amounts of their time and \nenergy to analyzing and completing the acquisition\n \n● developing a combined firm that is too large, \nnecessitating extensive use of bureaucratic, rather \nthan strategic, controls\n \n● Effective acquisitions have the following characteristics:\n \n● the acquiring and target firms have complementary \nresources that are the foundation for developing \nnew capabilities\n \n● the acquisition is friendly, thereby facilitating \nintegration of the firm’s resources\n \n● the target firm is selected and purchased based \non completing a thorough due-diligence process\n \n● the acquiring and target firms have considerable \nslack in the form of cash or debt capacity\n \n● the newly formed firm maintains a low or moderate \nlevel of debt by selling off portions of the acquired \nfirm or some of the acquiring firm’s poorly perform-\ning units\n \n● the acquiring and acquired firms have experience \nin terms of adapting to change\n \n● R&D and innovation are emphasized in the \nnew firm\n \n● Restructuring is used to improve a firm’s perfor-\nmance by correcting for problems created by  \nineffective management. Restructuring by downsiz-\ning involves reducing the number of employees  \nand hierarchical levels in the firm. Although it \ncan lead to short-term cost reductions, the reduc-\ntions may be realized at the expense of long-term \nsuccess because of the loss of valuable human \nresources (and knowledge) and overall corporate \nreputation.\n \n● The goal of restructuring through downscoping is to \nreduce the firm’s level of diversification. Often, the \nfirm divests unrelated businesses to achieve this goal. \nEliminating unrelated businesses makes it easier for \nthe firm and its top-level managers to refocus on the \ncore businesses.\n \n● Through a leveraged buyout (an LBO), a firm is pur-\nchased so that it can become a private entity. LBOs \nusually are financed largely through debt, although \nlimited partners (institutional investors) are becom-\ning more prominent. General partners have a variety \nof strategies, and some emphasize equity versus \ndebt when minority partners have a longer time \nhorizon. Management buyouts (MBOs), employee \nbuyouts (EBOs), and whole-firm LBOs are the three \ntypes of LBOs. Because they provide clear manage-\nrial incentives, MBOs have been the most success-\nful of the three. Often, the intent of a buyout is to \nimprove efficiency and performance to the point \nwhere the firm can be sold successfully within five to \neight years.\n \n● Commonly, restructuring’s primary goal is gaining \nor reestablishing effective strategic control of  \nthe firm. Of the three restructuring strategies,  \ndownscoping is aligned most closely with estab-\nlishing and using strategic controls and usually \nimproves performance more on a comparative  \nbasis.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Why are merger and acquisition strategies popular in \nmany firms competing in the global economy?\n2. What reasons account for firms’ decisions to use acqui-\nsition strategies as a means to achieving strategic \ncompetitiveness?\n3. What are the seven primary problems that affect a \nfirm’s efforts to successfully use an acquisition strategy?\n4. What are the attributes associated with a successful \nacquisition strategy?\n5. What is a restructuring strategy, and what are its com-\nmon forms?\n6. What are the short- and long-term outcomes associ-\nated with the different restructuring strategies?\nMini-Case\nTwo Suitors Seek to Acquire Low-Budget Spirit Airlines\nTwo trends have predominated the airline industry over the \npast few decades. The first is industry consolidation. To name \njust a few of the larger mergers since 2010: United Airlines \nacquired Continental Airlines in 2010 and ExpressJet Airlines \nin 2019; Southwest Airlines acquired AirTran Airways in 2010; \nAlaska Airlines acquired Virgin America in 2016; American \nAirlines merged with US Airways in 2013; British Airways \nmerged with Iberia in 2011 to form International Airlines \nGroup (IAG); IAG was in the process of acquiring Air Europa \nin 2022, with the full acquisition expected to be completed in \n2023. The most commonly cited reasons for these mergers \nand acquisitions are to enhance efficiency through econo-\nmies of scale and to provide customers with more routes and \ndestinations.\nThe other important trend is the increasing popularity \nof low-priced, “no frills” airlines. In 2022, the United States \nhad Spirit Airlines, Frontier Airlines, and JetBlue Airlines, \nalthough JetBlue offers more extras for customers than the \nother two. Europe had Ryanair, EasyJet, and Wizz Air, among \nothers. In Asia, Scoot Airlines and Indigo competed in a \ncrowded field. Fastjet and FlySafair were among the many \nlow-priced carriers in Africa. These types of airlines con-\ntinue to proliferate. In 2017, IAG created a new airline called \nLEVEL, offering low-cost pricing on long flights.\nThese two trends came together in the merger of Spirit \nAirlines with, well, somebody. Frontier Airlines was the first \nsuitor, with a deal valued at $2.9 billion. Spirit took the deal. \nThen JetBlue offered $3.6 billion to take over the company. \nBoth companies viewed Spirit as important to growing and \nbecoming more competitive with the major airlines. Either \ndeal would make the merged airline the fifth largest in the \nU.S. market. “Both companies have accused the other of act-\ning in bad faith.”\nSpirit’s board turned down the offer from JetBlue: “Spirit’s \nboard said it believed there was too much risk that regulators \nwould bar a merger with JetBlue, even after JetBlue pledged \nto shed assets to win regulatory approval and to pay a $200 \nmillion breakup fee if it was unable to complete the proposed \nacquisition for anti-trust reasons.” Nonetheless, the board \nviewed the JetBlue offer as too risky for shareholders.\nWhen Spirit turned the offer down in favor of maintain-\ning its deal with Frontier, JetBlue launched a hostile takeover \nattempt. “JetBlue is appealing directly to shareholders by \nlaunching a tender offer for their shares, in hopes of pressur-\ning Spirit’s management to re-engage in negotiations.” The \noffering price for the tender offer was $30 per share com-\npared to its initial offer of $33 per share; however, JetBlue said \nit would be willing to negotiate if Spirit provided some infor-\nmation needed for due diligence. The lower price was because \nof what JetBlue said was a lack of cooperation from Spirit in \nproviding necessary information. JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes \nsaid, “If the Spirit shareholders vote against the transaction \nwith Frontier and compel the Spirit board to negotiate with \nus in good faith, we will work towards a consensual transac-\ntion at $33 per share, subject to receiving the information to \nsupport it.”\nJetBlue began meeting with Spirit shareholders to con-\nvince them that the JetBlue deal was in their best interests. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

If it appears that a deal is \nattractive to shareholders, reluctant boards will often change \ntheir positions and negotiate a deal. In this case, JetBlue won \nout in a deal valued at $3.8 billion.\nSources: A.

Of the reasons for acquisitions discussed in the \nchapter, which reasons are the primary drivers of the \nmerger of Spirt Airlines with one of the two suitors? \nBeyond the two reasons mentioned in the case, are \nthere others which would seem to apply to this  \nsituation?\n2. If a company successfully completes a hostile take-\nover, is it more or less likely to be successful com-\npared to a friendly merger? Why do you believe this is \nthe case?\n3. Is it ethical to entertain or even accept another deal \nwhen a board of directors already has an agreement \nwith a previous company? Consider this question from \nthe perspective of shareholders of the target company \n(e.g., Spirit), the shareholders of the suitor (JetBlue), \nand the shareholders of the firm with whom the firm \nalready has an agreement (e.g., Frontier).\n4.

The Model S was revered by critics \nand customers alike as safe, comfortable, and very fast, with a record time of 2.28 \nseconds to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour. The Model X, a sport utility vehicle, \nfollowed. Then, in 2016, the Model 3 was introduced as a lower-priced, high-volume \nelectric vehicle. The company didn’t quit there, but continued to design Tesla Semi, \nbilled as “the most comfortable truck ever,” a midsize sport utility vehicle called Model \nY, and Cybertruck. True to its mission, Tesla also produces solar roofs and solar panels.\nTesla has factories in several places, but in 2021, most of its automobiles were \nmanufactured California (U.S.) and Shanghai (China). Tesla was serving the European \nmarket primarily from Shanghai. That all changed in 2022 as Tesla began delivering \ncars from a new plant \njust outside Berlin \nin eastern Germany. \nElon Musk, Tesla’s \nCEO, said on the day \nthe first cars were \ndelivered to their \nnew owners that “the \nfactory would create \na foundation for both \nelectric vehicles and \nthe batteries that \ncould store energy \nfrom wind and the \nsun.” He considers the \nopening of this plant \na “big step in the \nfight against global \nwarming.” Musk also \ncited the huge cost \nsavings associated \nwith producing auto-\nmobiles in the continent in which they are sold.\nTesla’s European plant is a direct threat to Volkswagen, currently the market leader \nin the European electric vehicle market. As of 2021, Tesla was in third place in Europe, \nbarely behind second-place Stellantis (formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and \nthe French PSA Group). However, Volkswagen announced that it was going to invest \n2 billion euros in a new electric vehicle plant near its German headquarters. Con-\nstruction begins in 2023, with the first cars rolling off the production line in 2026. \nVolkswagen says it wants to use technology in the new factory to reduce the number \nof hours it takes to make a car to 10 from its current 30 hours. Volkswagen is also \nconsidering making an electric truck in the United States. \nOther competitors are also making bold moves to challenge Tesla’s strong market \nposition in electrical vehicles. General Motors is restarting production of its Chevy \nBolt and is only shipping Hummer electric pickup trucks to dealers after customers \norder them online, a practice pioneered by Tesla for selling electric vehicles. Ford is \nnow selling about as many of its all-electric Mustangs as its gas-powered versions; it \nis also considering a deliver-after-order system. Rivian Automotive, a California-based \nelectric vehicle manufacturer (currently pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles), \nraised almost $12 billion in new capital as the company went public in late 2021, as \ninvestors felt confident that the company could rival Tesla.\nThe most limiting feature of electric vehicles is range, and Tesla is definitely get-\nting some competition in this area. Tesla’s longest range for the Model S is 405 miles. \nIn 2021, Lucid Group released the 2022 Lucid Air, with an expected range of up to \n520 miles. The secret is higher voltage.

Being able to effectively compete in \ncountries and regions outside a firm’s domestic market is increasingly important to firms of all \ntypes. One reason is that the effects of globalization continue to reduce the number of industrial \nand consumer markets in which only domestic firms can compete successfully. In place of what \nhistorically were relatively stable and predictable domestic markets, firms across the globe find \nthey are now competing in globally oriented industries—industries in which firms must compete \nin all or most world markets where a consumer or commercial good or service is sold to be com-\npetitive.1 However, unlike domestic markets, global markets are relatively unstable and much less \npredictable.2\nAn international strategy is a strategy through which a firm produces and/or sells its goods \nand/or services outside the country in which its headquarters office is located. The market in which \nthe headquarters office is located is referred to as the “home” market. A multinational corporation \n(MNC) can be defined as “a business entity with one or more foreign affiliates in which the parent \ncompany holds at least a 10 percent ownership stake.”3\nIn some instances, firms using an international strategy become quite diversified geographi-\ncally as they manufacture their products and compete in numerous countries or regions outside \ntheir domestic market.4 In other cases, firms engage in no international diversification because \nthey focus on their home market. Among the Fortune 500 firms, approximately 35 percent have no \nphysical operations outside their home countries (although their products may still be exported), \n25 percent operate in less than 25 locations in other countries, and about 5 percent have more than \n500 international locations across a variety of countries.5 \nAs a firm enters new markets outside its home country or increases the number of international \nmarkets in which it operates, it is pursuing international diversification; this is like the concept \nof diversification we discussed in Chapters 6 and 7, only with an international orientation. An  \ninternational diversification strategy is a strategy through which a firm expands the production \nand/or sales of its goods and/or services across the borders of global regions and countries into a \npotentially large number of geographic locations or markets. In other words, an international diver-\nsification strategy describes the means through which a firm develops an international strategy. The \nresources a firm possesses provide limits to a firm’s international diversification and provide a basis \nfor achieving competitive advantage in the countries in which the firm expands.6 As the firm grows \ninternationally, both its organization and the resources it possesses change. Managers who are \nastute at managing this process can enhance firm performance and achieve above-average returns.7\nThe purpose of this chapter is to discuss how international strategies can be a source of strate-\ngic competitiveness for firms competing in global markets. To do this, we examine several topics. \nAfter reviewing some of the major trends that are either encouraging or discouraging international \ndiversification, we describe factors firms should consider when selecting a country to enter. We \nthen turn our attention to the international strategies available to firms. Specifically, we exam-\nine both international corporate-level and business-level strategies. The five modes of entry firms \ncan use to enter international markets for implementing their international strategies are then \nLearning Objective\n8-1 Discuss global \nenvironmental trends \nand firm incentives \naffecting firms’ decisions \nto pursue international \nstrategies.\nAn international \ndiversification strategy is \na strategy through which a \nfirm expands the production \nand/or sales of its goods \nand/or services across the \nborders of global regions and \ncountries into a potentially \nlarge number of geographic \nlocations or markets.\nAn international strategy \nis a strategy through which \na firm produces and/or sells \nits goods and/or services \noutside the country in which \nits headquarters office is \nlocated.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Often \ndemand for the product then develops in other countries, causing a firm to export products from \nits domestic operations to fulfil demand. Continuing increases in demand can subsequently justify \na firm’s decision to establish or expand operations outside of its home country, as illustrated in the \nOpening Case on Tesla. \nIn Chapter 1, we discussed the global economy and the increasing economic interdepen-\ndence of countries and their organizations. We also introduced the idea of global supply chains \nthat span multiple countries with the purpose of supplying goods and services.9 In Chapter 2, \nwe discussed several areas of the global segment of a firm’s external environment to include \nin a strategic analysis. In this section and the one that follows, we will build on the informa-\ntion found in those chapters to explain why a firm may want to pursue or increase its level of \ninternational diversification and the risks and problems that often accompany such a decision \n(see Figure 8.1).\n8-1b Global Trends\nIn Chapter 1, we explained that a global value chain is a process through which a firm receives raw \nmaterials and supplies from a firm that has the best products available (considering quality and \nprice)—regardless of where in the world they are located—adds value through combining and \naltering these resources, and sells them to another firm or the ultimate consumer of the prod-\nuct, wherever they are located.10 It is a set of interrelated activities that involve companies from \nGlobal Trends and\nFirm Incentives\nDifficulties\nand Risks\nGlobal Trends\n•  Global value chains\n•  Regionalization\nIncreased Market Size\n•  More demand\n•  Enter developing\n   economies\n•  Economies of scale\nPolitical  & Legal Risks\n•  Resistance to\n   globalization\n•  Changing regulations\n•  Corruption\n•  Military conflict\n•  Nationalization of\n   invested assets\n•  Trade barriers\nEconomic Risks\n•  Insufficient protection of\n   intellectual property\n•  Lack of infrastructure\n•  Interconnectedness\n•  Security risks\n•  Currency exchange rates\n•  Inflation\nManagement Difficulties\n•  Complexity\n•  Coordination costs\n•  Cultural differences\n•  Governmental\n   differences\nLocation Advantages\n•  Acquisition of scarce\n   resources\n•  Efficiency\nLearning\n•  Information sharing\n•  New technologies\nDecision to Pursue\nNew or Increase\nExisting\nInternational\nDiversification\nFigure 8.1 Forces Encouraging and Discouraging International Expansion\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Global \nvalue chains are becoming increasingly popular. As a natural extension of coordinating a global \nvalue chain, a firm may decide that it would be advantageous to acquire a supplier or a customer \nto achieve some of the advantages associated with vertical integration, such as having more control \nover the production process or more information from which to make better decisions.11 Of course, \nincreasing digitalization and the information systems it supports make coordination of a global \nvalue chain a lot more manageable.12 \nRelated to increasing digitalization, many of the most important companies in the interna-\ntional economy operate digital platforms that enhance the ability to cross international borders.13 \nIn fact, researchers found that Chinese exporters that made use of the Alibaba.com business-to- \nbusiness (B2B) platform had a greater ability to contact foreign buyers, which led to higher export \nperformance.14\nIn addition to global value chains and digital platforms, regionalization is a global environmental \ntrend influencing a firm’s choice and use of international strategies. This trend is becoming prom-\ninent largely because where a firm chooses to compete can affect its strategic competitiveness.15 As \na result, the firm considering using international strategies must decide if it should enter individual \ncountry markets or if it would be better served by competing in one or more regional markets. \nRegionalization makes pursuit of an international diversification reasonable for a larger number \nof firms. A regional international diversification strategy allows a firm to marshal its resources \nto compete effectively rather than spreading their limited resources across multiple country- \nspecific international markets. In fact, there is research evidence to suggest that international firms \nthat diversify quickly into countries within a region have higher performance than firms that diver-\nsify quickly across regions.16\nAlso, regionalization often helps a firm better understand the cultures, legal and social norms, \nand other factors that are important for effective competition in those markets. For example, a \nfirm may focus on Asian markets only, rather than competing simultaneously in the Middle East, \nEurope, and Asia. Or a firm may choose a region of the world where markets share important simi-\nlarities, making coordination and sharing of resources easier. Firms commonly focus much of their \ninternational market entries on countries adjacent to their home country, which might be referred \nto as their home region.17\nCountries that develop trade agreements to increase the economic power of their regions may \npromote regional strategies. The European Union and South America’s Organization of American \nStates (OAS) are multi-country associations that developed trade agreements to promote the flow \nof trade across country boundaries within their respective regions.18 Many European firms acquire \nand integrate their businesses in Europe to better coordinate pan-European brands as the European \nUnion tries to create unity across the European markets. This process is likely to continue as new \ncountries are added to the agreement.\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), signed by the United States, Canada, \nand Mexico in 1993, facilitates free trade across country borders in North America. NAFTA loos-\nens restrictions on international strategies within this region and provides greater opportunity for \nregional international strategies.19 A revised agreement called the United States-Mexico-Canada \nAgreement (USMCA) in the United States and the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement \n(CUSMA) in Canada, was approved by all three countries in 2020.20 Many of the provisions are sim-\nilar to NAFTA; however, the agreement provides more protection for intellectual property, removes \nbarriers to storage of information in a country other than where it originated, and increases envi-\nronmental and worker regulations.\nMost firms enter regional markets sequentially, beginning in markets with which they are more \nfamiliar. They also introduce their largest and strongest lines of business into these markets first, \nfollowed by other product lines once the initial efforts are deemed successful. The additional prod-\nuct lines typically are introduced in the original investment location.21 However, research also sug-\ngests that the size of the market and industry characteristics can influence this decision.22 \nRegionalization is important to most multinational firms, even those competing in multiple \nregions across the globe. For example, most large multinational firms have organizational struc-\ntures that group operations within the same region (across countries) for managing and coordi-\nnation purposes. Managing businesses by regions helps multinational enterprises deal with the \ncomplexities and challenges of operating in multiple international markets. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Carrefour operates five \nmain grocery store formats—hypermarkets, super-\nmarkets, cash and carry, hypercash stores, and con-\nvenience stores. The firm also sells products online. \nCarrefour operates 12,225 stores in 30 countries.24 \nIn addition to expanding into developed econ-\nomies such as Europe or the United States, the \npotential for large increases in demand for goods \nand services from people in emerging markets such \nas China and India is another strong incentive for \nfirms to use an international strategy.25 According to \ndata from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the \nU.S., although about half of the sales from United \nStates, foreign affiliates come from Europe, Asian \nsales are increasing, and currently account for about 30 percent of sales.26 \nEven though India differs from Western countries in many respects, such as culture, politics, \nand the precepts of its economic system, it offers a huge potential market, and the Indian gov-\nernment has become more supportive of foreign direct investment.27 Differences among Chinese, \nIndian, and Western-style economies and cultures make the successful use of an international \nstrategy challenging. As such, firms seeking to meet customer demands in emerging markets \nmust learn how to manage an array of political and economic risks, which we discuss later in this \nchapter.28\nBy expanding the number of markets in which they compete, firms may be able to enjoy \neconomies of scale, particularly in manufacturing operations. More broadly, firms able to make \ncontinual process improvements enhance their ability to reduce costs while, hopefully, increas-\ning the value their products create for customers.29 For example, rivals Airbus SE and Boeing \nhave multiple manufacturing facilities and outsource some activities to firms located throughout \nthe world, partly for developing economies of scale as a source of being able to create value for \ncustomers. Economies of scale are also a critical component of Costco’s business model. Costco \nbuys goods in large quantities at low costs (because of its economies of scale), thus allowing the \nfirm to sell the goods to consumers at lower prices, passing on the savings provided by Costco’s \npurchases.30 \n8-1d Location Advantages\nGaining access to needed and potentially scarce resources is another reason that firms use an \ninternational strategy. Key supplies of raw material—especially minerals and energy—are critical \nto firms’ efforts in some industries to manufacture their products. Energy and mining companies \nhave access to the raw materials, through their worldwide operations, which they in turn sell to \nmanufacturers requiring those resources. Rio Tinto Group is a leading international mining cor-\nporation originally founded in Spain, but now with dual headquarters in London and Melbourne. \nOperating as a global organization, the firm has 49,000 employees and operates in 35 countries. \nRio Tinto uses its capabilities of technology and innovation (see first incentive noted above), explo-\nration, marketing, and operational processes to identify, extract, and market mineral resources \nthroughout the world.31 \nIn industries where labor costs account for a significant portion of a company’s expenses, firms \nmay choose to establish facilities in other countries to gain access to less expensive labor. Cloth-\ning and electronics manufacturers are examples of firms pursuing an international strategy for this \nreason.\nPaulSat/Shutterstock.com\nCarrefour opened its first hypermarket in France in 1960 and is now the \nsecond-largest retailer in the world.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This benefit of an international strategy accrues to the firm when \nits facilities in international locations provide easier access to lower energy and other natural \nresources, in addition to labor. Other location advantages include access to critical supplies and to \ncustomers. Once positioned in an attractive location, firms must manage their facilities effectively \nto gain the full benefit of a location advantage.32\nAs we will discuss in the next section, the influences of cultural and formal country institu-\ntions (e.g., laws and regulations) may affect location advantages and disadvantages. International \nbusiness transactions are easier for a firm to complete when there is a strong cultural match and \nsimilar country institutions with which the firm is involved while implementing its international \nstrategy.33 \n8-1e Learning\nOperating in multiple international markets also provides firms with new learning opportunities.34 \nKnowledge can be transferred from the headquarters of a multinational firm to its international \nsubsidiaries as well as across those subsidiaries and back to headquarters. The multinational firm’s \nlearning network expands through international diversification, and since each country provides \na different set of environmental and competitive conditions, significant learning can take place.35 \nIn fact, a multinational firm has the opportunity to conduct “trial and error” experiments within \nvarious countries, and then apply what is learned in those countries across business operations in \nother countries and regions of the world.36 Also, “unlearning” is important.37 For example, a multi-\nnational firm may believe it has mastered a particular production process, but then discovers that \none of its foreign subsidiaries does something even better, so it has to unlearn what it thought it \nknew so it can improve its own process.\nMultinational firms can also pursue joint research and development (R&D) activities to both \nseek out new discoveries and exploit those discoveries. In fact, research indicates that a balanced \nprogram of discovery of new knowledge and exploitation (application) of that knowledge enhances \nperformance in multinational firms.38 Increasing the firm’s R&D ability can contribute to its efforts \nto enhance innovation, which is critical to both short- and long-term success. However, research \nresults suggest that to take advantage of international R&D investments, firms need to have a strong \nR&D system already in place to absorb knowledge resulting from effective R&D activities.39 Also, \na multinational firm produces more innovation if it has R&D activities in a moderate number of \ninternational regions as compared to many regions (which would be hard to manage) or a single \nregion (which limits opportunities).40\nFirms may also be able to exploit core competencies in international markets through resource \nand knowledge sharing between units and network partners across country borders.41 By sharing \nresources and knowledge in this manner, firms can learn how to create synergy, which in turn can \nhelp each international business unit within the firm learn how to manufacture, sell, or deliver \nproducts or services more effectively. For example, research indicates that platform-based payment \nservices (i.e., mobile wallets) are more popular in developing countries like China and India than \nin Western countries.42 Consequently, firms that have business units in those countries can develop \ncore competencies in these sorts of payment systems and transfer those competencies to business \nunits in other countries.\nThe strength of the science base of the international markets in which a firm may compete \nis important to learning because scientific knowledge and human capital are needed to facilitate \nefforts to more effectively design, sell, or deliver products that create value for customers.43 This is \none of the reasons that Tesla decided to locate a new design center in Beijing.44 China was not only \nTesla’s second-largest market in 2021 (after the United States), but there is significant technical \nexpertise in China that the company can access to enhance the design of its automobiles.\nAlso, a firm that is engaged in knowledge activities with a high degree of overlap with industry \nrivals may internationalize their innovations in order to protect them.45 For example, a firm may be \nconcerned that if they do not introduce a product innovation into a particular country, a rival firm \nin that country may develop a similar product and beat them to market in that country, making it \nmore difficult to enter the market at a later time.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This success awakened \nU.S. managers to the importance of international competition and the fact that many markets were \nrapidly becoming globalized. In the twenty-first century, Brazil, India, and China represent major \ninternational market opportunities for firms from many countries, including the United States, \nCanada, Japan, Korea, and members of the European Union. In addition, emerging economies \nsuch as Mexico, Indonesia, Lithuania, United Arab Emirates, and Malaysia have shown rapid \ngrowth, Internet penetration, and improving rule of law.46 However, even if foreign markets seem \nattractive, there are legitimate concerns for firms considering entering these markets. Mentioned \nfirst in Chapter 1 is the liability of foreignness, a set of costs associated with various issues firms face \nwhen entering foreign markets, including unfamiliar operating environments; economic, admin-\nistrative, and cultural differences from their home institutional environments; and the challenges \nof coordination over distances.47 \nWalt Disney Company’s experience while opening theme parks in foreign countries demon-\nstrates the liability of foreignness. For example, Disney suffered “lawsuits in France, at Disneyland \nParis, because of the lack of fit between its transferred personnel policies and the French employees \ncharged to enact them.”48 Disney executives learned from this experience and from building the \nfirm’s theme park in Hong Kong, and the company “went out of its way to tailor the park to local \ntastes.”49 The following sections explain in more depth many of the risks and problems firms face \nin their international expansions due to the liability of foreignness (see right side of Figure 8.1).\n8-2a Political and Legal Risks\nPolitical risks come from the probability that the operations of multinational firms will be disrupted \nby political forces or political events that occur within their home countries or in one or more of \ntheir host countries.50 Closely related to political risks, legal risks stem from inadequate legal legis-\nlation or enforcement to protect a firms operations or assets.51 For example, legal risks are higher \nwhen a country has inadequate legislation regarding contracts or if it is hard to enforce contracts \nwhen breaches occur.52 Often a country that is less politically stable would also have a less well- \nestablished (and enforced) legal system.\nA global movement against globalization, especially in advanced economies, has a large impact \non the risk factors described in this section.53 “There is mounting evidence of a widespread popular \nbacklash against globalization in advanced economies, which can hurt multinational companies’ \n(MNCs) interests.”54 Both growing ideological divisions and populism in societies are driving this \ntrend, called deglobalization.55 In fact, consumers sometimes hold lower perceptions of products \nproduced in a country other than their own simply because they have hostile feelings about that \ncountry.56 For example, in 2012, there was an anti-Japanese social movement in China that made it \ndifficult for Japanese companies to sell products there.57 Anti-globalization forces can also prevent \nthe transfer of technological knowledge across international borders and restrict the free move-\nment of engineers and scientists.58 The risks of interconnectedness in global supply chains, dis-\ncussed in Chapter 1, are also helping to drive the deglobalization movement.\nPossible disruptions to a firm’s operations when seeking to implement its international strategy \ncreate numerous problems, including uncertainty created by government regulation; the existence \nof many, possibly conflicting, legal authorities or corruption; and the potential nationalization of \nprivate assets (e.g., when a government takes control of those assets).59 Firms investing in other \ncountries, when implementing their international strategies, may have concerns about the stability \nof the national government and the effects of unrest and government instability on their invest-\nments or assets.60 In fact, government stability and political risk have been found to be related to the \namount of a foreign direct investment coming into a country.61 Research also suggests that political \nrisk in one country often spreads to others, as in the Arab Spring revolutions among many Middle \nEastern countries.62 \nRussia provides a noteworthy example of a country with a high level of political and legal insta-\nbility in the years following the collapse of the Iron Curtain. To regain more central control and \nLearning Objective\n8-2 Explain the political, \nlegal, and economic \nrisks that discourage \nfirms from pursuing \ninternational strategies. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The initial institutional instability, followed by the actions \nof the central government, caused some firms to delay or avoid significant foreign direct invest-\nment in Russia. The riskiness of the situation worsened when Russia took the Crimean Peninsula \nfrom Ukraine. These were all strong signals to firms considering international diversification into \nRussia; however, the enormity of the market and the thirst of the Russian people for Western prod-\nucts led many firms to make huge investments in the country.\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, McDonalds, Volkswagen, Toyota, Goldman Sachs, Apple, and \nmany other companies ceased their operations in Russia.63 In response, Russian prosecutors issued \nwarnings to Western companies with operations in Russia, “threatening to arrest corporate lead-\ners there who criticize the government or to seize assets of companies that withdraw from the \ncountry, according to people familiar with the matter.”64 Shortly thereafter, “Moscow claimed that \nalmost 800 commercial aircraft have already been re-registered from Bermuda and Ireland into its \nown aeronautical records—implying it has appropriated them—in response to the European Union \nrequiring lessors to terminate contracts with Russian airlines by March 28.”65 \nAs a more subtle example of how political and legal risk can influence the success of interna-\ntional diversification, we can look at the potential effect of changing trade barriers (i.e., tariffs) on \nrisk for an industry such as the global delivery business. This service industry has been booming \nin the last few years, primarily because of the significant increase in online sales. However, global \ndelivery companies also face some unusual economic risks and uncertainties due to changes in \ntariffs and restrictions on international trade. For example, in 2018, the U.S. government imple-\nmented tariffs on specific goods imported from European countries, Canada, Mexico, and China. \nIn response, the European Union, Canada, China, and Mexico all instituted tariffs on specific \ngoods imported into their countries from the United States. If a major trade war breaks out, the \ngross domestic product (GDP) of each country is likely to decline.66 In other words, no country is \nlikely to come out of a trade war as a winner (based on the outcomes of past trade wars). If econo-\nmies decline, the demand for delivery services will also decline.\nTo deal with these concerns, firms should conduct a political and legal risk analysis of the coun-\ntries or regions they may enter. Through this sort of analysis, the firm examines potential sources \nand factors of noncommercial disruptions of their foreign investments and the operations flowing \nfrom them.67 \n8-2b Economic Risks\nEconomic risks include fundamental weaknesses in a country or region’s economy with the potential \nto cause adverse effects on firms’ efforts to successfully implement their international strategies.68 \nAs illustrated in the example of Russian instability, political risks and economic risks are interde-\npendent. That is, a stable political system is needed to sustain a stable and healthy economic system.\nInsufficient protection of intellectual property is a major economic challenge in countries that \ndo not have and enforce such legislation. If firms cannot protect their intellectual property, they \nare highly unlikely to use a means of entering a foreign market that involves significant and direct \ninvestments. Therefore, countries need to create, sustain, and enforce strong intellectual prop-\nerty rights to attract foreign direct investment.69 The revised version of NAFTA—the USMCA—is \nintended to address this issue. Again, we see the interconnectedness of political risk and economic \nrisk—the USMCA is a politically derived document. \nIn emerging economies, another significant economic risk is the lack of availability of import-\nant infrastructure to allow companies to conduct their business efficiently. For example, miners \nneed sufficient electrical power in national grids to meet their power usage requirements. Often, \ninefficient, state-owned electric power producers are forced to run intermittent blackouts, which \nis devastating for continuous process manufacturing and refining such as found in the mining \nindustry. South Africa used to have a reliable electrical power grid. However, the state-owned elec-\ntrical utility, Eskom Holdings Ltd., neglected to build new power plants and sufficiently maintain \ncurrent operating generating plants. As such, intermittent power outages have occurred, lasting up \nto 12 hours, resulting in significant productivity decreases in the mining industry, which produces \n60 percent of South Africa’s exports. As this example suggests, infrastructure can be a significant \neconomic risk in emerging or partially developed economies such as South Africa.70\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.\n\nChapter 8: International Strategy\n199\nThe interconnectedness of operations across international borders can also cause significant \nproblems for multinational firms.71 Previously, we discussed global value chains as a benefit of \ninternationalization; however, they also increase risk because something that happens in another \ncountry in which a firm operates can have a large impact on an entire value chain. For this reason, \nVolkswagen is rethinking globalization and changing its approach to manufacturing. The company \nis pursuing “strategies to shore up access to components and raw materials and shorted supply \nchains to make its regional businesses less dependent on far away suppliers, according to senior \nexecutives at the company.”72\nAnother economic risk is the perceived security risk of a foreign firm acquiring companies \nthat have rare natural resources or may be considered strategic regarding intellectual property. \nFor instance, many Chinese firms have been buying natural resource firms in Australia and Latin \nAmerica, as well as manufacturing assets in the United States. This has made the governments \nwhere the acquired firms are located concerned about such strategic assets falling under the control \nof state-owned Chinese firms.73 Terrorism is also a security risk, and it can lead a company to resist \nentering a country. For example, terrorism has had a negative effect on foreign direct investment \n(FDI) into Pakistan.74 In addition, digitalization, despite its benefits, has brought risks of its own. \nThese risks come primarily from three sources: information security, digital interdependence, and \nregulatory complexity.75\nAs noted previously, the differences and fluctuations in the value of currencies is among the \nforemost economic risks of using an international strategy.76 This is especially true as the level of \nthe firm’s geographic diversification increases to the point where the firm is trading in many cur-\nrencies. The value of the dollar relative to other currencies can affect the value of the international \nassets and earnings of U.S. firms. For example, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar can reduce \nthe value of U.S. multinational firms’ international assets and earnings in other countries.\nFurthermore, the value of different currencies can, at times, dramatically affect a firm’s com-\npetitiveness in global markets because of its effect on the prices of goods manufactured in differ-\nent countries. An increase in the value of the dollar can harm U.S. firms’ exports to international \nmarkets because of the price differential of the products. Currency value can be affected by the \ninstitution of tariffs and trade wars, as experienced recently in the United States and China. Also, \nthe concerns about the tariffs implemented can affect the amount of foreign firm’s investment even \nin developed economies (e.g., Western European countries).77 Thus, government oversight and \ncontrol of economic and financial capital, as well as corporate governance rules in a country, affect \nnot only local economic activity, but also foreign investments in the country.78\n8-3 Common Management Problems  \nfor Multinational Firms\nPursuing an international diversification strategy typically leads to growth in a firm’s size and the \ncomplexity of its operations. In turn, larger size and greater operational complexity make a firm \nmore difficult to manage.79 In general, it becomes increasingly difficult to effectively implement, \nmanage, and control a firm’s international operations with increases in geographic diversity.80 \nConsider the coordination costs associated with managing activities across a wide range of coun-\ntries, as opposed to managing those same activities within a single country. Consequently, for an \ninternational diversification strategy to increase the performance of the multinational firm overall, \nthe benefits discussed in the last section must outweigh the additional coordination costs.\nDifferent cultures across countries in which a firm competes can also create management \ndifficulties.81 For example, researchers found that workplace flexibility is much more important \nto employees of multinationals who are working in the United States compared to those working \nin China.82 Cultural factors can be strong barriers to the transfer of a firm’s core competencies \nfrom one market to another.83 Consequently, it is important for managers to work on integrating \nthe social aspects of their business units across countries so that people will be willing to share \nknowledge.84\nDifferences in culture also relate to the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) \nand sustainability in different countries.85 The citizens of some countries are very environmentally \nconscious, which results also in government legislation that is strict regarding things like carbon \nLearning Objective\n8-3 Describe the \ncommon management \nproblems multinational \nfirms experience.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

There also tends to be a lot of variation across countries \nconcerning factors associated with human rights (i.e., child labor, decent working conditions, free-\ndom). These sorts of differences make management difficult. For example, firms are often held \naccountable not only for their own local operations, but for the business practices of foreign suppli-\ners with whom they do business.86 Such accountability means that managers in the home country \nmust be aware of what their suppliers are doing, and aware of differences across countries concern-\ning what is considered acceptable business practice.\nThe relationships between the firm using an international strategy and the governments in the \ncountries in which the firm is competing can also create management difficulties because differ-\nences in host countries’ governmental policies and practices can be substantial, creating a need for \nthe focal firm to learn how to manage what can be a large set of different enforcement policies and \npractices.87 Also, sometimes legislation is passed that regulates how a nation’s firms must conduct \nbusiness in host countries. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, enacted by the U.S. \nCongress in 1977, prohibits bribery and requires companies to maintain accurate records of trans-\nactions when they are operating in other countries.88 U.S. executives have often complained that \nthis legislation puts U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage when operating in a country in \nwhich bribery is the norm.\nAs a result of these management problems, multinationals often locate operations in friendly \ncountries that are geographically close and have cultures and government systems more like \nwhat is found in their home country (e.g., regionalization). In that case, the firm is likely to \nencounter fewer trade barriers, the laws and customs are better understood, and the product \nis easier to adapt to local markets.89 For example, U.S. firms may find it less difficult to expand \ntheir operations into Mexico, Canada, and Western European countries than into Asian coun-\ntries. The next section goes into greater detail regarding how to select a country for international \ndiversification.\n8-4 Considerations for International Entry \nOnce a firm has decided to pursue an international diversification strategy or increase the geo-\ngraphic diversity of its current strategy through entering new countries, the next important deci-\nsion is the selection of new countries to enter (see Figure 8.2). Variations in the political, legal, \neconomic, social, and competitive environments make each country unique, so selecting the right \ncountries for entry is a challenging task.90 The Strategic Focus describes Israel as a potential coun-\ntry in which to do business. Israel is unique in that its lack of abundance of natural resources has \nbeen more than made up for by its culture and its highly trained and motivated workforce.\nLearning Objective\n8-4 Explain what a firm \nshould consider when \ndeciding whether to \nenter an international \nmarket.\nFactors Influencing\nDecision to Expand\nInternationally\nSelect Countries\nor Region\nto Enter\nSelect Corporate- and\nBusiness-level\nInternational Strategies\nSelect Mode of\nEntry for Countries\nor Regions\nDesired\nCompetitiveness\nOutcomes\n•  Global trends\n•  Increased market size\n•  Location advantages\n•  Learning\n•  Political/legal risks\n•  Economic risks\n•  Management\n   difficulties\n•  Exporting\n•  Licensing or\n   franchising\n•  Strategic\n   alliances and\n   joint ventures\n•  Acquisitions\n•  New, wholly\n   owned subsidiary\n   (greenfield\n   venture)\nInternational corporate-\nlevel strategy\n•  Multidomestic\n   strategy\n•  Global strategy\n•  Transnational strategy\nInternational business-\nlevel strategy\n•  Cost leadership\n•  Differentiation\n•  Focus\n•  Integrated cost\n   leadership/\n   differentiation\nFour primary\ndeterminants of\nattractiveness\n•  Factors of\n   production\n•  Demand conditions\n•  Related and\n   supporting\n   industries\n•  Firm strategy,\n   structure, and\n   rivalry\nPolitical, legal, and\neconomic systems\nCulture\nPolitical, legal, or\neconomic issues\nManagement\ndifficulties\n•  Improved\n   performance\n•  Enhanced\n   innovation\nPursue New or\nIncrease Existing\nInternational\nDiversification\nFigure 8.2 Opportunities and Outcomes of International Strategy \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The General \nAssembly of the United Nations accepted Israel as a nation in 1947. \nHowever, due to internal conflict and resistance on the part of the \nBritish to withdraw from this occupied territory, it took another year \nfor this nation to finally become a reality. After years of intense fight-\ning to gain political independence, Israel had very few resources with \nwhich to build an economy. Unlike its close neighbors, Israel doesn’t \nhave vast reserves of oil. Only recently has Israel produced meaningful \namounts of oil from wells dug into the ocean floor. Water is scarce. \nMost of the country is desert and the Sea of Galilee, the only notewor-\nthy body of fresh water in Israel, eventually began to dry up.\nSeveral times since its creation, the modern state of Israel has had \nto defend itself against hostile neighbors. One of the most notewor-\nthy battles is known as the Six Day War, in which Israel foiled an attack \nby a coalition of Arab states including Jordan, Syria, and Egypt in just \nsix days in 1967. This was not the last of Israel’s military struggles. Its \nenemies, both foreign and domestic, frequently fire missiles at Israel \nfrom outside the country or engage in terrorism within the country. \nIsrael is so used to these sorts of attacks that the country doesn’t “shut \ndown” when one occurs—people continue to go to work, children go \nto school, and businesses stay open.\nGiven all these hardships, and the lack of natural resources, Israel’s \nbusiness success is nothing short of miraculous. The country’s sci-\nentists have made numerous important contributions to physics, \nchemistry, optics, medicine, economics, biotechnology, and com-\nputer science. One of the most important innovations, at least for \nIsrael with its limited water, is drip irrigation. Israel has also planted \nmillions of trees and gained competence with water desalinization \nto deal with its water shortage. Intel has a major research and devel-\nopment unit in Israel, as do many other high-tech firms. The Waze \napp was created there—so were cherry tomatoes and many other \npopular products.\nHow has Israel been able to thrive under such hostile conditions? \nPerhaps most importantly, Israelis of all genders are required to serve \nin the military when they turn 18, and men are on reserve status with \nthe military for many years after their active service. This service is vol-\nuntary for Arabs within the country, and some exceptions exist based \non religious grounds. Everyone else serves. This service has produced \ncompetitive advantages for Israel. First, military training includes tech-\nnical training, which means that Israelis are highly qualified to work \nin technical jobs when they are released from active service. Second, \nthe social network that is created as people serve in the military lasts \nthroughout their lifetimes. This social network makes it much easier \nto conduct business in Israel. In addition, Israel has made massive \ninvestments in education. Also, the country embraces a hard work-\ning, “can do,” innovative culture that fosters an entrepreneurial spirit. \nFrom a very early age, children are taught that they can overcome \nobstacles and be successful in life and in business. The hardships Israel \nexperiences have created a mind-set of finding creative solutions to \novercome problems.\nDespite all the military conflicts, the political system in Israel is \ndemocratic and stable. Because so many people have migrated to \nIsrael from such a wide variety of countries and cultures, the popula-\ntion is diverse, which may also partially account for the high level of \ninnovation in the country. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) con-\ntracted approximately 5 percent in 2020 due to restrictions related \nto COVID-19 but rebounded by over 5 percent in 2021. Israel’s strong \npharmaceuticals and information technology sectors, as well as the \ndiversity of the nation’s businesses, make Israel’s economy very resil-\nient to shocks like the pandemic.\nIsrael has continued to attract a lot of investment, especially in \nthe tech sector. In 2021, Israeli tech companies raised $25.6 billion in \nprivate investments, a new record. This included 773 deals, with 77 \nof these deals attracting more than $100 million in funding. Several \nof the largest deals were orchestrated by SoftBank, a Japanese mul-\ntinational conglomerate. There is no sign that the investment mar-\nket is calming down. In early 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported \nthat a United Arab Emirates sovereign-wealth fund had recently \ninvested approximately $100 million in venture capital into Israel’s \ntechnology sector. Also, Intel agreed to buy Israeli chip maker Tower \nSemiconductor for just under $6 billion as a part of its plan to make \nchips for other companies.\nSources: R. Jones & D.

As Porter put it, “How can we explain why Germany is the home base \nfor so many of the world’s leading makers of printing presses, luxury cars, and chemicals? Why is \nSwitzerland the home base for international leaders in pharmaceuticals, chocolate, and trading? \nWhy are leaders in heavy trucks and mining equipment based in Sweden? Why has America \nproduced the preeminent international competitors in personal computers, software, credit cards, \nand movies?”91 Porter’s findings fall into four broad categories: factors of production, demand \nconditions, related and supporting industries, and firm strategy, structure and rivalry. While global \nsupply chains, advanced digital technologies and communications, international joint ventures, \noutsourcing, and global platforms have leveled the competitive playing field a lot across coun-\ntries, the four determinants of national advantage are still highly relevant to help firms determine \nwhether a country is a good candidate for entry.\nFactors of production refer to the inputs necessary for a firm to compete in any industry.92 Labor, \nland, natural resources, capital, and infrastructure (transportation, delivery, and communication \nsystems) represent such inputs. There are basic factors (natural and labor resources) and advanced \nfactors (digital communication systems and a highly educated workforce). Other factors of produc-\ntion are generalized (supply of capital available through the country’s financial system and infra-\nstructure items such as highway systems) and specialized (skilled personnel in a specific industry, \nsuch as the workers in a port that specialize in handling bulk chemicals). Before entering a country \nfor the first time, a firm should assess the extent to which necessary resources are readily available.\nThe second factor, demand conditions, is characterized by the nature and size of customers’ \nneeds for the products the firm intends to produce. If a lot of customers are likely to purchase the \nproduct the entering firm creates, it will be able to develop scale-efficient facilities and enhance the \ncapabilities, and perhaps core competencies, required to use those facilities.93\nThe third factor in Porter’s model is related and supporting industries. For example, Italy is a \nleader in the production of high-quality shoes because a well-established leather-processing indus-\ntry provides the leather needed to construct shoes and related products. Auto parts suppliers are \na huge factor in the success of Japanese automakers, especially in Japan. Suppliers cluster around \nToyota’s factories, providing fast delivery times and an opportunity to work together with Toyota \nin ensuring the quality and attractiveness of its automobiles. A firm considering entering a coun-\ntry should carefully assess the strength of the industries from which it intends to acquire needed \nmaterials and technology.\nFirm strategy, structure, and rivalry make up the final of the four factors. The types of strat-\negy, structure, and rivalry among firms vary greatly from nation to nation. The excellent technical \ntraining system in Germany fosters a strong emphasis on continuous product and process improve-\nments. In the United States, competition among computer manufacturers and software producers \nin the San Francisco area (e.g., Silicon Valley) contributes to further development of these indus-\ntries.94 In general, more rivalry leads to products that are attractive to customers, which enhances \nthe competitiveness of firms in foreign markets. Nonetheless, if the rivalry in a particular industry \nwithin a country is particularly strong already, this could be a deterrent to entry because the enter-\ning company could have a hard time catching up to existing competitors. In this regard, Tesla’s \nstrategy in Germany is very interesting (see Opening Case). Tesla is entering an industry with very \nhigh rivalry among existing German auto manufacturers; however, Tesla is entering this market \nwith a high-end product with which it already has a distinctive competency (e.g., electric vehicles).\nNotice that the emphasis in this discussion is on manufacturing, which is consistent with  \nPorter’s original study. However, these four factors are still relevant for service industries—they can \nbe adjusted so that they are useful to determining whether a country is an attractive place to offer \nservices as well as products. Some of the factors of production are not as applicable, but the other \nfactors can be just as important to providing services as they are to manufacturing.\n8-4b Political, Legal, and Economic Systems\nThe success of all types of entries into new international markets, whether they are product or \nservice oriented, are also subject to the strength and stability of a country’s formal institutions, \nwhich include government regulatory bodies and the legal community.

The legal community is also an important determinant of the attractiveness \nof a country for business. To what extent can a firm protect itself against unlawful actions or seek \nredress if another firm or individual does something harmful? Is contract law well defined and \nupheld in the courts? \nAs is evident from our discussion of political, legal and economic risks earlier in this chapter, \nfirms should carefully examine these dimensions before entering a new country or region. Some \ncountries have a very stable political system. Others are a lot less stable. In addition to Russia, there  \nis also political instability in many countries in Central and South America, Asia, and Africa.  \nThese countries may offer huge market potential, but they also offer a level of risk that is not attrac-\ntive for many firms. Research indicates that firms that diversify into countries that have regulatory \nenvironments similar to countries in which they have already expanded are much more likely to \nsucceed.95\nBeyond these formal institutions, perhaps the most obvious factor to consider is the strength of \na country’s economy. Firms should evaluate factors such as growth in gross national product (basic \nand per capita), the rate of inflation, the average income and distribution of income of citizens (to \ndetermine buying power), and movement in exchange rates between the home country’s currency \nand the currency of the country under consideration. This latter subject is especially important if \nthe firm intends to extract income from the country (as opposed to reinvesting it). According to a \nvery broad-based survey of 20,000 citizens from four regions of the world, the most economically \nstable countries are Switzerland, Canada, Germany, Denmark, and Japan, in that order. Although it \nis the largest economy in the world, the United States ranked 15th.96\n8-4c \nCulture\nPreviously, we discussed how variations in culture across countries makes management more \ndifficult, and thus, increases the risk associated with international expansion. Here, we continue \nthis discussion by considering culture, and in particular the cultural differences between the home \ncountry and the host country, as a factor to consider before entering a country. Cultural distance is \nthe term used to describe differences in shared norms across cultures.97 Included are dimensions \nsuch as the extent to which people avoid risk, whether they are more individualistic or collectiv-\nist in the way they think and act, and whether they are more short-term or long-term oriented. \nBeyond these more formal designations are differences in what behavior is considered acceptable, \nattitudes about diversity and inclusion, religious differences, language differences, differences in \neducational levels, and many other factors. \nIf two countries are culturally distant, it is harder to transfer managers and employees from the \nhome country to the host country or the other way around. They may find it difficult to assimilate, \nand they may also experience differences in relating to, communicating with, or managing other \npeople in the business or in the neighborhood in which they live. Similarly, there is a high likeli-\nhood that communications from the home office will be misunderstood, or that company-wide \nprograms will be misapplied.98 Also, it is often difficult to sell products when cultural barriers exist \nunless a high level of autonomy is given to the host country managers as to how the product will be \ntailored and marketed.99 Research suggests that managers with a lot of international experience can \nhelp a firm overcome some of the negative effects from cultural distance.100 \nThese are all issues to examine before deciding whether to enter a country. They can also help a \nfirm decide how to enter a country—whether through building a manufacturing facility on its own, \nestablishing a strategic alliance with a firm already doing business in the country, or in some other \nway. Entry methods will be explored in more depth later in this chapter.\n8-5 International Corporate-Level Strategies\nManagers of a multinational firm must make decisions about the firm’s corporate-level interna-\ntional strategy and its business-level international strategy (see Figure 8.2). At the corporate level, \nmultidomestic, global, and transnational international strategies are considered. At the business \nlevel, firms select from among the generic strategies of cost leadership, differentiation, focused cost \nLearning Objective\n8-5 Describe the three \ninternational corporate-\nlevel strategies.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

To contribute to \nthe firm’s efforts to achieve strategic competitiveness in the form of improved performance and \nenhanced innovation, international strategies should be based on one or more of the firm’s core \ncompetencies.101  \n8-5a International Corporate-Level Strategies\nA firm’s international corporate-level strategy determines the amount of management indepen-\ndence business units in host countries are given. The headquarters unit guides strategy; however, \ncountry-level managers can have substantial strategic input depending on the type of international \ncorporate-level strategy the firm uses. The three international corporate-level strategies are shown \nin Figure 8.3; they vary in terms of two dimensions—the need for global integration and the need \nfor local responsiveness.102\nMultidomestic Strategy\nA multidomestic strategy is an international strategy in which most strategic and operating deci-\nsions are decentralized to the business units within individual countries or regions, allowing each \nunit the opportunity to tailor products to the local market.103 With this strategy, the firm’s need for \nlocal responsiveness is high while its need for global integration is low. Influencing these needs is \nthe firm’s belief that consumer needs and desires, industry conditions (e.g., the number and type \nof competitors), political and legal structures, and social norms vary significantly by country. Thus, \na multidomestic strategy focuses on competition within each country because market needs are \nthought to be segmented by country boundaries. To meet the specific needs and preferences of \nlocal customers, country or regional managers have the autonomy to customize the firm’s prod-\nucts. Therefore, these strategies should maximize a firm’s competitive response to the idiosyncratic \nrequirements of each market.104 \nThe use of multidomestic strategies can help a firm expand its local market share in host \ncountries because the firm focuses its attention on the local clientele’s needs. Nestlé, the Swiss \nfood and beverage company, owns more than 2,000 brands. “They sell in over 186 countries, each \nwith its selection of brands curated to match local preferences.”105 Because of this matching of \nbrand portfolios to the needs and tastes of individual markets, Nestlé is pursuing a multidomestic \nstrategy.\nNeed for Global Integration\nNeed for Local Responsiveness\nHigh\nLow\nMultidomestic\nstrategy\nHigh\nLow\nGlobal\nstrategy\nTransnational\nstrategy\nFigure 8.3 International Corporate-Level Strategies\nA multidomestic strategy \nis an international strategy in \nwhich strategic and operating \ndecisions are decentralized \nto the business units within \nindividual countries or \nregions, allowing each unit \nthe opportunity to tailor \nproducts to the local market.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.\n\nChapter 8: International Strategy\n205\nDespite the benefits, using a multidomestic strategy results in less knowledge sharing for the \ncorporation as a whole because of the differences across markets, decentralization, and the dif-\nferent international business-level strategies employed by local units.106 Moreover, multidomestic \nstrategies do not allow the development of economies of scale and thus can lead to higher costs.\nGlobal Strategy\nA global strategy is an international strategy in which a firm’s home office determines the strat-\negies that business units are to use in each country or region.107 This strategy is most appropriate \nwhen a firm has a high need for global integration and a low need for local responsiveness. These \nneeds indicate that, compared to a multidomestic strategy, a global strategy seeks greater levels of \nstandardization of products across country markets. \nThe firm using a global strategy seeks to develop economies of scale as it produces the same, or \nlargely the same, products for distribution to customers throughout the world. The assumption is \nthat these customers have similar needs and tastes. Consequently, a global strategy is most effective \nwhen the differences between markets and the customers the firm is serving are insignificant. The \nglobal strategy offers greater opportunities to take innovations developed in one market and apply \nthem in other markets.108 \nEfficient operations are required to successfully implement a global strategy. Increasing the \nefficiency of a firm’s international operations mandates resource sharing and greater coordination \nand cooperation across market boundaries. Centralized decision making as designed by headquar-\nters details how resources are to be shared and coordinated across markets. Research results suggest \nthat the outcomes a firm achieves by using a global strategy become more desirable when the strat-\negy is used in areas in which regional integration among countries is occurring.109\nAs illustrated in the Strategic Focus, IKEA has implemented the global strategy. IKEA uses \na standardized set of products worldwide and has centralized several of its activities, including \ndesign and packaging. Accordingly, it integrates and centralizes some support functions from the \nfirm’s value chain (see Chapter 3). This integration and centralization foster economies of scale \nbenefiting IKEA. Alternatively, IKEA is having to implement changes because of increasing dig-\nitalization and urbanization. As future growth may come largely from these types of sales, it has \nincreased its online sales and continues to invest in the technology needed. It also has developed \nsmaller and more specialized stores in the urban parts of cities, catering to new customers.\nBecause of increasing global competition and the need to simultaneously be cost efficient and \nproduce differentiated products, the number of firms using a hybrid strategy—a transnational  \ncorporate-level strategy—is increasing. \nTransnational Strategy\nA transnational strategy is an international strategy through which a firm seeks to balance global \nefficiency and local responsiveness.110 To overcome cultural barriers in the sale of products in the \nhost country, a firm can use marketing and product features to increase the perception among \nconsumers that their brand is local, or at least more local than global.111 However, realizing the \ntwin goals of global integration and local responsiveness is difficult because global integration \nrequires close global coordination while local responsiveness requires local flexibility. “Flexible  \ncoordination”—building a shared vision and individual commitment through an integrated net-\nwork—is required to implement the transnational strategy. Such integrated networks allow a firm \nto manage its connections with customers, suppliers, partners, and other parties efficiently.112 \nTransnational strategies are becoming increasingly necessary to successfully compete in inter-\nnational markets. Reasons for this include the continuing increases in the number of viable global \ncompetitors that challenge firms to reduce their costs. Simultaneously, the increasing sophistica-\ntion of markets with greater information flows, made possible largely by the diffusion of the Inter-\nnet and the desire for specialized products to meet consumers’ unique needs, pressures firms to \ndifferentiate their products in local markets. Differences in culture and institutional environments \nalso require firms to adapt their products and approaches to local environments.\nMondelēz International was created as a spin-off company from Kraft, which separated its \ndomestic grocery products to focus on its high-growth snack foods business. Mondelēz had over \n$28 billion in revenue in 2021 and about 70,000 employees; it has power brands (brands that are \nglobally known and respected) and local brands.113 Because it globally integrates its operations \nto standardize and maintain its power brands while simultaneously developing and marketing \nA transnational strategy \nis an international strategy \nthrough which the firm \nseeks to achieve both \nglobal efficiency and local \nresponsiveness.\nA global strategy is an \ninternational strategy in \nwhich a firm’s home office \ndetermines the strategies that \nbusiness units are to use in \neach country or region.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Much of its furniture is assembled at home by cus-\ntomers. As with most companies pursuing a global strategy, IKEA \nemphasizes global efficiencies. The company continues to grow, with \nstores in 60 countries and counting.\nOne approach that IKEA has used to increase efficiency is to \nreduce shipping weight by efficient packaging. Standardization of \nthe product offerings, efficient packaging, and the associated benefit \nof lower transportation costs are “at the heart of IKEA’s ability to stay \naffordable.” “Instead of changing products once they have hit shelves, \nIKEA is increasingly designing things with packaging and manufac-\nturing in mind from the start.” This also means that assembling IKEA \nproducts at home may be complicated; however, some behavioral \neconomists believe this is actually a part of why IKEA is successful. \nDubbed the IKEA Effect, “The basic idea is that after we devote effort \nto something, we have more positive feelings toward it; we become \nattached.”\nThe number of visitors to IKEA stores is no longer increasing, so \nthe firm is ramping up its focus on online shopping. IKEA is expand-\ning this strategy by increasing its “click-and-collect merchandising \napproach where people order online and pick up the merchandise \nat a physical location.” Also, because of increased urbanization, IKEA \nis developing smaller city-center stores with a lower range of prod-\nucts compared to its majority of suburban store locations. A store \nin Madrid offers only bedroom furnishings, while another one in \nStockholm specializes in kitchen furniture and fixtures. IKEA is also \nexperimenting with new store formats, “A renovation in China and \nnew opening in Austria are designed to make customers want to \nlinger, rather than pace toward the checkout.” In Shanghai, IKEA has \na store with a large space with comfortable seating where people \ncan congregate, as well as a restaurant that features sustainable food \npractices and a workshop where people can repair old items or build \nnew ones.\nAlthough IKEA is focused on efficiency, it also invests a significant \namount of time studying each new country it enters. It focuses on \nwhere a growing middle class is developing. Consequently, IKEA has \nentered China, India, and many South American countries. Even in \nthese countries, IKEA is focusing on flat packing, efficient transporta-\ntion, and customer assembly of its Swedish-styled furniture.\nOne of IKEA’s latest strategies to improve its image is to develop \na sounder approach to sustainability. Accordingly, its store roofs are \noutfitted with solar panels, and it operates wind turbines in many \ncountries, with the goal of eventually becoming energy independent. \nWith its multiple actions to enhance sustainability, IKEA expects to be \nperceived as a socially and environmentally responsible company. \nThese costs have reduced its operating income in the short term, yet \nthey should lower overall costs in the longer term.\nLike most companies, the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative \neffect on IKEA’s performance, which extended into 2021 because of \nglobal supply-chain difficulties. IKEA Group’s fiscal year sales in 2021 \nwere 25.6 billion euros, up slightly from 23.6 billion euros in fiscal year \n2020; however, net income declined over 17 percent during the same \nperiod, and “the biggest cause was the steep increase in transport \nand raw material prices in the second half of the year.” Although fran-\nchise fees and wholesale sales of IKEA products increased during the \nyear, the global transportation crisis made it very difficult for the com-\npany to keep its IKEA stores well stocked. \nSources: 2022, Inter IKEA Group Financial Summary, Delft, Netherlands, Inter IKEA Systems \nB.V.; T.

Many multinational firms may \nrequire this type of flexibility if they are to be strategically \ncompetitive, in part due to trends that change over time.\n8-5b International Business-Level \nStrategies\nA firm’s international business-level strategy is based, to some \ndegree, on its international corporate-level strategy. Some \ninternational corporate-level strategies give individual coun-\ntry units the authority to develop their own business-level \nstrategies, while others dictate the business-level strategies to \nstandardize the firm’s products and sharing of resources across countries.114 The former situation \ntypically goes along with a multidomestic corporate-level strategy, while the latter tends to occur \nwhen a multinational firm is pursuing a global corporate-level strategy. Consequently, it is possible \nfor a multinational firm to have multiple different business-level strategies operating within vari-\nous business units in particular countries. A multinational firm could have a business unit pursu-\ning cost leadership in one country, differentiation in another, focus in another, and an integrated \ncost leadership/differentiation strategy in all the rest of the countries.\nAs we know from the discussion of competitive dynamics in Chapter 5, firms do not select and \nthen use strategies in isolation of market realities. In the case of international strategies, conditions \nin a firm’s domestic market affect the degree to which the firm can build on capabilities and core \ncompetencies it has established to create capabilities and core competencies in business units in \ninternational markets. Of course, conditions in the host country are just as critical in determin-\ning a business-level strategy. Firms need to carefully examine competition in a host country and \ndetermine not only what the generic business-level strategy will be, but also what its competitive \ntactics will be. The four primary determinants of country attractiveness—as well as the political, \nlegal, economic, and cultural realities of the host country—help in determining which strategies \nand tactics to use.\n8-6 Choice of Entry Mode for an International \nMarket\nFive modes of entry into international markets are available to firms.115 We show these entry modes \nand their characteristics in Figure 8.4. Each means of market entry has its advantages and dis-\nadvantages, suggesting that the choice of entry mode can affect the degree of success the firm \nachieves by implementing an international strategy.116 Many firms competing in multiple markets \nmay use one or more or all five entry modes.117\n8-6a Exporting\nFor many firms, exporting is the initial mode of entry used.118 Exporting is an entry mode through \nwhich the firm sends products it produces in its domestic market to international markets. \nExporting is a popular entry mode choice for small businesses to initiate an international strategy.119 \nIn Chapter 1, we defined a global supply chain as a network of firms that spans multiple coun-\ntries with the purpose of supplying goods and services.120 Participation in global supply chains is a \nprimary source of exporting. For example, a firm in Malaysia may specialize in producing a special \ntype of textile that is particularly useful in manufacturing outdoor sporting equipment (i.e., tents, \nsleeping bags). The textile is exported to five different sporting equipment manufacturers in five \ndifferent countries. These firms export their finished sporting equipment to wholesalers and retail-\ners around the world. Global supply chains like these develop over time, as companies search for \nthe best and most economical materials regardless of where in the world they are located.\nBy exporting, firms avoid the expense of establishing operations in host countries in which they \nhave chosen to compete. However, they must still establish some means of marketing and distribut-\ning their products. Usually, contracts are formed with host-country firms to handle these activities. \nLearning Objective\n8-6 Identify and explain \nthe five modes firms use \nto enter international \nmarkets.\nMondalez International.PNG\nPictured above are many of the international brands that Mondelēz \nmanages globally while implementing the transnational strategy.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The exporting firm also loses some control over the way its \nproducts are marketed and distributed. Evidence suggests that, in general, using an international \ncost leadership strategy when exporting to developed countries has the most positive effect on firm \nperformance, while using an international differentiation strategy with larger scale when exporting \nto emerging economies leads to the greatest success. In either case, younger firms with a strong \nmanagement team and market orientation capabilities are more successful.121\nFirms export mostly to countries that are closest to their facilities because usually transporta-\ntion costs are lower and there is greater similarity between geographic neighbors. The Internet has \nalso made exporting easier and more effective.122 Firms of any size can use the Internet to access \ncritical information about foreign markets, examine a target market, research the competition, and \nfind lists of potential customers.\n8-6b Licensing or Franchising\nLicensing is an entry mode in which an agreement is formed that allows a foreign company to pur-\nchase the right to manufacture and sell a firm’s products within a host country’s market or a set of \nhost countries’ markets.123 The licensor is normally paid a royalty on each unit produced and sold. \nThe licensee takes the risks and makes the monetary investments in facilities for manufacturing, \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

First mentioned \nin Chapter 4 as a type of business model, franchising \nis a form of licensing “that grants a franchisee access \nto a franchisor’s proprietary business knowledge, pro-\ncesses, and trademarks, thus allowing the franchisee to \nsell a product or service under the franchisor’s business \nname.”124 Again, the franchisee takes most of the risks. \nAs a result, licensing and franchising are possibly the \nleast costly forms of international diversification. \nLicensing and franchising also have disadvantages. \nFor example, after the deal is set, the licensing or fran-\nchising firm typically has little control over selling and \ndistribution. Developing agreements that protect the \ninterests of both parties, while supporting the relation-\nship embedded within an agreement, helps prevent this \npotential disadvantage.125 In addition, licensing and \nfranchising provide the least potential returns because \nprofits are shared. Another disadvantage is that the \ninternational firm may learn the technology of the party \nwith whom it formed an agreement and then produce and sell a similar competitive product after \nthe licensing agreement expires. In a classic example, Komatsu first licensed much of its technology \nfrom International Harvester, Bucyrus-Erie, and Cummins Engine to compete against Caterpillar \nin the earthmoving equipment business. Komatsu then dropped these licenses and developed its \nown products using the technology it gained from the U.S. companies.126 Because of potential dis-\nadvantages, the parties to a licensing arrangement should finalize an agreement only after they are \nconvinced that both parties’ best interests are protected.\n8-6c \nStrategic Alliances\nIn a multinational context, a strategic alliance involves a firm collaborating with another company \nin a different setting to enter one or more international markets.127 The nature of the collaboration \ncan take many forms, including joint manufacturing, cooperative advertising and distribution, or \na research collaboration. First mentioned in Chapter 1, a joint venture is a special type of strategic \nalliance in which two or more firms create a legally independent company to share resources. \nStrategic alliances and joint ventures will be more formally defined and described in Chapter 9. \nFirms share the risks and the resources required to enter international markets when using stra-\ntegic alliances.128 Moreover, because partners bring their unique resources together for the purpose \nof working collaboratively, strategic alliances can facilitate developing new capabilities and possibly \ncore competencies that may contribute to the firm’s strategic competitiveness.129 Indeed, developing \nand learning how to use new capabilities and/or competencies (particularly those related to tech-\nnology) is often a key purpose for which firms use strategic alliances as an entry mode.130\nFrench-based Groupe Limagrain is one of the largest seed companies in the world. Organized \nas an international cooperative group, Limagrain specializes in field seeds, vegetable seeds, and \ncereal products. Part of Limagrain’s strategy calls for it to continue to enter and compete in addi-\ntional international markets. Limagrain is using strategic alliances as one type of entry mode. In \n2011, the firm formed a strategic alliance with the Brazilian seed company Sementes Guerra in \nBrazil, focused on corn. Limagrain also had an earlier, successful joint venture with KWS in the \nUnited States. This venture, called AgReliant Genetics, focused primarily on corn and soybeans, \nis the third-largest seed-company in the United States. More recently, in 2020, Limigrain created \nSeed Co West & Central Africa with its partner Seed Co (and African Seed Company) to distribute \nagricultural seed in Ghana.131\nNot all alliances formed to enter international markets are successful.132 International strategic \nalliances are especially difficult to manage. Incompatible partners, conflict between the partners, \nand a loss of trust are primary reasons for failure.133 Efforts to build trust are affected by at least \nfour fundamental issues: the initial condition of the relationship, the negotiation process to arrive \nat an agreement, partner interactions, and external events.134 Trust is also influenced by the country \ncultures involved and the relationships between the countries’ governments (e.g., degree of political \nAlexander Pohl/Shutterstock.com\nAfter learning the technology needed to create their own heavy-duty \nequipment from their licensors, Komatsu dropped their licensing \nagreements, leaving the licensors at a huge disadvantage.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

If \nthere is anticipation of a high level of conflict or lack of trust among partners in a strategic alliance, \nusing acquisitions to enter international markets may be a better option.136\n8-6d Acquisitions\nWhen a firm acquires another company to enter an international market, it has completed a \ncross-border acquisition. Specifically, a cross-border acquisition is an entry mode through which \na firm from one country acquires a stake in or purchases an entire firm located in another coun-\ntry.137 As free trade expands in global markets, firms throughout the world are completing a larger \nnumber of cross-border acquisitions. The ability of cross-border acquisitions to provide rapid \naccess to new markets is a key reason for their growth. In fact, of the five entry modes, acquisitions \noften are the quickest means for firms to enter international markets.138 When the deal is done, they \nare immediately operating in the host country.\nAlthough increasingly popular, acquisitions as an entry mode are not without costs, nor are \nthey easy to successfully complete and operate. Cross-border acquisitions have some of the disad-\nvantages of domestic acquisitions (see Chapter 7). For example, they often require a high level of \ndebt financing to complete, which carries an extra cost and also increases leverage in the acquiring \nfirm. \nHowever, in many ways, cross-border acquisitions are even more difficult than domestic acqui-\nsitions. Negotiations for cross-border acquisitions can be exceedingly complex and are generally \neven more complicated than are the negotiations associated with domestic acquisitions.139 Dealing \nwith the legal and regulatory requirements in the target firm’s country and obtaining appropriate \ninformation to negotiate an agreement are also frequent problems. Finally, the merging of the new \nfirm into the acquiring firm is often more complex than is the case with domestic acquisitions. The \nfirm completing the cross-border acquisition must deal not only with different corporate cultures, \nbut also with potentially different social cultures and practices.140 Research indicates that greater \ncultural distance between the countries in which the acquiring and acquired firms operate is asso-\nciated with less long-term value creation.141 Integrating the two firms after the acquisition is more \nchallenging because it is difficult to capture the potential synergy when integration is slowed or \nstymied because of cultural differences.142 \nTherefore, while cross-border acquisitions are popular as an entry mode primarily because they \nprovide rapid access to new markets, firms considering this option should be fully aware of the \ncosts and risks associated with using it.\n8-6e New Wholly Owned Subsidiary (Greenfield Venture)\nA greenfield venture is an entry mode through which a firm invests directly in another country \nor market by establishing a new wholly owned subsidiary. The process of creating a greenfield \nventure is often complex and potentially costly, but this entry mode affords maximum control to \nthe firm and has the greatest amount of potential to contribute to the firm’s strategic competitive-\nness as it implements international strategies. This potential is especially true for firms with strong \nintangible capabilities that might be leveraged through a greenfield venture.143 Moreover, having \nadditional control over its operations in a foreign market is especially advantageous when the firm \nhas proprietary technology.\nResearch also suggests that “wholly owned subsidiaries and expatriate staff are preferred” in \nservice industries where “close contacts with end customers” and “high levels of professional skills, \nspecialized know-how, and customization” are required.144 Other research suggests that, as invest-\nments, greenfield ventures are used more prominently when the firm’s business relies significantly \non the quality of its capital-intensive manufacturing facilities. In contrast, cross-border acquisi-\ntions are more likely to be used as an entry mode when a firm’s operations are human-capital \nintensive—for example, if a strong local union and high cultural distance (between the countries \ninvolved) would cause difficulty in transferring knowledge to a host nation through a greenfield \nventure.145\nThe risks associated with greenfield ventures are significant in that the costs of establishing a \nnew business operation in a new country or market can be substantial. To support the operations \nof a newly established operation in a foreign country, the firm may have to acquire knowledge and \nA greenfield venture is an \nentry mode through which \na firm invests directly in \nanother country or market \nby establishing a new wholly \nowned subsidiary.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This new knowledge and expertise often are neces-\nsary to facilitate the building of new facilities, establishing distribution networks, and learning \nhow to implement marketing strategies that can lead to competitive success in the new market.146 \nImportantly, while taking these actions, the firm seeks to maintain control over the technology, \nmarketing, and distribution of its products. Research also suggests that when the country risk is \nhigh, firms prefer to enter with joint ventures instead of greenfield investments. However, if firms \nhave previous experience in a country, they prefer to use a wholly owned greenfield venture rather \nthan a joint venture.147\n8-6f \nDynamics of Mode of Entry\nSeveral factors affect the firm’s choice about how to enter international markets. As mentioned \npreviously, market entry is often achieved initially through exporting, which requires no foreign \nmanufacturing expertise and investment only in distribution. Licensing and franchising tend \nto be lower cost strategies for entering a foreign country; however, control is limited. Strategic \nalliances are a popular entry mode because they allow a firm to connect with an experienced \npartner already in the market. Partly because of this ability, geographically diversifying firms \noften use alliances in uncertain situations, such as an emerging economy where there is signifi-\ncant risk (e.g., Venezuela). However, if intellectual property rights in the emerging economy are \nnot well protected, the number of firms in the industry is growing fast, and the need for global \nintegration is high, other entry modes such as a joint venture or a wholly owned subsidiary are pre-\nferred.148 In the final analysis though, all three modes—export, licensing/franchising, and strategic  \nalliances—can be effective means of initially entering new markets and for developing a presence \nin those markets.\nResearchers have found that multinational firms that use joint ventures to establish themselves \nin a foreign market often tend to abandon their local partners once they are established. As mul-\ntinationals “gain a competitive advantage from leveraging resources across borders, they will ini-\ntially benefit from sharing ownership with a local firm, to embed their foreign subsidiaries in the \nlocal environment and access local resources more effectively. Later, they will benefit from taking \nover the local partner’s equity share, to better embed their subsidiaries in the parent organization \nand transfer locally accessed resources to the MNC’s other locations.”149 Acquisitions and green-\nfield ventures can help firms establish a strong presence in an international market; however, both \nacquisitions and greenfield ventures are likely to come at later stages in the development of a firm’s \ninternational diversification strategy.\nThus, to enter a global market, a firm selects the entry mode that is best suited to its situation. \nIn some instances, the various options will be followed sequentially, beginning with export-\ning and eventually leading to greenfield ventures. In other cases, the firm may use several, but \nnot all, of the different entry modes, each in different markets. The decision regarding which \nentry mode to use is primarily a result of the industry’s competitive conditions; the country’s \nsituation and government policies; and the firm’s unique set of resources, capabilities, and core \ncompetencies.\n8-7 Desired Strategic Competitiveness \nOutcomes\nAs this chapter has demonstrated, a firm’s success in carrying out an international strategy depends \non many factors, including success in identifying the best countries or regions to enter, selection \nand implementation of appropriate corporate-level and business-level international strategies, \noptimal selection of a mode (or modes) of entry. In addition, many factors are not under a firm’s \ndirect control—such as global conflicts, supply chain disruptions, trade wars, natural disasters, or \nnew social movements—that can have a dramatic effect on the success of an international strategy. \nFirms should do what they can to mitigate anticipated risks through careful analysis of the busi-\nness, political, and cultural environments in which they operate or desire to operate. In the best \nsituations, and with skilled management, multinational firms can use an international strategy to \nachieve above-average returns and increase innovation.\nLearning Objective\n8-7 Discuss the desired \nstrategic competitiveness \noutcomes associated \nwith an international \ndiversification strategy.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The question is whether higher levels of international diversification enhance a firm’s \nperformance.\nEarly research demonstrated that as international diversification increases, a firm’s returns \ndecrease initially but then increase quickly as it learns how to manage the increased geographic \ndiversification it has created.152 Then, at some point, the degree of geographic and possibly prod-\nuct diversification the firm’s international strategies bring about causes the returns from using the \nstrategies to level off and eventually become negative.153 However, these early studies were repli-\ncated using a sample of 32,835 multinationals in 64 countries, and the researchers were unable to \nsupport previous findings. In fact, they found “no evidence of any within-firm effect of multina-\ntionality on performance.”154 Their results do not mean that international diversification is a bad \nidea. There was variation in their sample of firms, with some multinational firms enjoying high \nperformance and others experiencing low performance. The significance of the study is that it \npoints to the need to be careful in making decisions about where to expand and how to manage \nan internationally diversified portfolio of businesses. In general, it becomes increasingly difficult \nto effectively implement, manage, and control a firm’s international operations with increases in \ngeographic diversity.155\n8-7b Enhanced Innovation\nIn Chapter 1, we indicated that developing new technology is at the heart of strategic competitive-\nness. A nation’s competitiveness depends, in part, on the capacity of its industries to innovate.156 \nEventually, and inevitably, competitors outperform firms that fail to innovate. Therefore, the only \nway for individual nations and individual firms to sustain a competitive advantage is to upgrade it \ncontinually through innovation.157\nAn international diversification strategy creates the potential for firms to achieve greater \nreturns on their innovations (through larger or more numerous markets) while reducing the often- \nsubstantial risks of R&D investments. Additionally, international diversification may be necessary \nto generate the resources required to sustain a large-scale R&D operation. An environment of rapid \ntechnological obsolescence makes it difficult to invest in new technology and the capital-intensive \noperations necessary to compete in such an environment. Firms operating solely in domestic mar-\nkets may find such investments difficult because of the length of time required to recoup the orig-\ninal investment. However, diversifying into several international markets improves a firm’s ability \nto appropriate additional returns from innovation before domestic competitors can overcome the \ninitial competitive advantage created by the innovation.158 \nIn addition, firms moving into international markets are exposed to new products and pro-\ncesses. If they learn about those products and processes and integrate this knowledge into their \noperations, further innovation can be developed.159 To incorporate the learning into their own \nR&D processes, firms must manage processes effectively to absorb and use the new knowledge \nto create further innovations.160 For several reasons, then, an international diversification strategy \nincreases a firm’s ability to innovate.\nThe relationship among international geographic diversification, innovation, and returns is \ncomplex. Some level of performance is necessary to provide the resources the firm needs to diver-\nsify geographically; in turn, geographic diversification provides incentives and resources to invest \nin R&D. Effective R&D should enhance the firm’s returns, which then provide more resources for \ncontinued geographic diversification and investment in R&D.161 Of course, the returns generated \nfrom these relationships increase through effective managerial practices. Evidence suggests that \nmore culturally diverse top management teams often have a greater knowledge of international \nmarkets and their idiosyncrasies, but their orientation to expand internationally can be affected by \nthe nature of their incentives.162 Moreover, managing the business units of a geographically diverse \nmultinational firm requires skill, not only in managing a decentralized set of businesses, but also \ncoordinating diverse points of view emerging from businesses located in different countries and \nregions.163 Firms able to do this increase the likelihood of outperforming their rivals.164\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

An international diversification \nstrategy is a strategy through which a firm expands \nthe production and/or sales of its goods and/or ser-\nvices across the borders of global regions and coun-\ntries into a potentially large number of geographic \nlocations or markets. In other words, an interna-\ntional diversification strategy describes the means \nthrough which a firm develops an international  \nstrategy.\n \n● Multiple factors and conditions are leading to \nincreased international diversification, including:\n \n● the increasing use of global value chains in interna-\ntional business\n \n● digitalization and the use of global business plat-\nforms\n \n● regionalization, which occurs when firms engage in \ncountries that are part of the same region instead \nof investing in countries that are part of multiple \nregions\n \n● the desire of many firms to increase their markets \nsize beyond what is possible in their domestic mar-\nkets\n \n● the ability to expand a firm’s learning network \nacross international boundaries\n \n● the existence of scarce or uniquely valuable \nresources in some countries or regions of the \nworld\n \n● Political risks, which come from the probability that \nthe operations of multinational firms will be disrupted \nby political forces or political events, discourage inter-\nnational diversification. Legal risks, which are closely \nconnected to political risks, can also discourage this \nsort of strategy. \n \n● Economic risks include fundamental weaknesses in \na country or region’s economy with the potential to \ncause adverse effects on firms’ efforts to successfully \nimplement their international strategies. These sorts \nof risks make pursuit of an international strategy \ndifficult.\n \n● Firms that pursue international strategies also expe-\nrience management difficulties associated with \ncoordinating business operation, managing across \ndifferent country cultures, and managing relations \nwith various governments where their businesses are \nlocated.\n \n● Firms that desire to pursue an international diversi-\nfication strategy should carefully consider many fac-\ntors when deciding on which countries to enter. They \ninclude: factors of production; demand conditions; \nrelated and supporting industries; firm strategy, \nstructure, and rivalry; political, legal, and economic \nsystems; and cultural distance, which describes differ-\nences in shared norms across cultures. \n \n● There are three types of international corporate-level \nstrategies. A multidomestic strategy focuses on \ncompetition within each country in which the firm \ncompetes. Firms using a multidomestic strategy \ndecentralize strategic and operating decisions to \nthe business units operating in each country, so that \neach unit can tailor its products to local conditions. \nA global strategy assumes more standardization of \nproducts across country boundaries; therefore, a \ncompetitive strategy is centralized and controlled \nby the home office. Commonly, large multinational \nfirms, particularly those with multiple diverse prod-\nucts being sold in many different markets, use a \nmultidomestic strategy with some product lines \nand a global strategy with others. A transnational \nstrategy seeks to integrate characteristics of both \nmultidomestic and global strategies to simultane-\nously emphasize local responsiveness and global \nintegration.\n \n● A firm’s international business-level strategy is based, \nto some degree, on its international corporate-level \nstrategy. Some international corporate-level strat-\negies give individual country units the authority to \ndevelop their own business-level strategies, while \nothers dictate the business-level strategies to stan-\ndardize the firm’s products and sharing of resources \nacross countries. The former situation typically goes \nalong with a multidomestic corporate-level strategy, \nwhile the latter tends to occur when a multinational \nfirm is pursuing a global corporate-level strategy. A \nmultinational firm could have a business unit pur-\nsuing cost leadership in one country, differentiation \nin another, focus in another, and an integrated cost \nleadership/differentiation strategy in all the rest of \nthe countries.\n \n● Firms can use one or more of five entry modes to \nenter international markets. Exporting, licensing/\nfranchising, strategic alliances, acquisitions, and new \nwholly owned subsidiaries, often referred to as green-\nfield ventures, are the five entry modes. Most firms \nbegin with exporting or licensing because of their \nlower costs and risks. Later they tend to use strategic \nalliances and acquisitions as well. The most expen-\nsive and risky means of entering a new international \nmarket is establishing a new wholly owned subsidiary \n(greenfield venture). On the other hand, such subsid-\niaries provide the advantages of maximum control by \nthe firm and, if successful, the greatest returns. Large, \ngeographically diversified firms often use most or all \nfive entry modes across different markets when imple-\nmenting international strategies.\n \n● Successful use of an international diversification strategy \ncan contribute to a firm’s strategic competitiveness in \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

India has some of the lowest \nmobile rates, which has fueled growth in the OTT market. \nIndian consumers have a voracious appetite for online video \ncontent. “As a result, an entire industry has cropped up to \nserve those needs, offering enough content—movies, TV \nseries, documentaries, reality TV, and short-form—to last \nyou till your deathbed, and beyond.” By one report, a new \nOTT platform seems to emerge about every three months.\nAlthough there are dozens of OTT platforms in India, a \nfew stand out. Amazon Prime Video offers a wide selection \nof Hollywood movies and TV series, as well as Indian movies \nand TV shows. In 2021, Amazon Prime Video was the most \npopular streaming service in India. Another big contender, \nDisney + Hotstar is the third most popular streaming ser-\nvice in India. Disney + Hotstar is owned by Star India, which \nis a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company India. It has \ntwo plans: “Premium” includes international movies and TV \nseries and “Super” focuses on sports content and domestic \nprograms in a wide variety of languages. The number four \nposition belongs to JioTV, owned by Jio Platforms, which is a \nsubsidiary of Reliance Industries LTD. It is the only one of the \ntop four services that offers a dedicated app for live TV. JioTV \ndoesn’t offer any original programming, but it provides a very \nwide selection of entertainment options.\nIndian companies offering OTT platforms also include \nAha, owned by a joint venture between Geetha Arts and \nMy Home Group. Aha only provides Telugu (Indian) con-\ntent, without advertisements. Although one of the more \nrecent additions to the OTT platform market, it already has  \n2.5 million users. Voot is another Indian OTT platform that \nprovides content in Hindi, English, Tamil, Gujrati, Bengali, \nMarathi, and Kannada. All this competition from Indian and \ninternational companies has pushed pricing down to very \nlow levels, only a fraction of what streaming services charge \nin most other countries.\nWhat about Netflix? Although it ranked as the second most \npopular streaming service in India in 2021, according to one \nsource, the company is not doing well by its own standards. \nWhen Netflix enters a new country, its strategy is to target \nwealthy, young consumers in big cities first. “Then, to reach \nprogressively larger audiences, the company hires a local team \nto commission projects from the country’s biggest producers, \noffering them creative freedom they wouldn’t get elsewhere.” \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

To date, Netflix hasn’t \ncome anywhere near that number. “Netflix underestimated \nthe immense complexity and challenges India brings.” \nIn India, pay TV costs a lot less than it does in the rest of \nthe world, with prices in the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $3 \nper month. Netflix entered India with a price of about $7.50 \nper month. A while later, the company realized its error, and \nbegan lowering the price. Initially, the lower prices were only \navailable for mobile devices, but eventually, Netflix brought \nits pricing down to levels in line with the competition. \nBecause Indian laws require customers to approve a payment \neach month, cancellation rates are much higher in India than \nother countries. Also, India is a diverse nation where over 20 \nlanguages are spoken, making programming difficult.\nNetflix has deals with some of India’s biggest production \ncompanies. It released a popular series in 2020 called Bad \nBoy Billionaires, an investigative docuseries that “explores \nthe greed, fraud and corruption that built up—and ulti-\nmately brought down—India’s most infamous tycoons.” Mai: \nA Mother’s Rage is about a grieving mother who transforms \nfrom meek to merciless as she tracks down her daughter’s \nmurderer. The Fame Game is a series about the search for \nIndia’s most famous actress. Nonetheless, Netflix customers \nare still more interested in international content than Indian \ncontent. One problem is that the production companies \nwith which Netflix is working are accustomed to making big \nmovies and not series. Also, the pandemic slowed down pro-\nduction of original programs. Nonetheless, Netflix is plowing \nahead, and many of the shows it planned to make in 2021 are \ngoing into production in 2022.\nWhen asked about competition in India, Pratiksha \nRao, Netflix India’s director of films and licensing, said, \n“Competition is always great, it pushes us to do better. It also \nwidens the market, widens the supply. It’s great for the cre-\native community.” After listing several Netflix projects in a \nvariety of languages, she said, “Our aim is always to be more \nreflective of the market that we’re in. So while we are doing \noriginals in those languages, we’re also licensing a lot from \nthose languages. Whether its Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam. In \nfact, it’s very heartwarming when we premiere these films on \ndigital after the theatrical release.”\nSources: L.

How are differences between India and other coun-\ntries influencing the success of Netflix in that country?\n2. While Netflix is spending a lot on production of new \nseries and movies in India, it is also charging a lot \nless for its streaming services than it does in other \ncountries. Doesn’t this situation mean that Netflix is \ngoing to lose money in India? What could Netflix be \nthinking?\n3. What business-level strategy does Netflix seem to be \npursuing in India? How does that strategy compare to \nother companies described in the case?\n4. How do you think Netflix should change its strategy \nin India? What can it do to increase competitiveness, \nor should Netflix just abandon the Indian market? \nExplain.\nNotes\n1. C.

Coop-\nerative strategies are often used to give firms access to new markets. Alternatively, \nsome partnerships are formed between similar firms who desire to develop scale \neconomies to enhance their competitiveness. For years, automobile manufacturers \nhave formed large numbers of partnerships for this reason. In other instances, firms \ncompeting in different industries combine their unique resources to pursue what \nthey believe is a value-creating shared objective. For this reason, in 2015, Google, \nIntel, and TAG Heuer formed a partnership to design and produce a smartwatch. \nIn part, the decision Google, Intel, and TAG Heuer made to collaborate was a stra-\ntegic action taken in response to Apple’s introduction of the iWatch. The partnership \nproduced a high-end smartwatch, with the most expensive version priced at about \n$17,000. They have also produced a lower-priced smartwatch named the Connected \nModular 45 that starts at $1,650. Still, this watch serves a special luxury market niche, \nin keeping with the TAG Heuer market focus.\nGoogle has \nparlayed the knowl-\nedge it gained in the \nalliance with Intel \nand TAG Heuer into \nanother alliance with \nFitbit. For example, \nFitbit uses Google’s \n“health data stan-\ndards for apps,” as \nwell as Google’s cloud \ndata storage plat-\nform, which complies \nwith the U.S. Health \nStandards and Ac-\ncountability Act. This \nlegislation regulates \nthe use of medical \nrecords. The partner-\nship allows Fitbit to \navoid building its own \nsystem to comply with \nthis law. Fitbit CEO James \nPark says that “working \nwith Google gives us the \nopportunity to transform \nhow we scale our business, allowing us to reach more people around the world faster, \nwhile also enhancing the experience we offer to our users and the healthcare system.” \nGoogle is also working with Fitbit because its Android Wear software was unsuccessful \nin the market. After the Google alliance was announced, the price of Fitbit shares on \nthe market increased by 8 percent. \nGoogle has developed an increasingly diversified portfolio of strategic alliances. For \nexample, Google has alliances with Carrefour, a large French retailer, and Repsol, a major \nenergy firm in Spain. The alliance with Carrefour has moved to the second stage, helping \nthe firm increase its ecommerce presence. Alternatively, the alliance with Repsol is using \nGoogle’s machine-learning tool to deploy big data and artificial intelligence tools across \nRepsol’s refineries. Google shut down its search engine activity in China in 2010, and \nrather than taking actions to re-enter the market, it started a research center in China and \nsigned an agreement to form an alliance with Tencent, a large Chinese conglomerate.\nAdditionally, Google formed an alliance partnership with Information Resources, Inc. \n(IRI) to conduct marketing mix analyses. This work is part of Google’s Google Measure-\nment Partners program launched in 2018. The intent of this program (and its alliance \nwith IRI) is to provide high quality and choice to its advertisers across multiple areas of \nspecialization. IRI will help bolster Google’s marketing efforts. In another partnership, \nGoogle formed a 10-year alliance with AES Corporation “to accelerate the expansion and \nadoption of clean energy by leveraging Google Cloud technology.” Also, Google formed \n© anilakkus / Getty Images\nFABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images\nGuy Semon (Tag Heuer), Jean-Claude Biver (Tag Heuer), Michael \nBell (Intel), and David Singleton (Google) pose with a block of Swiss \ncheese at the announcement of the new partnership between the \nwatch brand and the two giants of Silicon Valley.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Google also continues to invest heavily in R&D to develop new technol-\nogies and services (e.g., in artificial intelligence and many other areas). Thus, we can expect \nGoogle to be a dominant force in high technology for years to come.\nSources: 2022, How many partnerships does Google have?

Google has also \ndeveloped alliances with Fitbit, Carrefour, Repsol, Tencent, IRI, AES, and TELUS; in each case, \nthe firms and Google have complementary resources to use in the alliance. Thus, as is the case \nfor all companies implementing cooperative strategies, Google and its alliance partners intend \nto use their resources in ways that will create the greatest amount of value for stakeholders.1\nForming a cooperative strategy like those that Google has formed, such as the one with Intel \nand TAG Heuer, has the potential to help companies reach an objective that is important to all \nthe partners, such as firm growth. Specifically, a cooperative strategy is a means by which firms \ncollaborate to achieve a shared objective.2 Cooperating with others can help a firm create value for \na customer that it likely could not create by itself. As noted in the Opening Case, this is the situa-\ntion for Google, Intel, and TAG Heuer, in that none of these firms could have created the intended \nhigh-end smartwatch without the combination of the three companies’ resources. (Throughout \nthis chapter, the term “resources” is used comprehensively and refers to a firm’s capabilities as well \nas its resources.)\nFirms also try to create competitive advantages when using a cooperative strategy.3 A com-\npetitive advantage developed through a cooperative strategy often is called a collaborative or rela-\ntional advantage, indicating that the relationship that develops among collaborating partners is \ncommonly the basis on which to build a competitive advantage.4 Successfully using cooperative \nstrategies can help a firm to outperform its rivals in terms of strategic competitiveness and earn \nabove-average returns.5\nWe examine several topics in this chapter. First, we define and offer examples of different stra-\ntegic alliances as primary types of cooperative strategies. We focus on strategic alliances because \nfirms use them more frequently than other types of cooperative relationships. In succession, we \ndescribe business-level, corporate-level, international, and network cooperative strategies. This \nchapter closes with a discussion of the risks of using cooperative strategies and how effectively \nmanaging the strategies can reduce these risks.\n9-2 Strategic Alliances as a Primary Type  \nof Cooperative Strategy\nA strategic alliance is a cooperative strategy in which firms combine some of their resources to \ncreate a competitive advantage.6 Firms use strategic alliances to leverage their existing resources \nwhile working with partners to develop additional resources as the foundation for new competitive \nLearning Objective\n9-1 Define cooperative \nstrategies and explain \nwhy firms use them.\nA cooperative strategy \nis a means by which firms \ncollaborate to achieve a \nshared objective.\nA strategic alliance is \na cooperative strategy in \nwhich firms combine some \nof their resources to create a \ncompetitive advantage.\nLearning Objective\n9-2 Define and discuss \nthe three major types of \nstrategic alliances.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Alliances are a vital strategy that firms use to \ntry to outperform rivals.7\n9-2a Types of Major Strategic Alliances\nJoint ventures, equity strategic alliances, and nonequity \nstrategic alliances are the three major types of strategic \nalliances firms use. The ownership arrangement is a key \ndifference among these alliances.\nA joint venture is a strategic alliance in which two or \nmore firms create a legally independent company to share \nsome of their resources to create a competitive advan-\ntage.8 Typically, partners in a joint venture own equal \npercentages and contribute equally to the venture’s oper-\nations. In fact, research evidence exists that equal owner-\nship is associated with higher performing joint ventures.9 \nOften formed to improve a firm’s ability to compete in uncertain competitive environments, joint \nventures can be effective in establishing long-term relationships and in transferring knowledge \nbetween partners.10\nGeneral Motors and China-based SAIC Motor Corp. Ltd., China’s largest automobile man-\nufacturer by sales volume, formed a joint venture to develop new cars that cater specifically to \nChinese tastes. Called Shanghai General Motors Corporation Limited, each partner controls  \n50 percent of this cooperative enterprise. These companies have also partnered in other ways. For \nexample, Shanghai OnStar, a joint venture between these two companies, is the leader in telematics \nfor automobiles in China. Also, SAIC and GM agreed for SAIC to take over GM’s Opel manufac-\nturing plant in India, which allows SAIC to enter India’s automobile market.11 Demonstrating the \ncomplexities associated with being a successful competitor in today’s business environment is the \nfact that SAIC also has a joint venture with Volkswagen. Among other products, the SAIC-VW \njoint venture manufactures the Tiguan sport-utility model, which is the number one foreign-brand \nSUV being sold in China.12\nBecause it can’t be codified, tacit knowledge, which is increasingly critical to firms’ efforts to \ndevelop competitive advantages, is learned through experiences such as those taking place when \npeople from partner firms work together in a joint venture.13 Overall, a joint venture may be the \noptimal type of cooperative arrangement when firms need to combine their resources to create \na competitive advantage that is substantially different from any they possess individually, when \nknowledge sharing is important to success, and when the partners intend to compete in highly \nuncertain environments.\nAn equity strategic alliance is an alliance in which a firm purchases equity in another firm, \nwhich means that it is now a partial owner of that firm. “In exchange for the equity interest, the firm \nis required to join a partnership and contribute a lump sum of capital. These equity investments \nare typically made through a direct purchase of shares in the firm.”14 Equity strategic alliances can \nlead to competitive advantage because they can help firms refocus their efforts due to the addition \nof new resources. They are also helpful if there is an opportunity that is too expensive, complex, or \nrisky to be pursued by one firm on its own. “Panasonic’s $30 million investment in Tesla is a good \nexample of an equity strategic alliance. Along with the purchase of Tesla stock, Panasonic also \nbrought its cutting-edge battery cell technology to the partnership.”15\nA nonequity strategic alliance is an alliance in which two or more firms develop a con-\ntractual relationship to share some of their resources in pursuit of a mutually beneficial proj-\nect.16 In this type of alliance, firms do not establish a separate independent company, nor do \nthey take equity positions in each other. For this reason, nonequity strategic alliances are less \nformal, demand fewer partner commitments than do joint ventures and equity strategic alli-\nances, and often do not foster an intimate relationship between partners; nonetheless, research \nevidence indicates that they can create value for the involved firms.17 The relative informality \nand lower commitment levels characterizing nonequity strategic alliances make them unsuit-\nable for complex projects where success requires partners to effectively transfer tacit knowl-\nedge to each other.18 Licensing agreements, distribution agreements, and supply contracts are \nexamples of nonequity strategic alliances.\nA joint venture is a strategic \nalliance in which two or \nmore firms create a legally \nindependent company to \nshare some of their resources \nto create a competitive \nadvantage.\nAn equity strategic \nalliance is an alliance in \nwhich a firm purchases equity \nin another firm, which means \nthat it is now a partial owner \nof that firm. \nA nonequity strategic \nalliance is an alliance in \nwhich two or more firms \ndevelop a contractual \nrelationship to share some of \ntheir resources in pursuit of a \nmutually beneficial project.\nShanghai GM.PNG\nShanghai GM facility where the work of the firms’ joint venture takes \nplace.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

        "content": "Part 2: Strategic Actions: Strategy Formulation\n226\nCommonly, outsourcing arrangements are organized \nin the form of a nonequity strategic alliance. (Discussed \nin Chapter 3, outsourcing is the purchase of a value-chain \nactivity or a support-function activity from another \nfirm.) Apple Inc. and most other companies involved \nwith selling computers, tablets, and smartphones use \nnonequity strategic alliances to outsource most or all \nthe activities required to manufacture their products. \nApple, for example, outsources most of its manufac-\nturing to Foxconn and Pegatron, both based in Taiwan \n(although most iPhones are assembled in China of parts \nmade around the world).19 Firms often choose to use \nnonequity strategic alliances to outsource manufactur-\ning activities to emerging market companies because of \nthe cost efficiencies those firms generate through scale \neconomies.\n9-2b Reasons Firms Develop Strategic Alliances\nCooperative strategies are an integral part of the competitive landscape and are important to many \ncompanies. In addition to partnerships among for-profit organizations, alliances are also formed \nbetween educational institutions and individual companies to commercialize ideas flowing from \nbasic research projects that are completed at universities.20 Moreover, in addition to dyadic part-\nnerships where two firms form a collaborative relationship for competitive purposes, competition \nnow occurs between large alliances in some industries. This pattern of competition exists in the \nglobal airline industry where individual airlines compete against each other but simultaneously \njoin alliances (such as Star, Oneworld, and SkyTeam—the three largest Airline Alliances), which \nin turn compete against each other.21 What the alliance means for customers is that booking a \nflight may include legs on various carriers in the alliance. What it means for the airlines is shared \nresources and increased utilization of current resources. The array of alliances with which firms \nare involved highlights the various options available to companies seeking to increase their com-\npetitiveness by cooperating with others.\nOverall, firms choose to participate in strategic alliances for many reasons. We mention two \nkey reasons here and discuss additional ones below by explaining how strategic alliances may help \nfirms improve their competitiveness while competing in slow-, fast-, or standard-cycle markets.\nThe first important reason firms form strategic alliances is to create value they couldn’t generate \nby acting independently, which often includes entering markets more rapidly.22 This is demon-\nstrated in a joint venture SK Innovation of Korea formed with Ford Motor Company (Ford) to \nbuild two battery factories in North America. The factory is expected to produce enough batteries \nfor 600,000 electric vehicles per year by 2025.23 The joint venture gives SK Innovation access to a \nhuge North American market that would have been difficult to achieve otherwise. \nA second major reason firms form strategic alliances is that most (if not all) companies lack the \nfull set of resources needed to pursue all attractive opportunities available to them as they pursue \ntheir objectives.24 Given constrained resources, firms can collaborate for many purposes, including \nreaching new customers and broadening both the product offerings and the distribution of their \nproducts without adding significantly to their cost structures. Alternatively, firms with greater cash \nand other resources might form alliances to enter multiple markets, allowing them to compete \nmore effectively with rivals across markets and/or to forestall rivals’ entrance or certain competitive \nactions in certain markets.25\nAn alliance formed by Barnes & Noble and Starbucks illustrates how a partnership can allow a \nfirm to reach new customers without a huge strain on resources. Having Starbucks coffee shops in \nBarnes & Noble bookstores allows customers to peruse new books while enjoying a fresh cup of coffee. \nBoth firms profit from this partnership. Starbucks has also partnered with grocery store chains, and it \nis not unusual to be able to buy a cup of coffee from a Starbucks coffee shop while buying groceries.26 \nAs we discussed in Chapter 5, when considering competitive rivalry and competitive dynamics, \nunique competitive conditions characterize slow-, fast-, and standard-cycle markets.27 As Figure 9.1  \nshows, these unique market types create different reasons for firms to use strategic alliances.  \nFoxconn manufacturer working to produce iPhones for Apple.\nSource: Zdnet\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

For example, Carnival Corporation, owner and operator of Carnival \nCruise Line, formed two joint ventures with state-owned China Merchants Group, which is a con-\nglomerate with businesses in financial investments and property development as well as transpor-\ntation. One venture between the two firms focuses on shipbuilding while the second concentrates \non developing new ports and travel destinations in and around China. The launching of China’s \nfirst domestic cruise brand that will target Chinese customers is one outcome associated with the \ncollaborations between the two companies. Carnival’s interest with these joint ventures is to com-\npete in China, where the cruise industry is beginning to grow rapidly. The shipbuilding venture \nlaunched its first new cruise ship in December 2021.30\nSlow-cycle markets are becoming rare in the twenty-first-century competitive landscape for \nseveral reasons, including the privatization of industries and economies, the rapid expansion of the \nInternet’s capabilities for quick dissemination of information, and the speed with which advancing \ntechnologies make quickly imitating even complex products possible.31 Firms competing \nin slow-cycle markets should recognize the likelihood that in the future, they will encounter \nsituations in which their competitive advantages become partially sustainable (in the instance of a  \nstandard-cycle market) or unsustainable (in the case of a fast-cycle market). \nFigure 9.1 Reasons for Strategic Alliances by Market Type\n Reasons for Using a Strategic Alliance\n•    Gain access to \n     a restricted\n     market\n•    Establish a\n     franchise in a\n     new market\n•    Maintain\n     market stability\n     (e.g., establishing\n     standards)\n•    Speed up\n     development of\n     new goods or\n     services\n•    Speed up new\n     market entry\n•    Maintain market\n     leadership\n•    Form an industry\n     technology\n     standard\n•    Share risky R&D\n     expenses\n•    Overcome\n     uncertainty\n•    Gain market\n     power (reduce\n     industry\n     overcapacity)\n•    Gain access to\n     complementary\n     resources\n•    Establish better\n     economies of\n     scale\n•    Overcome trade\n     barriers\n•    Meet competitive\n     challenges from\n     other competitors\n•    Pool resources for\n     very large capital\n     projects\n•    Learn new\n     business\n     techniques\nMarket Type\nSlow-Cycle\nFast-Cycle\nStandard-\nCycle\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Alliances between firms with current excess resources and those with prom-\nising resources help companies competing in fast-cycle markets effectively transition from the \npresent to the future and gain rapid entry into new markets. Alliances can also help firms to gain \nlegitimacy more quickly in new markets.33\nHigh-technology industries are excellent examples of fast-cycle markets, and firms often create \npartnerships that help them remain competitive. For example, Ford and security specialist ADT \njointly invested $105 million into a new venture called Canopy that provides high-tech security \nsystems for vehicles to prevent burglary and theft. The venture will begin providing its new service \nfor commercial vehicles in the United States and United Kingdom in 2023, but it intends to extend \nthis service to other consumers in the future. Technology used in the venture will include sensors, \nhuman monitors, cameras, and artificial intelligence “that can distinguish a bird from a burglar.”34\nStandard-Cycle Markets\nIn standard-cycle markets, alliances are more likely to be made by partners that have complemen-\ntary resources.35 Participating in an alliance can enhance a firm’s market power through strength in \nnumbers. The alliances formed by airline companies, briefly mentioned earlier in this chapter, are \nan example of standard-cycle market alliances. Three major airline alliances are operating today: \nStar Alliance (27 airlines), SkyTeam Alliance (20 airlines), and Oneworld Alliance (14 airlines).36\nWhen initially established, airline alliances were intended to allow firms to share their comple-\nmentary resources to make it easier for passengers to fly between secondary cities in the United \nStates and Europe. Today, airline alliances are mostly global and are formed primarily so members \ncan gain marketing clout, have opportunities to reduce costs, and have access to additional inter-\nnational routes.37 Of these reasons, international expansion by having access to more international \nroutes is the most important because these routes are the path to increased revenues and potential \nprofits. To support efforts to control costs, alliance members jointly purchase some items and share \nfacilities, such as passenger gates, customer service centers, and airport passenger lounges, when \npossible. For passengers, airline alliances create benefits such as less complicated ticket buying pro-\ncesses, easier connections for international flights, and the earning of frequent flyer miles.\n9-3 Business-Level Cooperative Strategy\nA business-level cooperative strategy is a strategy through which firms combine some of their \nresources to create a competitive advantage by competing in one or more product markets. As \ndiscussed in Chapter 4, business-level strategy details what the firm intends to do to gain a com-\npetitive advantage in specific product markets. Thus, the firm forms a business-level cooperative \nstrategy when it believes that combining some of its resources with those of one or more partners \nwill create competitive advantages that it can’t create alone and lead to success in a specific product \nmarket. We present the four business-level cooperative strategies in Figure 9.2.\n9-3a Complementary Strategic Alliances\nComplementary strategic alliances are business-level alliances in which firms share some of their \nresources in complementary ways to create a competitive advantage.38 Vertical and horizontal are \nthe two dominant types of complementary strategic alliances (see Figure 9.2).\nVertical Complementary Strategic Alliance\nIn a vertical complementary strategic alliance, firms share some of their resources from different \nstages of the value chain to create a competitive advantage (see Figure 9.3).39 Oftentimes, verti-\ncal complementary alliances are formed to adapt to environmental changes, and sometimes, the \nchanges represent an opportunity for partnering firms to innovate while adapting.40 For example, \nHonda teamed up with Sony to build electric vehicles. Honda is way behind competitors in the \nelectric vehicle market. Sony was once a market leader in portable electronic devices but lost \nits position to Apple, Samsung, and others. Discussing the joint venture, “Sony CEO Kenichiro \nLearning Objective\n9-3 Name the business-\nlevel cooperative \nstrategies and describe \ntheir use.\nA business-level \ncooperative strategy is \na strategy through which \nfirms combine some of \ntheir resources to create a \ncompetitive advantage by \ncompeting in one or more \nproduct markets.\nComplementary strategic \nalliances are business-level \nalliances in which firms share \nsome of their resources \nin complementary ways \nto create a competitive \nadvantage.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The \ncompany provides services in areas that include strategy and con-\nsulting, creativity and technology, and operations to practically every \nindustry imaginable, including health, aerospace, chemical, life sci-\nences, travel, utilities, insurance, capital markets, and the federal gov-\nernment. The company employs approximately 699,000 employees \nand has operations in more than 200 cities in 50 countries. Among \nother things, Accenture is “the largest independent technology ser-\nvices provider,” and partners with many high-technology companies, \nincluding SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, and Microsoft.\nAccenture Interactive is a unit within Accenture that specializes \nin digital services, especially for the advertising industry. In 2017, it \nacquired an Irish agency named Rothco. Shortly thereafter, Rothco \nwon industry awards for its creation called “JFK: Unsilenced,” in which \nartificial intelligence was used to create a version of a never-heard \nspeech by John F. Kennedy, a U.S. president who was assassinated \nwhile in office. In 2019, Accenture Interactive was recognized by Fast \nCompany as one of the most innovative advertising companies.\nJulie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture, describes the ethical \norientation of the company’s employees in these words: “Across the \nglobe, one thing is universally true of the people of Accenture: We \ncare deeply about what we do and the impact we have with our cli-\nents and communities. It is personal to all of us.” A recent alliance \nbetween Accenture Interactive’s Rothco Unit, Warner Music, and \nApple Music provides evidence to support this statement. \nThe alliance can be described in these words, “For people with \nspeech disorders, repetition is key to the treatment. But when it \ncomes to kids, they find repetition boring. So, we wanted to see if \nthere was a way to connect the world of speech therapy to the world \nwhere repetition is fun: music.” Rothco partnered with Warner Music \nand Apple Music and analyzed over 70 million songs, looking for any \nsongs in which problem sounds occur that can be helpful during \nspeech therapy. The songs were then converted into “Saylists” that \nhelp make speech therapy fun for children. This alliance was listed as \none of the most innovative in 2022 by Fast Company.\nSources: D.

Such alliances often help \nthem to weather economic recessions and rivals’ actions.42 Some of the world’s largest pharma-\nceutical firms, including Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, and Eli Lilly, are sharing \nsome of their proprietary assets through a collaboration organized by the U.S.-based National \nInstitutes of Health; the objective is to more quickly develop drugs that cure and treat challenging \nand historically intractable diseases. Pharmaceutical company alliances played an important role \nin developing and producing a vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.43\nOne of the distinguishing features of most horizontal alliances is that firms that compete \nwith each other for a share of the same markets also cooperate with each other. Coopetition is \nthe term used to describe simultaneous cooperation and competition among firms at the same \nstage of the value chain in the same industry.44 Research indicates a higher level of performance \nfor firms that engage in coopetition.45 Researchers also found a higher level of innovative per-\nformance in alliances when the environment is characterized by a high level of competition.46 \nPerhaps this is because of the necessity to cooperate to remain competitive. Coopetition brought \nGeneral Motors and Honda together in an alliance to develop affordable electric vehicles for the \nmass market.47 The first of these vehicles is expected to cost less than $30,000 in the United States \nand be introduced to the market in 2027. Remember also that Honda is engaged in a vertical \nalliance with Sony to build electric vehicles. It will be interesting to see how Honda manages \nthese two alliances with similar objectives.\nCoopetition involves \nsimultaneous cooperation \nand competition among firms \nat the same stage of the value \nchain in the same industry.\nFigure 9.3 Vertical and Horizontal Complementary Strategic Alliances\nHorizontal Alliance between Buyers (Each buyer is also a potential competitor)\nCustomer Value\nSupport Functions\nFinance\nResearch\n& \nDevelopment\nHuman Resources\nManagement\nInformation Technology\nManagement\nVertical Alliance - Supplier\nValue Chain\nActivities\nSupply-Chain\nManagement\nOperations\nDistribution\nMarketing\n(Including\nSales)\nFollow-Up\nService\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In an interesting study of \n215 R&D alliances among pharmaceutical firms, researchers found that these types of alliances are \nmore prone to joint value creation, whereas if firms in the alliance are in the same product markets, \nthey are more likely to use the alliance to attempt to appropriate value for themselves.48 This study \nsuggests that innovation is stifled when firms that are too close as competitors (i.e., sell the same \nproducts to the same customers) engage in horizontal alliances. \nSometimes the desired outcomes of horizontal alliances are difficult to achieve. The parties \nto the alliance may not agree on how to combine their complementary resources, and the other \nalliances each partner has in its alliance portfolio can also affect the performance of the alliance \nover time.49\n9-3b Competition Response Strategy\nAs discussed in Chapter 5, competitors initiate competitive actions (strategic and tactical) to \nattack rivals and launch competitive responses (strategic and tactical) to their competitors’ \nactions. Strategic alliances can be used at the business level to respond to competitors’ attacks. \nThe alliance among Google, Intel, and TAG Heuer that is discussed in the Opening Case is \na strategic response to Apple’s strategic action of introducing the iWatch. Because strategic  \nalliances can be difficult to reverse and expensive to operate, they are primarily formed to  \ntake strategic rather than tactical actions and to respond to competitors’ actions in a like \nmanner.\nIn October 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company formed a partnership. \nAt the time, these firms held the second and third largest shares of the U.S. brewing market. \nWhen formed, MillerCoors LLC commanded roughly 29 percent of the U.S. brewing market. \nHowever, Anheuser-Busch held 49 percent of the market. Indeed, the MillerCoors collaboration \nwas a response to the size and scale of Anheuser-Busch’s operations. (Anheuser-Busch itself was \nacquired by InBev in 2008, an acquisition that created the world’s largest brewer.) Indicating that \nthe collaboration would result in significant cost reductions and an ability to generate economies \nof scale through the firms’ combined operations, a company official said that Miller and Coors \nwould be stronger and more competitive together than either company would be on its own. \nHowever, the reduction in competition within the industry resulting from the MillerCoors joint \nventure led to price increases outsiders did not expect. In fact, a study economists conducted \nfound that prices of beer products were 17–18 percent higher after the joint venture was consum-\nmated and as much as 8 percent higher than other factors explain. Thus, some alliances formed \nas competitive responses, particularly those that reduce overall competition, may have some \nunintended consequences.50\n9-3c \nUncertainty-Reducing Strategy\nFirms sometimes use business-level strategic alliances to hedge against risk and uncertainty, espe-\ncially in fast-cycle markets.51 These strategies are also used where uncertainty exists, such as in \nentering new product markets, especially those within emerging economies. The development of \nnew products to enter new markets and the entry into emerging markets often carry with them \nsignificant risks. Thus, to reduce or mollify these risks, firms often develop R&D alliances and \nalliances with emerging market firms, respectively.52 \nAnother type of risk alliances address is being left behind the competition when applying \nnew technologies. Electric vehicles are a technology with far-reaching implications for virtually \nevery business on the planet. Ceres, a non-profit Boston-based sustainability group, launched the \nCorporate Electric Vehicle Alliance to help companies transition to electric vehicles. Members \nof the alliance include Amazon, IKEA, DHL (trucking), AT&T, Genentech, and Siemens, among \nothers. Sue Reid, VP of Climate and Energy at Ceres, explained: “The climate crisis demands we \ndecarbonize transportation—the highest-emitting sector in the U.S.—and electric vehicles are \nan essential component of this transition.”53 One of the goals of the alliance is to encourage the \nproduction of a wider array of electric vehicles. By participating in this alliance, member com-\npanies will be in a much better position to lead in the transition to electric vehicles rather than \nplaying catch-up.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Accord-\ningly, companies choosing to explicitly collude with other firms should recognize that competitors \nand regulatory bodies likely will challenge the acceptability of their competitive actions.\nTacit collusion exists when several firms in an industry indirectly coordinate their production \nand pricing decisions by observing each other’s competitive actions and responses.56 Tacit collusion \ntends to take place in industries dominated by a few large firms. It results in production output that \nis below fully competitive levels and above fully competitive prices. Researchers have found that \nstrategic alliances among competitors reduce the likelihood that these firms will engage in compet-\nitive behavior that is damaging to the firms with which they are partnering (i.e., price wars).57 In \naddition to the effects on competition within a particular market, research suggests that tacit collu-\nsion between two firms can lead to less competition in other markets in which both firms operate.58\nAs suggested above, tacit collusion tends to be used as a competition-reducing, business-level \nstrategy in industries with a high degree of concentration, such as the airline and breakfast cereal \nindustries. Research in the airline industry suggests that tacit collusion reduces service quality \nand on-time performance and leads to higher prices.59 Firms in these industries recognize their \ninterdependence, which means that their competitive actions and responses significantly affect \ncompetitors’ behavior toward them. Understanding this interdependence and carefully observing \ncompetitors can lead to tacit collusion. It can occur in other industries as well. For example, we \nnoted earlier that the MillerCoors joint venture led to a large price increase on the MillerCoors and \nAnheuser-Busch beers. When prices are above the competitive level in an industry, it is logical to \nassume that the dominant firms use a tacit collusion cooperative strategy.\nMutual forbearance is a form of tacit collusion in which firms do not take competitive actions \nagainst rivals they meet in multiple markets. Rivals learn a great deal about each other when engag-\ning in multimarket competition, including how to deter the effects of their rivals’ competitive \nattacks and responses. Given what they know about each other as competitors, firms choose not to \nengage in what could be destructive competition in multiple product markets.60 \nIn general, governments in free-market economies seek to determine how rivals can form \ncooperative strategies to increase their competitiveness without violating established regulations \nabout competition.61 For example, “U.S. antitrust enforcers sued American Airlines Group Inc. and \nJetBlue Airways Corp. to unwind their agreement to coordinate flights in the U.S. Northeast, saying \nthe pact violates antitrust laws by eliminating competition between them.”62 In an interesting twist, \nAmerican and JetBlue ignored the lawsuit and expanded alliance benefits for their customers just \nthree weeks later.63\nOther actions can be taken to reduce competition other than collusion. For example, firms may \nengage in alliances to build their knowledge. In doing so, they can create capabilities that allow \nthem to outmaneuver their competitors, perhaps even forestalling their entry into market niches \nor disallowing their access to market share.64 Also, some firms may forestall competition through \nrapid actions that capture and hold customers. For example, some firms rapidly introduced greener \ntechnology strategies throughout their supply chains (including alliance partners), satisfying cus-\ntomers’ desires for a cleaner environment.65 In the final analysis, individual companies must ana-\nlyze the effect of a competition-reducing strategy on their performance and competitiveness and \ndecide if pursuing such a strategy facilitates or inhibits their competitive success.\n9-3e Assessing Business-Level Cooperative Strategies\nFirms use business-level cooperative strategies to develop competitive advantages that can con-\ntribute to successful positions in individual product markets. Evidence suggests that comple-\nmentary business-level strategic alliances, especially vertical ones, have the greatest probability \nof creating a competitive advantage and possibly even a sustainable one.66 Horizontal com-\nplementary alliances are sometimes difficult to maintain precisely because they are formed \nbetween firms that compete against each other at the same time they are cooperating.67 \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

However, the need to develop scale economies and to share resources (such \nas scheduling systems) dictates that alliances be formed so the companies can compete by using \ncooperative actions and responses, while they simultaneously compete against one another \nthrough competitive actions and responses. The challenge in these instances is for each firm \nto find ways to create the greatest amount of value from their simultaneous competitive and \ncooperative actions.\nAlthough strategic alliances designed to respond to competition and to reduce uncertainty can \nalso create competitive advantages, these advantages often are more temporary than those devel-\noped through complementary (both vertical and horizontal) alliances. The primary reason for \nthis is that complementary alliances have a stronger focus on creating value than do competition- \nreducing and uncertainty-reducing alliances.68\n9-4 Corporate-Level Cooperative Strategy\nA corporate-level cooperative strategy is a strategy through which a firm collaborates with one \nor more companies to expand its operations. Diversifying alliances, synergistic alliances, and fran-\nchising are the most commonly used corporate-level cooperative strategies (see Figure 9.4).\nWhen a firm seeks to diversify into markets in which the host nation’s government makes \nacquisitions difficult, alliances become an especially appropriate option. Corporate-level strate-\ngic alliances are also attractive compared with alliances because they require fewer resource com-\nmitments and permit greater flexibility in terms of efforts to diversify partners’ operations.69 An  \nalliance can be used to determine whether the partners might benefit from a future merger or \nacquisition between them.70 This “testing” process often characterizes alliances formed to combine \nfirms’ unique technological resources and capabilities.\n9-4a Diversifying Strategic Alliance\nA diversifying strategic alliance is a strategy in which firms share some of their resources to \nengage in product and/or geographic diversification. Companies using this strategy typically seek \nto enter new markets (either domestic or outside of their home setting) with existing products or \nwith newly developed products. For example, Fratelli Wines is an Indo-Italian alliance formed \nwith the objective of applying Italian wine-making methods in India. The alliance has produced \naward-winning wines.71\nManaging diversity gained through alliances has fewer financial costs compared to greenfield \nventures (explained in Chapter 8) but often requires more managerial expertise. The need for \nexpertise in managing diversity is heightened by the fact that the focal firm has less control over \nthe partner. Managers must coordinate and build trust to coordinate alliance activities. Addition-\nally, they must work at understanding their diverse partners and their capabilities to successfully \ncoordinate within the alliance.72\n9-4b Synergistic Strategic Alliance\nA synergistic strategic alliance is a strategy in which firms share some of their resources to \ncreate economies of scope. Similar to the business-level horizontal complementary strategic \nalliance, synergistic strategic alliances create synergy across multiple functions or multiple busi-\nnesses between partner firms.73 A common example of a synergistic alliance is when firms \npartner across the value chain. When supply chain partners co-align, they often can create \nsynergistic benefits enjoyed by both partners.74 Synergy in sharing resources is more common \nLearning Objective\n9-4 Discuss the use \nof corporate-level \ncooperative strategies.\nA corporate-level \ncooperative strategy is \na strategy through which a \nfirm collaborates with one or \nmore companies to expand \nits operations.\nA diversifying strategic \nalliance is a strategy in \nwhich firms share some of \ntheir resources to engage in \nproduct and/or geographic \ndiversification.\nA synergistic strategic \nalliance is a strategy in \nwhich firms share some of \ntheir resources to create \neconomies of scope.\nFigure 9.4 Corporate-Level Cooperative Strategies\nCorporate-Level Cooperative Strategies\nDiversifying\nalliances\nSynergistic\nalliances\nFranchising\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In fact, some firms that have developed \nstrong ambidexterity (perhaps through alliances) in turn are able to form alliances and search \nfor their partner’s special skills or resources (prospective resourcing).75 \nThe partnership between French-based Renault SA and Japan-based Nissan Motor Com-\npany was formed in 1999 as a synergistic strategic alliance, That means, among other out-\ncomes, that the firms seek to create economies of scope by sharing their resources to develop \nmanufacturing platforms to produce cars that will carry either the Renault or the Nissan brand. \nLater, the firms added Mitsubishi to this alliance to become the largest automotive alliance in \nthe world.76\n9-4c \nFranchising\nFranchising was first mentioned in Chapter 4 as a type of business model and again in Chapter 8  \nas a technique for entering a country for the first time. Franchising is a strategy in which a \nfirm (the franchisor) uses a franchise as a contractual relationship to describe and control the \nsharing of its resources with its partners (the franchisees).77 A franchise is a “form of business \norganization in which a firm that already has a successful product or service (the franchisor) \nlicenses its trademark and method of doing business to other businesses (the franchisees) in \nexchange for an initial franchise fee and an ongoing royalty rate.”78 Often, the effectiveness \nof these strategic alliances is a product of how well the franchisor can replicate its success \nacross multiple partners in a cost-effective way.79 As with diversifying and synergistic strate-\ngic alliances, franchising is an alternative to pursuing growth through mergers and acquisi-\ntions. McDonald’s, Choice Hotels International, Hilton International, Marriott International,  \nMrs. Fields Cookies, Subway, and Ace Hardware are well-known firms using the franchising \ncorporate-level cooperative strategy.\nFranchising is a particularly attractive strategy to use in fragmented industries, such as \nretailing, hotels and motels, and commercial printing. In fragmented industries, many small \nand medium-sized firms compete as rivals; however, no firm or small set of firms has a dom-\ninant share, making it possible for a company to gain a large market share by consolidating \nindependent companies through the contractual relationships that are a part of a franchise \nagreement.\nIn the most successful franchising strategy, the partners (the franchisor and the franchi-\nsees) work closely together.80 A primary responsibility of the franchisor is to develop programs \nto transfer to the franchisees the knowledge and skills that are needed to successfully compete \nat the local level.81 In return, franchisees should provide feedback to the franchisor regard-\ning how their units could become more effective and efficient.82 Working cooperatively, the  \nfranchisor and its franchisees find ways to strengthen the core company’s brand name, which \nis often the most important competitive advantage for franchisees operating in their local \nmarkets.83\n9-4d Assessing Corporate-Level Cooperative Strategies\nCosts are incurred to implement each type of cooperative strategy.84 Compared with their business- \nlevel counterparts, corporate-level cooperative strategies commonly are broader in scope and more \ncomplex, making them relatively more challenging and costly to use.\nDespite these costs, firms can create competitive advantages and customer value by effectively \nusing corporate-level cooperative strategies.85 Internalizing successful alliance experiences makes \nit more likely that the strategy will attain the desired advantages.86 In other words, those involved \nwith forming and using corporate-level cooperative strategies can also use them to develop useful \nknowledge about how to succeed in the future. To gain maximum value from this knowledge, firms \nshould organize it and verify that it is always properly distributed to those involved with forming \nand using alliances.\nWe explained in Chapter 6 that firms answer two questions when dealing with corporate-level \nstrategy: in which businesses and product markets will the firm choose to compete, and how \nwill those businesses be managed? These questions are also answered as firms form corporate- \nlevel cooperative strategies. Thus, firms able to develop corporate-level cooperative strategies \nand manage them in ways that are valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and nonsubstitutable  \nFranchising is a strategy in \nwhich a firm (the franchisor) \nuses a franchise as a \ncontractual relationship to \ndescribe and control the \nsharing of its resources with \nits partners (the franchisees).\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In Chapter 7, we discussed cross-border acquisitions—actions through which a \ncompany located in one country acquires a firm located in a different country. In Chapter 8, \nwe described how firms use cross-border strategic alliances and joint ventures as a way of \nentering international markets. Here in Chapter 9, we pick up on that discussion and examine \ncross-border strategic alliances as a type of international cooperative strategy. Thus, as the \ndiscussions in Chapters 7, 8, and 9 show, firms engage in cross-border activities to achieve \nseveral related and often complementary objectives.\nA cross-border strategic alliance is a strategy in which firms with headquarters in differ-\nent countries decide to combine some of their resources to create a competitive advantage.87 \nThese alliances are sometimes formed instead of mergers and acquisitions, which can be risk-\nier. Even though cross-border alliances can themselves be complex and difficult to manage, \nthey have the potential to help firms use some of their resources to create value in locations \noutside their home market. Through this collaboration, the partners often cooperate in one \nor more areas such as development, procurement, and production processes, partly with the \nintent to create value in markets throughout the world that neither firm could create operating \nindependently.88 \nLimited domestic growth opportunities and foreign government economic policies are key \nreasons firms use cross-border alliances. As discussed in Chapter 8, local ownership is an \nimportant national policy objective in some nations. In India and China, for example, govern-\nmental policies reflect a strong preference to license local companies. In some cases, a firm \nmay even be required (or find it highly advantageous) to partner with a political institution in \nthe host country, which brings with it a new set of risks (including the risk that the political \npartner may expropriate the profits).89 Thus, in some countries, the full range of entry-mode \nchoices we described in Chapter 8 may not be available to firms seeking to geographically \ndiversify. Indeed, investment by foreign firms in these instances may be allowed only through \na partnership with a local firm, such as in a cross-border alliance. \nIn spite of these sorts of difficulties, strategic alliances with local partners can help firms \novercome the liability of foreignness associated with moving into a foreign country, includ-\ning problems related to a lack of knowledge of the local culture or institutional norms.90 A \ncross-border strategic alliance can also help foreign partners from an operational perspective— \nthe local partner has significantly more information about factors contributing to competitive \nsuccess, such as local markets, sources of capital, legal procedures, and politics.91 Interestingly, \nresearch results suggest that firms with foreign operations have longer survival rates than \ndomestic-only firms, although this advantage is reduced if there are competition problems \nbetween foreign subsidiaries.92\nIn general, cross-border strategic alliances are more complex and riskier than domestic \nstrategic alliances. For example, the level of corruption found in an alliance partner’s home \ncountry is a source of risk.93 Differences in the legal and institutional characteristics across \ncountries can also increase complexity and risk.94 As mentioned in Chapter 8, overcoming \nthe liabilities associated with cross-border strategic alliances requires that the two partners \ndevelop trust, which is even more difficult to achieve than in domestic alliances.95 Establishing \ntrust requires highly effective managers who can build trusting relationships with partners.96\nAll the strategies described in this book can fail. Cross-border alliances are no exception. \nAs described in the Strategic Focus, Ford and Mahindra formed a strategic alliance that was \nintended to allow the companies to combine their complementary capabilities in developing \nnew vehicles for the Indian market. Ford would gain Mahindra’s knowledge of designing and \nmanufacturing cars for emerging markets, and Mahindra would gain access to Ford’s tech-\nnological capabilities. Unfortunately, things did not work out as planned, and the alliance  \nis over.\nLearning Objective\n9-5 Understand why \nfirms use cross-border \nstrategic alliances as an \ninternational cooperative \nstrategy.\nA cross-border strategic \nalliance is a strategy \nin which firms with \nheadquarters in different \ncountries decide to combine \nsome of their resources \nto create a competitive \nadvantage.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In fact, in 2018, Ford sold its one millionth car in India. All told, \nFord has invested almost $2 billion to build in India. In 2010, it began \nbuilding two new manufacturing plants in India to accommodate \ngrowth in that market over time. However, Ford’s sales in India were \ndisappointing, so it began to export cars made in its new plants. Ford \nis not alone in failing to navigate the Indian automobile market effec-\ntively; Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, and Volkswagen have all experi-\nenced problems in the Indian market.\nNonetheless, Ford remains committed to the Indian market and \ndecided to take a different approach. It developed an alliance with \nMahindra and Mahindra Ltd. of India to cooperate in the develop-\nment of specific vehicles for India and other emerging markets. They \nagreed to jointly develop a new SUV using an existing Mahindra \nplatform, share powertrains including engines and transmissions, \nand co-develop a new compact SUV and a new electric vehicle. The \nnew alliance was intended to provide Ford knowledge and exper-\ntise to better serve emerging markets, including India, and provide \nMahindra access to Ford’s technology. Mahindra would like to pene-\ntrate the U.S. vehicle markets. It is already third in the tractor market \nin the United States and is trying to break into the U.S. off-road vehicle \nand pickup truck markets as well.\nFord was extremely positive about the potential success of this alli-\nance. It expected the Indian auto market to grow 8–10 percent annu-\nally for the near future. Nonetheless, industry analysts were skeptical \npartly because of the challenges involved in cross-border alliances. The \ntwo companies had to overcome different corporate cultures and dif-\nferent processes and find ways to coordinate and collaborate. \nDeals such as this one must be approved by the Indian govern-\nment. In early 2020, the Competition Commission of India approved \nformation of the joint venture between Ford and Mahindra, as well as \nthe transfer of Ford’s Indian automotive business into the new venture. \nMahindra would own a 51 percent stake in the joint venture, while \nFord would own 49 percent. This model means that Mahindra would \nhave a controlling interest, and Ford would suspend all its independent \noperations in India. Around the same time, Mahindra announced that \nit was going to expand its engine capacity in a Ford plant in Chennai.\nGiven all the goodwill surrounding this venture, it was surprising \nthat in early 2021, Ford and Mahindra announced that they had \nended their joint activities on all their projects in India. Concerning \nwhat Ford would decide to do with Mahindra moving forward, a \nsource said: “The options could include working out a new relation-\nship with Mahindra or ending the relationship and related vehicles \ncompletely.” Mahindra, for its part, decided to renew its efforts to \nproduce sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and electric vehicles. The par-\nticulars of why the deal fell apart were not reported to the press. All \nwe know is that the breakup came as Ford was working on a new \nstrategy for India.\nSources: 2021, Ford and Mahindra to end collaboration on all project in India, FRPT \nAutomobile Snapshot, April 6: 9; 2021, Mahindra to focus on SUVs, electric after ending \nFord JV, FRPT Automobile Snapshot, January 5: 23–24; 2021, Ford freezes projects with \nMahindra amid strategy reassessment, FRPT Automobile Snapshot, February 23: 7–8; \n2020, Competition Commission of India gives nod to Ford-Mahindra joint venture, FRPT \nAutomobile Snapshot, February 18: 20–21; 2020, Mahindra to expand engine capacity in \nFord plant, FRPT Automobile Snapshot, February 18: 22–23; P.

Cisco uses \nalliances to drive its growth, differentiate itself from competitors, enter new businesses areas, and \ncreate competitive advantages.

Sometimes, several of the firms with which Cisco has formed individual alliances part-\nner together to form a network to achieve shared objectives.98\nDemonstrating the complexity of network cooperative strategies is the fact that Cisco also com-\npetes against several firms with whom it has formed cooperative agreements, including network \nstrategies. For example, Cisco and IBM compete against each other. However, Cisco and IBM also \ncollaborate such that IBM security works with Cisco’s security to deliver a more secure environ-\nment for their customers, better enabling operators and partner communities to reduce security \nthreats.99 Overall, coopetition between Cisco and IBM demonstrates how firms use network coop-\nerative strategies as a way of creating value for customers by offering many goods and services in \nmany geographic (domestic and international) markets.\nA network cooperative strategy is particularly effective when it is formed by geographically \nclustered firms, as in California’s Silicon Valley and Rome, Italy’s aerospace cluster.100 Fostering \neffective social relationships and interactions among partners while sharing their resources makes \nit more likely that a network cooperative strategy will be successful.101 Also important is having a \nproductive strategic center firm (we discuss strategic center firms in detail in Chapter 11). Firms \ninvolved in networks gain information and knowledge from multiple sources.102 In fact, research \nhas found that firms that are at the strategic center of a network are more likely to engage in inter-\nnational strategic alliances, which has the potential to expand the knowledge base found within the \nnetwork.103 Network firms can use these heterogeneous knowledge sets to produce more and better \ninnovation. As a result, firms involved in networks of alliances tend to be more innovative.104 Also, \nfirms often imitate the level of exploratory research their partners exhibit, which could be another \nreason that they are more innovative.105\nNonetheless, there are disadvantages to participating in networks. A firm can be locked into \nits partnerships, which could preclude the development of alliances with other firms. In certain \nnetwork configurations, such as a Japanese keiretsu, firms in a network are expected to help other \nfirms in that network whenever support is required. Although research evidence suggests that \nbeing a member of some (but not all) keiretsu can enhance performance, it is also possible that the \nburdens associated with membership can become a burden and negatively affect the member firm’s \nperformance over time.106\n9-6a Alliance Network Types\nAn important advantage of a network cooperative strategy is that firms gain access to their part-\nners’ other partners.107 Having access to multiple collaborations increases the likelihood that addi-\ntional competitive advantages will be formed as the set of shared resources expands.108 In turn, \nbeing able to develop new resources further stimulates product innovations that are critical to \nstrategic competitiveness in the global economy.\nThe set of strategic alliance partnerships that firms develop when using a network cooperative \nstrategy is called an alliance network.109 Companies’ alliance networks vary by industry character-\nistics. A stable alliance network is formed in mature industries where demand is relatively constant \nand predictable. Through a stable alliance network, firms try to extend their competitive advan-\ntages to other settings while continuing to profit from operations in their core, relatively mature \nindustry. Thus, stable networks are built primarily to exploit the economies (scale and/or scope) \nthat exist between the partners, such as in the airline and automobile industries.110\nDynamic alliance networks are used in industries characterized by frequent product innova-\ntions and short product life cycles.111 The industries in which Apple and IBM compete are examples \nof this situation. Apple and IBM each partner with a host of other firms to develop component \nparts that are critical to providing the products that are central to their success. Thus, a network \nof relationships among multiple companies is foundational to achieving the objectives Apple and \nIBM each seek.\nIn dynamic alliance networks, partners typically explore new ideas with the potential to lead \nto product innovations, entries to new markets, and the development of new markets. Research \nsuggests that firms that help to broker relationships between companies remain important network \nparticipants as these networks change.112 Often, large firms in industries such as software and phar-\nmaceuticals create networks of relationships with smaller entrepreneurial start-up firms in their \nsearch for innovation-based outcomes. Alternatively, smaller firms with fewer resources or firms \nin developing economies often seek alliance participation to enhance their competitive positions.113 \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In this way, the small firm better serves its \nclient without having to add an expensive group of patent lawyers to its staff.114 An important \noutcome for small firms successfully partnering with larger firms in an alliance network is the \ncredibility they build by being associated with their larger collaborators.115\n9-7 Competitive Risks with Cooperative Strategies\nStated simply, many cooperative strategies fail. In fact, evidence shows that two-thirds of cooper-\native strategies have serious problems in their first two years and as many as 50 percent of them \nfail. This failure rate suggests that even when the partnership has potential complementarities and \nsynergies, alliance success is elusive.116 Although failure is undesirable, it can be a valuable learning \nexperience. Firms should carefully study a cooperative strategy’s failure to gain insights about how \nto form and manage future cooperative arrangements.117 \nWe show prominent cooperative strategy risks in Figure 9.5. One risk is that the contract gov-\nerning the alliance is insufficient in addressing important issues as they arise. This risk can lead \na firm to act opportunistically (e.g., take advantage of the other firm) or in a way that its partner \nthinks is opportunistic.118 This sort of behavior leads to a breakdown of trust, which can damage \nthe alliance’s ability to achieve its objectives.119 BP PLC and OAO Rosneft developed a joint venture \nto explore Russia’s Arctic Ocean in search of oil. However, the investment value by minority part-\nners of this joint venture was driven down at one point by 50 percent over concern that the Russian \ngovernment, Rosneft’s dominant owner, would expropriate value from the deal.120 \nWhile opportunistic behaviors can surface when formal contracts fail to prevent them, they can \nalso occur when an alliance is based on a false perception of partner trustworthiness.121 Typically, \nan opportunistic firm wants to acquire as much of its partner’s tacit knowledge as it can.122 Full \nawareness of what a partner wants in a cooperative strategy reduces the likelihood that a firm will \nsuffer from another firm’s opportunistic actions.123\nSome cooperative strategies fail when it is discovered that a firm has misrepresented the \nresources it can bring to the partnership. This risk is more common when the partner’s contribu-\ntion is based on some of its intangible assets. Superior knowledge of local conditions is an example \nof an intangible asset that partners often fail to deliver. This type of risk suggests the importance \nof carefully selecting alliance partners. Some firms may guard against this risk by identifying other \npotential partners in case the original alliance is unsuccessful. Having “backup” suppliers available \nis a common approach used in supply chain alliances.124\nThe cooperative relationships in the form of nonequity strategic alliances that are being created \nbetween some large pharmaceutical companies and outsourcing firms is potentially an example of \nthe “misrepresentation of available resources” risk. Pharmaceutical companies are outsourcing the \nmonitoring of drug safety to firms claiming to have the requisite human capital skills needed to suc-\ncessfully complete various monitoring tasks. But critics of this approach argue that drug monitor-\ning is difficult, requiring deep experience as well as knowledge of biochemistry and pharmacology. \nLearning Objective\n9-7 Explain cooperative \nstrategies’ risks.\nFigure 9.5 Managing Competitive Risks in Cooperative Strategies\nCompetitive\nRisks\nRisk and\nAsset\nManagement\nApproaches\nDesired\nOutcome\n• Inadequate\n  contracts\n• Misrepresentation\n  of competencies\n• Partners fail to use\n  their complementary\n  resources\n• Holding alliance\n  partners’ speciﬁc\n  investments\n  hostage\n• Detailed\n   contracts\n   and monitoring\n• Developing\n   trusting\n   relationships\nCreating value\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Nonetheless, \none study found that approximately 66 percent of the companies outsourced at least some portion \nof their drug safety activities.125 Thus, pharmaceutical companies may need to carefully monitor \nthe quality of the human capital resource their partners provide to complete what appears to be \ncomplicated monitoring work.\nA firm’s failure to make available to its partners the resources (such as the most sophisticated \ntechnologies) that it committed to the cooperative strategy is a third risk. This particular risk sur-\nfaces most commonly when firms form an international cooperative strategy, especially in emerg-\ning economies.126 In these instances, different cultures and languages can cause misinterpretations \nof contractual terms or trust-based expectations.\nA final risk is that one firm may make investments that are specific to the alliance while its \npartner does not. For example, the firm might commit resources to develop manufacturing equip-\nment that can be used only to provide products associated with the alliance. If the partner isn’t \nalso making alliance-specific investments, the firm is at a relative disadvantage in terms of returns \nearned from the alliance compared with investments made to earn the returns.\n9-8 Approaches for Managing  \nCooperative Strategies\nAlthough they are difficult to manage, cooperative strategies are an important means of growth \nand enhanced firm performance. Because the ability to effectively manage cooperative strategies \nis unevenly distributed across organizations in general, assigning managerial responsibility for a \nfirm’s cooperative strategies to a high-level executive or to a dedicated team improves the likeli-\nhood that the strategies will be well managed.127 In turn, being able to successfully manage cooper-\native strategies can alone contribute significantly to a firm’s competitive advantage.128 \nFor all cooperative strategies, success is more likely when partners behave cooperatively, and \ncooperation requires the establishment of trusting relationships. Actively solving problems, being \ntrustworthy, and consistently pursuing ways to combine partners’ resources to create value are \nexamples of cooperative behavior known to contribute to alliance success.129 Those responsible for \nmanaging the firm’s cooperative strategies should take the actions necessary to coordinate activi-\nties, categorize knowledge learned from previous experiences, and make certain that what the firm \nknows about how to effectively form and use cooperative strategies is in the hands of the right \npeople at the right time.130 Firms must also learn how to manage both the tangible and intangible \nassets (such as knowledge) that are involved with a cooperative arrangement. Too often, partners \nconcentrate on managing tangible assets at the expense of taking action also to manage a coopera-\ntive relationship’s intangible assets.131\nCost minimization and opportunity maximization are the two primary approaches firms use to \nmanage cooperative strategies.132 In the cost-minimization approach, the firm develops formal contracts \nwith its partners. These contracts specify how the cooperative strategy is to be monitored and how part-\nner behavior is to be controlled. The joint venture between GM China and SAIC Motor Corp. is being \nmanaged largely through formal contractual relationships. The goal of the cost-minimization approach \nis to minimize the cooperative strategy’s cost and to prevent opportunistic behavior by a partner.\nMaximizing a partnership’s value-creating opportunities is the focus of the opportunity- \nmaximization approach. In this case, partners are prepared to take advantage of unexpected oppor-\ntunities to learn from each other and to explore additional marketplace possibilities. Less formal \ncontracts, with fewer constraints on partners’ behaviors, make it possible for partners to explore \nhow their resources can be shared in multiple value-creating ways.\nFirms can successfully use either approach to manage cooperative strategies. Ironically, con-\ntract creation and monitoring costs are greater with cost minimization because writing detailed \ncontracts and using extensive monitoring mechanisms is expensive, even though the approach is \nintended to reduce alliance costs. As mentioned in the previous section, a detailed contract and \nmonitoring system is one way to manage risks associated with cooperative strategies, but they also \noften preclude positive responses to new opportunities that surface to productively use each alli-\nance partner’s unique resources. Thus, formal contracts and extensive monitoring systems tend to \nstifle partners’ efforts to gain maximum value from their participation in a cooperative strategy.133 \nLearning Objective\n9-8 Describe two basic \napproaches used to \nmanage cooperative \nstrategies.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Trust in this context means that the mangers of the firms engaging \nin the cooperative behavior believe that the other firm will not do anything to exploit their firm’s \nvulnerabilities, even if it has an opportunity to do so.134 When partners trust each other, there is less \nneed to write detailed formal contracts to specify each firm’s alliance behaviors, and the cooperative \nrelationship tends to be more stable.135 On a relative basis, trust tends to be more difficult to estab-\nlish in international cooperative strategies than in domestic ones. Differences in trade policies, cul-\ntures, laws, and politics that are part of cross-border alliances account for the increased difficulty.\nResearch showing that trust between partners increases the likelihood of success when using \nalliances highlights the benefits of the opportunity-maximization approach to managing cooper-\native strategies.136 Trust may also be the most efficient way to influence alliance partners’ behav-\niors. Thus, firms known to be trustworthy can have a competitive advantage in terms of how they \ndevelop and use cooperative strategies. Increasing the importance of trust in alliances is the fact \nthat it is not possible to specify all operational details of a cooperative strategy in a formal contract. \nAs such, being confident that its partner can be trusted reduces the firm’s concern about its inability \nto contractually control all alliance details.137\nSummary\n \n● A cooperative strategy is one in which firms work \ntogether to achieve a shared objective. Strategic alli-\nances, whereby firms combine some of their resources \nfor the purpose of creating a competitive advantage, \nare the primary form of cooperative strategies. Joint \nventures (whereby firms create a legally independent \ncompany that is jointly owned), equity strategic alli-\nances (in which firms buy shares in their partner com-\npanies), and nonequity strategic alliances (whereby \nfirms cooperate through a contractual relationship) \nare the three major types of strategic alliances. \nOutsourcing, discussed in Chapter 3, commonly occurs \nthrough nonequity strategic alliances.\n \n● Two of the most important reasons firms form strate-\ngic alliances are to create value they couldn’t generate \nby acting independently and to gain the full set of \nresources needed to pursue all identified opportuni-\nties to reach their objectives.\n \n● The reasons firms use strategic alliances vary by \nslow-cycle, fast-cycle, and standard-cycle market \nconditions. To enter restricted markets (slow cycle), \nto move quickly from one competitive advantage to \nanother (fast cycle), and to gain market power (stan-\ndard cycle) are among the reasons firms decide to use \nstrategic alliances.\n \n● Four business-level cooperative strategies are used to \nhelp the firm improve its performance in individual \nproduct markets:\n \n● Through vertical and horizontal complemen-\ntary alliances, companies combine some of their \nresources to create value in different parts (vertical) \nor the same parts (horizontal) of the value chain.\n \n● Competition response strategies are formed to \nrespond to competitors’ actions, especially strategic \nactions.\n \n● Uncertainty-reducing strategies are used to hedge \nagainst the risks created by the conditions of uncer-\ntain competitive environments (such as new prod-\nuct markets).\n \n● Competition-reducing strategies are used to avoid \nexcessive competition while the firm marshals its \nresources to improve its strategic competitiveness. \nExplicit and implicit collusion are both competition- \nreducing strategies. Mutual forbearance is a form \nof tacit collusion in which firms do not take com-\npetitive actions against rivals they meet in multiple \nmarkets.\nComplementary alliances have the highest probability \nof helping a firm to create a competitive advantage;  \ncompetition-reducing alliances have the lowest probability.\n \n● Firms use corporate-level cooperative strategies to \nengage in product and/or geographic diversification. \nThrough diversifying strategic alliances, firms agree to \nshare some of their resources to enter new markets \nor provide new products. Synergistic alliances are \nones in which firms share some of their resources to \ndevelop economies of scope. Synergistic alliances are \nlike business-level horizontal complementary alliances \nwhereby firms try to develop operational synergy, \nexcept that synergistic alliances are used to develop \nsynergy at the corporate level. Franchising is a corporate- \nlevel cooperative strategy in which the franchisor uses \na franchise as a contractual relationship to specify how \nresources will be shared with franchisees.\n \n● As an international cooperative strategy, a cross-border \nstrategic alliance is used for several reasons, including \nthe performance superiority of firms competing in mar-\nkets outside their domestic market and governmental \nrestrictions on a firm’s efforts to grow through mergers \nand acquisitions.

A firm’s opportunity to gain access “to its partner’s \nother partnerships” is a primary benefit of a network \ncooperative strategy.

In mature industries, stable \nnetworks are used to extend competitive advantages \ninto new areas. In rapidly changing environments \nwhere frequent product innovations occur, dynamic \nnetworks are used primarily as a tool of innovation.\n \n● Cooperative strategies often carry risk. If a contract is \nnot developed appropriately, or if a partner misrep-\nresents its resources or fails to make them available, \nfailure is likely. Furthermore, a firm may be held hos-\ntage through asset-specific investments made in con-\njunction with a partner, which may then be exploited.\n \n● Trust is an increasingly important aspect of success-\nful cooperative strategies. Firms place high value on \nopportunities to partner with companies known for \ntheir trustworthiness. When trust exists, a coopera-\ntive strategy is managed to maximize the pursuit of \nopportunities between partners. Without trust, for-\nmal contracts and extensive monitoring systems are \nused to manage cooperative strategies. In this case, \nthe interest is “cost minimization” rather than “oppor-\ntunity maximization.”\nKey Terms\nbusiness-level cooperative strategy 228\ncomplementary strategic alliances 228\ncooperative strategy 224\ncoopetition 230\ncorporate-level cooperative strategy 233\ncross-border strategic alliance 235\ndiversifying strategic alliance 233\nequity strategic alliance 225\nfranchising 234\njoint venture 225\nnetwork cooperative strategy 236\nnonequity strategic alliance 225\nstrategic alliance 224\nsynergistic strategic alliance 233\nReview Questions\n1.

Earlier in this chapter, we dis-\ncussed a much different type of partnership that included a \nunit of Accenture (Rothco), Warner Music, and Apple to help \nchildren with speech disorders. This venture with Microsoft \nwas formed to combine strategy and technology to help cli-\nents improve their information technology (IT) capabilities, \nand thus improve their business performance. Avanade now \nhas more than 50,000 employees around the world and thou-\nsands of clients, including many Fortune 500 companies. \nIn early 2019, Avanade, working with Accenture and \nMicrosoft, launched the Accenture Microsoft Business \nGroup. This new group expanded combined service capa-\nbilities on a global level to help clients overcome disruptions \ncaused by digital technologies and assume positions of lead-\nership in their industries. Specifically, the group is focused \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

In 2022, Shawn Simmons, vice \npresident of North America Engineering Hubs at Avanade, \nexplained his company’s decision to open an engineering hub \nin Tampa, Florida, as follows: “As our clients seek solutions \nfor adapting to the accelerated pace of change in a new, hybrid \nworld, it’s imperative we continue to enhance our team with \nthe best and brightest, forward-thinking talent. Watching \nTampa emerge as one of the nation’s hottest tech cities, we \nfelt in made sense for us to plant our flag here and become an \nactive part of this burgeoning community.” Avanade expects \nto hire hundreds of employees in Tampa over the next  \nthree years.\nWhy has Avanade been so successful? For one thing, \nthe company seamlessly integrates learning and develop-\nment into its business strategy. Also, in 2021, the company \nwas recognized by Newsweek, in collaboration with the \nBest Practice Institute, as a Most Loved Workplace. This \nlist is made up of only 100 companies, so this recognition is \nindeed significant. Pamela Maynard, CEO of Avanade, wants \nto foster a culture at Avanade “where everyone is welcome \nto bring their authentic selves to work and where diverse \nperspectives, backgrounds and skills are value as critical  \ndifferentiators in our ability to serve our clients.” The word \n“love” is not used a lot in business, but Maynard has no prob-\nlem using it: “When our people feel loved, when they feel a \nsense of purpose, when they feel they can be authentic and \nthey belong, there’s nothing—I truly believe there is nothing—\nthat we can’t accomplish as a business.”\nWhen asked how to create a Most Loved Workplace, \nMaynard cited three things. The first was: “Unite your orga-\nnization around a common objective.” Maynard said her \nemployees wanted to know that they were having a posi-\ntive impact on the world, so Avanade made this idea their \npurpose. Second was to “Create a culture of innovation.” \nOne thing Avanade does is run a global innovation contest \nfor employees, companies, and research centers. Also, “geek \nallowances” are provided to employees so they can stay cur-\nrent on the latest technologies. The third is: “Diversity and \ninclusion.” To achieve this objective, the company focuses \non its hiring process. Avanade also hired a chief diversity \nand inclusion officer, who runs leadership and development \nprograms.\nSources: L.

What are the resources each of the companies in this \njoint venture brought to the creation of Avanade? \nWere these resources complementary or redundant?\n2. What have you learned in this chapter and previous \nchapters about what was taking place in the external \nenvironment (i.e., technological, social, global) that \ncontributed to the success of this joint venture?\n3. Why does the work environment and culture fostered \nin Avanade fit particularly well with the type of work \nthe company does? Creating this sort of work environ-\nment is costly—do you suppose it would be worth it \nto invest so much into the internal work environment \nin all types of businesses? Why or why not?\n4. Microsoft and Accenture presumably invested a lot of \ntime, talent, money, and other resources into their ven-\nture over the years. What do you suppose Microsoft has \nreceived from these investments in addition to the prof-\nits the firm makes? What has Accenture received?\nNotes\n1. L. Cabral & G.

With 55,000 employees, its \nmore than 1,000 stores sell a variety of domestic merchandise, as well as health \nand beauty products, under the brand names that include Bed Bath & Beyond, \nHarmon Face Values, and buybuy Baby. In May 2021, the company announced a \nnew venture called Simply Essential that would sell privately labeled brands at \nlow prices. \nWhen the company was launched in the early 1970s, “big-box” stores specializing \nin a particular type of merchandise were becoming increasingly popular. In the mid-\n1980s, Bed Bath & Beyond opened its first superstore. The company grew rapidly after \nthat time. However, as has happened with a lot of traditional “brick-and-mortar” re-\ntailers, Bed Bath & Beyond began to suffer from increased competition from Walmart \nand Target, as well as a wide variety of Internet providers of domestic merchandise. \nThe company \nhas performed \npoorly on the \nInternet relative \nto competitors.\nBed Bath \n& Beyond’s \nproblems led to \npoor financial \nperformance, \nincluding steady \ndeclines in sales \nand net income. \nTotal revenue \nwas $12.3 billion \nin the fiscal year \nending March 3, \n2018, with net \nincome of $425 \nmillion. Since \nthen, revenue \nhas declined \nevery year, all the way down to $7.9 billion in the fiscal year ending on February 26, \n2022, according to a press release. This revenue was associated with a net loss of \n$559.6 million.\nAs a result of poor performance, activist investors have pushed for changes in gov-\nernance at Bed Bath & Beyond. Shareholder activism refers to actions shareholders \ntake to pressure top managers to amend corporate policies and practices that are \nmore to their liking. In this case, activists have focused on changes in top manage-\nment and in the board, as well as some new policies regarding governance in the \nfirm. For example, in March 2019, three activist investment firms—Ancora Advisors, \nMarcellum Advisors, and Legion Partners—joined forces to oust CEO Steven Temares. \nThey had an approximate 5 percent stake in the company at the time. Their pressure \nalso led to the resignation of five directors and a smaller board. Later that year,  \nMark Tritton, who was previously chief merchandising officer at Target, was  \nappointed CEO. \nIn 2020, Bed Bath & Beyond “announced a strategic restructuring program as part \nof the next phase of its work to rebuild the foundation of the business and create a \nsustainable, durable business model. The restructuring program includes a reor-\nganization and simplification of its field operations, significant reduction in man-\nagement positions across the business, and outsourcing of several functions.” As a \npart of the reorganization, the company laid off approximately 500 employees. The \nprogram was intended to dramatically reduce operating expenses. The company \nalso developed initiatives to improve the customer experience and increase sales.\nDespite these efforts, as described above, financial performance continued to  \ndecline. Then, in early 2022, another activist investor made a bold move. Ryan Co-\nhen’s firm, RC Ventures, acquired almost a 10 percent stake in Bed Bath & Beyond.  \nJHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com\n© anilakkus / Getty Images\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Bed Bath & Beyond agreed \nto add three new directors to the board, selected by RC Ventures. Two of these new directors—\nMarjorie Bowen and Ben Rosenzweig—would join “a four-member strategy committee to \nexplore alternatives to unlock greater value from the buybuy Baby business, which sells, baby \ngear, furniture, clothes, and more.” The other two members of the committee were existing \nindependent (non-company affiliated) directors Sue Gove and Andrea Weiss. Both a spin-off \nand a sale of buybuy Baby were among the potential alternatives. \nMr. Cohen, the billionaire cofounder of Chewy Inc., an online pet products company, is \nalso known for his investor activism at GameStop in 2020, picking up a board seat at the \ncompany and urging improvement in the company’s ecommerce business and exploration of \nother technologically driven opportunities. Perhaps his influence will have a positive impact \non turning the company around. Only time will tell us if this is the case; however, Wall Street \ninvestors seem fairly positive. Bed Bath & Beyond’s share price increased by 34 percent on the \nday it was announced that RC Ventures had acquired a large stake in the company.\nSources: J.

Because it is comprehensive in scope and complex \nin nature, corporate governance is a responsibility that challenges firms and their leaders. Evidence \nsuggests that corporate governance is critical to firms’ success, and dealing appropriately with this \nchallenge is important. Because of this, governance is an increasingly important part of the strate-\ngic management process.1\nCorporate governance is the set of mechanisms used to manage the relationships among stake-\nholders and to determine and control the strategic direction and performance of organizations.2 At \nits core, corporate governance is concerned with identifying ways to ensure that decisions (especially \nstrategic decisions) are made effectively and that they facilitate a firm’s efforts to achieve strategic \ncompetitiveness.3 Governance can also be thought of as a means to establish and maintain harmony \nbetween parties (the firm’s owners and its top-level managers) whose interests may conflict.\nIn modern corporations—especially those in nations with “Westernized” infrastructures and \nbusiness practices such as in the United States and the United Kingdom—ensuring that top-level \nmanagers’ interests are aligned with other stakeholders’ interests, particularly those of sharehold-\ners, is a primary objective of corporate governance. Processes used to elect members of the firm’s \nboard of directors, the general management of CEO pay and more focused supervision of director \npay, and the corporation’s overall strategic direction are examples of areas in which oversight is \nsought.4 Because corporate governance is an ongoing process concerned with how a firm is to be \nmanaged, its nature evolves in light of the types of never-ending changes in a firm’s external envi-\nronment that we discussed in Chapter 2.\nThe recent global emphasis on corporate governance stems mainly from the apparent fail-\nure of corporate governance mechanisms to adequately monitor and control top-level managers’ \ndecisions (as exemplified by the growing focus on governance issues among activist investors, as \ndiscussed in the Opening Case). In turn, undesired or unacceptable consequences resulting from \nusing corporate governance mechanisms cause changes such as electing new members to the board \nof directors with the hope of providing more effective governance. A second and more positive \nreason for this interest comes from evidence that a well-functioning corporate governance system \ncan create a competitive advantage for an individual firm.5\nLearning Objective \n10-1 Define corporate \ngovernance and explain \nhow it is used to monitor \nand control top-level \nmanagers’ decisions. \nCorporate governance is \nthe set of mechanisms used \nto manage the relationships \namong stakeholders and \nto determine and control \nthe strategic direction and \nperformance of organizations.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.\n\nChapter 10: Corporate Governance\n251\nIn the chapter’s first section, we describe the relationship on which the modern corporation \nis built—namely, the relationship between owners and managers. We use most of the chapter to \nexplain various mechanisms owners use to govern managers and to ensure that they comply with \ntheir responsibility to satisfy stakeholders’ needs, especially those of shareholders.\nThree internal and three external governance mechanisms are most relevant to the modern \ncorporation.6 The three internal governance mechanisms described in this chapter are owner-\nship concentration, represented by types of shareholders and their different incentives to monitor \nmanagers; the board of directors; and executive compensation. We then consider three external \ngovernance mechanisms: the market for corporate control, regulators, and creditors. The market \nfor corporate control is essentially a set of potential owners seeking to acquire undervalued firms \nand earn above-average returns on their investments by replacing ineffective top-level manage-\nment teams.7 \nThe chapter’s focus then shifts to the issue of international corporate governance. We briefly \ndescribe governance approaches used in several countries outside of the United States and \nUnited Kingdom. In part, this discussion suggests that the structures used to govern global com-\npanies competing in both developed and emerging economies are becoming more, rather than \nless, similar. Closing our analysis of corporate governance is a consideration of the need for \nthese control mechanisms to encourage and support ethical and socially responsible behavior in \norganizations.\n10-2 Separation of Ownership  \nand Managerial Control\nHistorically, U.S. firms were managed by founder-owners and their descendants. In these cases, \ncorporate ownership and control resided with the same group of people. As firms grew larger, “the \nmanagerial revolution led to a separation of ownership and control in most large corporations, \nwhere control of the firm shifted from entrepreneurs to professional managers while ownership \nbecame dispersed among thousands of unorganized stockholders who were removed from the \nday-to-day management of the firm.”8 These changes created the modern public corporation, \nwhich is based on the efficient separation of ownership and managerial control. \nThe separation of ownership and managerial control allows shareholders to purchase stock, \nwhich entitles them to income (residual returns) from the firm’s operations after paying expenses. \nThis right, however, requires that shareholders take a risk that the firm’s expenses may exceed its \nrevenues. To manage this investment risk, shareholders maintain a diversified portfolio by invest-\ning in several companies to reduce their overall risk.9 The poor performance or failure of any one \nfirm in which they invest has less overall effect on the value of the entire portfolio of investments. \nThus, shareholders specialize in managing their investment risk.\nCommonly, those managing small firms also own a significant percentage of the firm. In such \ninstances, there is less separation between ownership and managerial control. Moreover, in numerous \nfamily-owned firms, ownership and managerial control are not separated to any significant extent. \nResearch shows that family-owned firms perform better when a member of the family is the CEO \nrather than when the CEO is an outsider.10 In fact, if an outsider serves as CEO and is then replaced \nby a family CEO, performance tends to increase dramatically, especially in stable industries.11\nIn many regions outside the United States, such as in Latin America, Asia, and some Euro-\npean countries, family-owned firms dominate the competitive landscape.12 The primary purpose \nof most of these firms is to increase the family’s wealth, which explains why a family CEO often is \nbetter than an outside CEO. Still, family ownership remains significant in U.S. companies as well—\nmany of the largest U.S.-based companies have substantial family ownership.13\nFamily-controlled firms face at least two critical issues related to corporate governance. First, \nas they grow, they may not have access to all the skills needed to effectively manage the firm and \nmaximize returns for the family. Thus, outsiders may be required to facilitate growth. Second, as \nthey grow, they may need to seek outside capital and thus give up some of the ownership.

Research suggests that firms in which fam-\nilies own enough equity to have influence without major control tend to make the best strategic \ndecisions.15\nWithout owner (shareholder) specialization in risk bearing and management specialization in \ndecision making, a firm may be limited by its owners’ abilities to simultaneously manage it and \nmake effective strategic decisions relative to risk. Thus, the separation and specialization of owner-\nship (risk bearing) and managerial control (decision making) should produce the highest returns \nfor the firm’s owners. \n10-3 Agency Relationships and Agency Costs\nThe separation between owners and managers creates an agency relationship. An agency \nrelationship exists when one or more persons (the principal or principals) hire another person or \npersons (the agent or agents) as decision-making specialists to perform a service.16 Thus, an agency \nrelationship means that one party delegates decision-making responsibility to a second party for \ncompensation (see Figure 10.1). This sort of relationship exists between the shareholders (princi-\npals) and top-level managers (agents) of a public company.\nIn addition to shareholders and top-level managers, other examples of agency relationships are \ntop managers who hire subsidiary managers, client firms engaging consultants, and the insured \ncontracting with an insurer. Moreover, an agency relationship exists between managers and their \nemployees, as well as other stakeholders.17 However, in this chapter, we focus on the agency rela-\ntionship between the firm’s owners (i.e., shareholders) and top-level managers because these man-\nagers are responsible for formulating and implementing the firm’s strategies, which have major \neffects on firm performance.18\nThe separation between ownership and managerial control can be problematic. Research evi-\ndence documents a variety of agency problems in the modern corporation.19 Problems can surface \nbecause the principal and the agent have different interests and goals or because shareholders lack \ndirect control of large publicly traded corporations. Problems also surface when an agent makes \ndecisions that result in pursuing goals that conflict with those of the principals. Thus, the sep-\naration of ownership and control potentially allows divergent interests (between principals and \nagents) to occur, which can lead to managerial opportunism.\nManagerial opportunism is the seeking of self-interest with guile (i.e., cunning or deceit).20 \nOpportunism is both an attitude (i.e., an inclination) and a set of behaviors (i.e., specific acts of \nself-interest).21 Principals do not know beforehand which agents will or will not act opportunisti-\ncally. A top-level manager’s reputation is an imperfect predictor; moreover, opportunistic behavior \nLearning Objective\n10-3 Define an agency \nrelationship and \nmanagerial opportunism \nand describe their \nstrategic implications. \nAn agency relationship \nexists when one or more \npersons (the principal or \nprincipals) hire another \nperson or persons (the agent \nor agents) as decision-making \nspecialists to perform a \nservice.\nManagerial opportunism \nis the seeking of self-interest \nwith guile (i.e., cunning or \ndeceit).\nShareholders (Principals)\n•  Owners\nManagers (Agents)\n•  Decision makers\nhire\nand create\n•  Risk-bearing specialist (principal)\n    paying compensation to\n•  A managerial decision-making\n  specialist (agent)\nAn Agency Relationship\nFigure 10.1 An Agency Relationship\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Thus, principals establish governance and control mech-\nanisms to prevent agents from acting opportunistically, even though only a few are likely to do so. \nInterestingly, research suggests that when CEOs feel constrained by governance mechanisms, they \nare more likely to seek external advice that, in turn, helps them make better strategic decisions.22\nThe agency relationship suggests that any time principals delegate decision-making responsi-\nbilities to agents, the opportunity for conflicts of interest exists.23 Top-level managers, for example, \nmay make strategic decisions that maximize their personal welfare and minimize their personal \nrisk.24 Decisions such as these prevent maximizing shareholder wealth. As discussed in the Strate-\ngic Focus, decisions regarding product diversification demonstrate this situation.\nIn general, shareholders prefer riskier strategies that are likely to bring higher returns as well \nas more focused diversification. Shareholders can then reduce their risk by holding a diversified \nportfolio of investments. Alternatively, managers cannot balance their employment risk by working \nfor a diverse portfolio of firms; therefore, as mentioned in the strategic focus, managers may prefer \na level of diversification that maximizes firm size and their compensation while also reducing their \nemployment risk. Finding the appropriate level of diversification is difficult for managers. Research \nhas shown that too much diversification can have negative effects on the firm’s ability to create \nProduct Diversification as an Example of an Agency Problem\nAs explained in Chapter 6, a corporate-level strategy to diversify the \nfirm’s product lines can enhance a firm’s strategic competitiveness \nand increase its returns, both of which serve the interests of all stake-\nholders and certainly shareholders and top-level managers. However, \nproduct diversification can create two benefits for top-level managers \nthat shareholders do not enjoy, meaning that they may prefer prod-\nuct diversification more than shareholders do.\nOne reason managers prefer more diversification compared to \nshareholders is the fact that it usually increases the size of a firm and \nsize is positively related to executive compensation. Diversification \nalso increases the complexity of managing a firm and its network of \nbusinesses, possibly requiring additional managerial pay because of \nthis complexity. Thus, increased product diversification provides an \nopportunity for top-level managers to increase their compensation.\nThe second potential benefit is that product diversification and \nthe resulting diversification of the firm’s portfolio of businesses \ncan reduce top-level managers’ employment risk. As discussed in \nChapter 6, managerial employment risk is the risk of job loss, loss \nof compensation, and loss of managerial reputation. These risks are \nreduced with increased diversification because a firm and its upper-\nlevel managers are less vulnerable to the reduction in demand asso-\nciated with a single or limited number of product lines or businesses. \nFree cash flow can further incentivize top-level managers to \nengage in more diversification. Calculated as operating cash flow \nminus capital expenditures, free cash flow represents the cash \nremaining after the firm has invested in all projects that have positive \nnet present value within its current businesses. Top-level managers \nmay decide to diversify by investing free cash flow in products that \nare not associated with the firm’s current lines of business. \nWhenever managers use free cash flow to diversify the firm in \nways that do not have a strong possibility of creating additional value \nfor shareholders, the firm can become overdiversified, which reduces \nvalue for the shareholders and other stakeholders. Overdiversification \nis an example of self-serving and opportunistic managerial behavior. \nGeneral Electric is one example of a firm that became overdiversified. \nAs mentioned in Chapter 6, in late 2021, General Electric announced \nplans to split into three separate companies. \nSources: T.

Alternatively, diversification that \nstrategically fits the firm’s capabilities can enhance its innovation output.25 Product diversification, \ntherefore, can create a potential agency problem.\nThe potential conflict between shareholders and top-level managers, coupled with the fact \nthat principals cannot easily predict which managers might act opportunistically, demonstrates \nwhy principals establish governance mechanisms. However, the firm incurs costs when it uses \none or more governance mechanisms. Agency costs are the sum of incentive costs, monitoring \ncosts, enforcement costs, and individual financial losses incurred by principals because governance \nmechanisms cannot guarantee total compliance by the agent. Because monitoring activities within \na firm is difficult, the principals’ agency costs are larger in diversified firms given the additional \ncomplexity of diversification.26\nIn general, managerial interests may prevail when governance mechanisms are weak and there-\nfore ineffective, such as in situations where managers have a significant amount of autonomy to \nmake strategic decisions. If, however, the board of directors controls managerial autonomy, or if \nother strong governance mechanisms are used, the firm’s strategies should better reflect stakehold-\ners and certainly shareholders’ interests.27 \nNext, we explain the effects of the three internal governance mechanisms on managerial deci-\nsions regarding the firm’s strategies: ownership concentration, the board of directors, and executive \ncompensation. This will be followed by a discussion of the three external governance mechanisms: \nthe market for corporate control, regulators, and creditors. The six primary governance mecha-\nnisms are illustrated in Figure 10.2. Of course, in addition to these primary mechanisms, other \nstakeholders such as customers, communities, the media, alliance partners, and NGOs, among \nothers, can also influence the way a firm is governed, although the influence is not as direct.28\n10-4 Ownership Concentration\nOwnership concentration is defined by the number of large-block shareholders and the total per-\ncentage of the firm’s shares they own.29 Large-block shareholders typically own at least 5 percent \nof a company’s issued shares. Ownership concentration as a governance mechanism has received \nconsiderable interest because large-block shareholders are increasingly active in their demands \nthat firms adopt effective governance mechanisms to control managerial decisions so that they will \nbest represent owners’ interests.30 In recent years, the number of individuals who are large-block \nshareholders has declined. Institutional owners have become more prevalent than individuals as \nlarge-block shareholders. \nIn general, diffuse ownership (numerous shareholders with small holdings and few, if any, large-\nblock shareholders) produces weak monitoring of managers’ decisions. One reason for this weak \nmonitoring is that diffuse ownership makes it difficult for owners to effectively coordinate their \nactions. Ownership concentration influences decisions made about the strategies a firm will use.31 \nHigher levels of monitoring by large-block shareholders can encourage managers to avoid strategic \nAgency costs are the sum \nof incentive costs, monitoring \ncosts, enforcement costs, \nand individual financial \nlosses incurred by principals \nbecause governance \nmechanisms cannot \nguarantee total compliance \nby the agent.\nLearning Objective\n10-4 Explain the \nuse of three internal \ngovernance mechanisms \nto monitor and control \nmanagers’ decisions. \nOwnership concentration \nis defined by the number of \nlarge-block shareholders and \nthe total percentage of the \nfirm’s shares they own.\nLarge-block shareholders \ntypically own at least 5 percent \nof a company’s issued shares.\nRegulators\nCreditors\nMarket for Corporate\nControl\nThe Firm\nInternal Governance\nMechanisms\nOwnership\nConcentration\n•\nBoard of\nDirectors\n•\nExecutive\nCompensation\n•\nFigure 10.2 Primary Corporate Governance Mechanisms\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In \ngeneral, ownership concentration’s influence on strategies and firm performance is positive.33 \nThere is, however, another side to high levels of ownership concentration. When large-block \nshareholders have a high degree of wealth, they have power relative to minority shareholders to \nappropriate the firm’s wealth; this is particularly the case when they are in managerial positions. \nExcessive appropriation at the expense of minority shareholders is fairly common in emerging \neconomy countries, where minority shareholder rights often are not as protected as they are in the \nUnited States. In fact, in some of these countries, state ownership of an equity stake (even minority \nownership) can be used to control these potential problems.34 \nThe importance of boards of directors to prevent excessive appropriation of minority share-\nholder value has been found in firms with strong family ownership, where family members have \nincentives to appropriate shareholder wealth, especially in the second generation after the founder \nhas departed.35 Nonetheless, family-controlled businesses still tend to outperform nonfamily- \ncontrolled businesses, especially smaller and private firms, because of the importance of enhancing \nthe family’s wealth and maintaining the family legacy.36\n10-4a The Increasing Influence of Institutional  \nOwners and Activist Investors\nA classic work published in the 1930s argued that a separation of ownership and control had come \nto characterize the “modern” corporation.37 This change occurred primarily because growth pre-\nvented founders–owners from maintaining their dual positions in what were increasingly complex \ncompanies. More recently, another shift has occurred: Ownership of many modern corporations \nis now concentrated in the hands of institutional investors rather than individual shareholders. In \nfact, institutional owners now account for approximately 80 percent of the equity market in the \nUnited States.38\nInstitutional owners are financial institutions, such as mutual funds and pension funds, that \ncontrol large-block shareholder positions. Because of their prominent ownership positions, insti-\ntutional owners, as large-block shareholders, have the potential to be a powerful governance mech-\nanism. Estimates of the amount of equity in U.S. firms held by institutional owners range from 60 \nto 75 percent. In particular, pension funds are critical drivers of growth and economic activity in \nthe United States because they are one of the most significant sources of long-term, patient capi-\ntal.39 Patient capital comes from investors who are willing to invest over the long term rather than \nseeking immediate returns.40\nAs investors, institutional owners have both the size and the incentive to discipline ineffective \ntop-level managers and that they can significantly influence a firm’s choice of strategies and strate-\ngic decisions.41 As the Opening Case indicates, institutional and other large-block shareholders are \nbecoming more active in their efforts to influence a corporation’s strategic decisions. “Shareholder \nactivism refers to actions shareholders take with the intent of influencing corporate policy and \npractice.”42 Private activism occurs as powerful shareholders such as institutional investors or other \ntypes of large-block shareholders reach out to top managers through phone calls, meetings, letters, \nand dialogue to get them to change a policy or practice. If they own enough shares, they probably \nhold seats on the board of directors, which gives them easy access to top managers and other board \nmembers. If private activism fails, shareholder activists often engage in a variety of public activities \nsuch as media campaigns or publication of letters to force managers to comply with their wishes.43 \nInitially, shareholder activists and institutional investors concentrated on the performance and \naccountability of CEOs and contributed to the dismissal of several them. More recently, activists \nhave targeted the actions of boards more directly via proxy vote proposals that are intended to give \nshareholders more decision rights because they believe board processes have been ineffective.44 A \nrule approved by the SEC allowing large shareholders (owning 1 to 5 percent of a company’s stock) \nto nominate up to 25 percent of a company’s board of directors enhances shareholders’ decision \nrights.45\nSometimes activist investors join forces in what are called wolf packs.46 They are led by one of \nthe activists, often a hedge fund, with other activist investors engaging in peripheral activities. One \ninteresting aspect of a wolf pack is that they tend to be uncoordinated; that is, they do not create a \nformal coalition.47 Rather, individual activists ostensibly hear that a wolf pack is forming through \nInstitutional owners are \nfinancial institutions, such as \nmutual funds and pension \nfunds, that control large-block \nshareholder positions.\nShareholder activism \nrefers to actions shareholders \ntake with the intent of \ninfluencing corporate policy \nand practice.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

However, some evidence suggests that a certain amount of undisclosed coordination is taking \nplace.48 “Wolf packs increase the probability of activists successfully securing board representation \nand golden leash compensation structures help to facilitate a market for activist board members, \nwhere well-reputed directors are recruited to suitable board positions, improving the overall quality \nof activist strategy and potentially lengthening the time horizon of activist investments.”49 Golden \nleash compensation structures “incentivize activist appointed directors to increase the share price \nof target companies.”50\nTo date, research suggests that institutional activism may not have a strong direct effect on \nfirm performance, but it may indirectly influence a targeted firm’s strategic decisions, including \nthose concerned with social issues. In addition, activism can influence the behavior of firms that \nare not even direct targets of an institutional investor when that investor also owns stock in their \ncompany—the mere recognition that the institutional investor is going after a different company in \nits portfolio is enough to encourage them into making strategic changes.51 Thus, to some degree at \nleast, institutional activism has the potential to discipline managers and to enhance the likelihood \nof a firm taking future actions that are not only in shareholders’ best interests but also those of all \nstakeholders, including society at large.52\n10-4b Board of Directors\nShareholders elect the members of a firm’s board of directors. The board of directors is a group of \nelected individuals who oversee managers to ensure that the corporation operates in ways that will \nbest serve stakeholders’ interests.53 The board plays a “foundational role in strategic management” \nand can influence every aspect of the strategic planning process, “from setting strategic goals, to \nidentifying strategic alternatives, to communicating and legitimating the strategy with organiza-\ntional stakeholders, to monitoring and evaluating its success.”54 Helping board members reach \ntheir expected objectives are their powers to direct the affairs of the organization and reward and \ndiscipline top-level managers.\nUnfortunately, evidence suggests that some boards have not been particularly effective in mon-\nitoring and controlling top-level managers’ decisions and subsequent actions.55 Because of their \nrelatively ineffective performance, boards are experiencing increasing pressure from shareholders, \nlawmakers, and regulators to become more forceful in their oversight role to prevent top-level \nmanagers from acting in their own best interests. Moreover, in addition to their monitoring role, \nboard members increasingly are expected to provide resources to the firms they serve.56  These \nresources include their personal knowledge and expertise and their relationships with a wide vari-\nety of organizations.57 Research has shown that it is especially important to have board members \nwith expertise in areas that are most relevant to the types of risks the firm faces when making \nstrategic decisions.58\n10-4c Shareholders versus Stakeholders\nFor decades, a debate has been raging among scholars and business executives regarding whether \ntop managers and boards should give the shareholders of an organization a higher priority than \nother stakeholders (i.e., customers, employees) when making strategic decisions.59 In fact, many \ntop executives believe it is a legal responsibility to put shareholders first, although there is evi-\ndence that this is not the case.60 Whether giving shareholders top priority is a legal requirement or \nnot, doing so is a strong norm among top executives that is unlikely to disappear for a long time; \nhowever, there is definite movement in the direction of giving non-shareholder stakeholders more \nimportance in strategic decisions.61 After all, value is created through working with stakeholders, \nso neglecting them is likely to reduce the value created, even for the shareholders.62\nSocietal trends are among the most important forces that are moving top managers and boards \nin the direction of a more balanced view of the stakeholder-oriented responsibilities. The CSR \nmovement discussed in Chapters 1 and 2 means that investors, regulators, the press and social \nmedia, other stakeholders, and society at large are much more sensitive to how a firm treats its \nstakeholders. Also, “short-termism” associated with trying to maximize returns for sharehold-\ners has led to a loss of firm value over the longer term.63 “The single-minded pursuit of a short-\nterm value maximization ‘mantra’ by top managers often results in long-term value destruction \nfor shareholders.”64 For example, cutting an R&D program could increase short-term profits, but \nThe board of directors is a \ngroup of elected individuals \nwho oversee managers to \nensure that the corporation \noperates in ways that will best \nserve stakeholders’ interests.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

There is irony in this situation because as executives \npursue short-term profits and share prices increase, they probably feel as though they are serving \nshareholder interests well. Boards are responsible for ensuring that decisions are made that allow \nthe firm to prosper not just in the short term, but also in the long term. A broader stakeholder \norientation is more likely to lead to this sort of sustainable performance than an obsession with \nshareholder returns.65\nEvidence exists that top executives have adopted a more stakeholder-oriented approach. As \nmentioned in Chapter 1, nearly 200 CEOs from the largest corporations in the United States \nreleased a signed statement in 2019 through an association called the Business Roundtable declar-\ning that the purpose of the corporation is to serve the interests of employees, customers, suppliers, \ncommunities, and shareholders.66 Two features of this statement are particularly important. First, \nthere is no prioritization of stakeholders in this list. Second, this same group released a statement in \n1997 stating that the most important duty of top managers and boards is to shareholders. \nOther evidence that the tides of opinion are changing is found in the increasing popularity of \nbenefit corporations. A benefit corporation (sometimes known as a public-benefit corporation) is \nvery much like a traditional corporation regarding its legal and tax status; however, its approved \ncorporate bylaws state that it is a benefit corporation and that its top managers and directors must \nconsider other public benefits besides profits.67 Examples include Patagonia, King Arthur Flour, \nand Kickstarter. Benefit corporations also have a much higher level of transparency than other \ncorporations and publish benefit reports that outline their social and environmental performance. \nMost U.S. states have authorized benefit corporations, and there are now over 3,000 benefit corpo-\nrations in the United States alone.68 In addition, organizations can seek B-Corp certification from a \nthird party such as B Lab. There are now over 5,000 companies in 80 countries and 154 industries \nthat are certified as B-Corps.69 Patagonia is both a benefit corporation and is B-Corp certified. \nOther examples of companies with this certification include the French fashion house Chloé and \nthe Polish company Netguru.70\n10-4d Types of Board Members\nGenerally, board members (often called directors) are classified into one of three groups (see \nTable 10.1). Insiders are active top-level managers in the company who are elected to the board \nbecause they are a source of information about the firm’s day-to-day operations.71 Related out-\nsiders have some relationship with the firm, contractual or otherwise, that may create questions \nabout their independence, but these individuals are not involved with the corporation’s day-to-day \nactivities. Outsiders provide independent counsel to the firm and may hold top-level managerial \npositions in other companies or may have been elected to the board prior to the beginning of the \ncurrent CEO’s tenure.72 Historically, inside managers dominated a firm’s board of directors; how-\never, this situation has changed to the point that outsiders now comprise the majority of board \nmembers, at least in the United States.73\nA widely accepted view is that a board with a significant percentage of its membership from \nthe firm’s top-level managers provides relatively weak monitoring and control of managerial deci-\nsions.74 With weak board monitoring, managers sometimes use their power to select and com-\npensate directors and exploit their personal ties with them. In response to the SEC’s proposal, in \n1984 the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) implemented a rule requiring outside directors to \nTable 10.1 Classification of Board of Directors’ Members\nInsiders\n \n●\nThe firm’s CEO and other top-level managers \nRelated outsiders\n \n●\nIndividuals not involved with the firm’s day-to-day operations, but who have a relationship  \nwith the company \nOutsiders\n \n●\nIndividuals who are independent of the firm in terms of day-to-day operations and other  \nrelationships\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Subsequently, after the U.S. government pass legislation called the  \nSarbanes-Oxley Act (to be discussed later in this chapter), other new rules required that indepen-\ndent outsider directors lead important committees such as the audit, compensation, and nomina-\ntion committees.75 Policies of the NYSE now require companies to maintain boards of directors \nthat are composed of a majority of outside independent directors and to maintain full independent \naudit committees. Thus, additional scrutiny of corporate governance practices is resulting in a sig-\nnificant amount of attention being devoted to finding ways to recruit quality independent directors \nand to encourage boards to take actions that fully represent shareholders’ best interests.76\nHaving outside directors is not always enough to resolve agency problems because a powerful \nCEO can strongly influence a board’s decisions.77 One proposal to reduce the power of the CEO is \nto separate the chair’s role and the CEO’s role on the board so that the same person does not hold \nboth positions.78 A situation in which an individual holds both the CEO and chair of the board title \nis called CEO duality.79 A CEO who also chairs the board is going to have even more power than a \nCEO who does not. Normally, this would be considered contrary to the interests of shareholders. \nHowever, in one interesting study, researchers found that CEO duality was associated with higher \nfirm performance during a time of high economic policy uncertainty, perhaps because the unifica-\ntion of the two roles of CEO and chairperson provided for more decisive leadership.80\nAlthough having numerous outside board members typically is seen as a good thing, it can also \ncreate some problems. For example, because outsiders typically do not have contact with the firm’s \nday-to-day operations and do not have ready access to detailed information about managers and \ntheir skills, they lack the insights required to fully and effectively evaluate their decisions and initia-\ntives, especially when they are busy serving on multiple boards.81 Because they work with and lead \nthe firm daily, insiders have access to information that facilitates forming and implementing appro-\npriate strategies. Accordingly, some evidence suggests that boards with a critical mass of insiders \ntypically are better informed about intended strategic initiatives, the reasons for the initiatives, and \nthe outcomes expected from pursuing them.82 Outsiders can at least partly overcome this informa-\ntion problem through frequent interactions with inside board members and through discussions \nduring board meetings to enhance their understanding of the firm’s managers and their decisions.\n10-4e Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors\nHaving a board that actively monitors top-level managers’ decisions and actions does not ensure \nhigh performance. Because of the importance of boards of directors in corporate governance, and \nbecause of increased scrutiny from shareholders—in particular, large institutional investors—the \nperformance of individual board members and of entire boards is being evaluated more formally \nand with greater intensity.83 The demand for greater accountability and improved performance is \nstimulating many boards to voluntarily make changes. Among these changes are:\n1. increases in the diversity of the backgrounds of board members (e.g., a greater number of \ndirectors from public service, academic, and scientific settings; a greater percentage of ethnic \nminorities and women; and members from different countries on boards of U.S. firms);\n2. the strengthening of internal management and accounting control systems;\n3. increased attention to issues of corporate social responsibility, especially sustainability and \nglobal warming;\n4. establishing and consistently using formal processes to evaluate board members’ performance;\n5. modifying the compensation of directors, especially reducing or eliminating stock options as \na part of their package; and\n6. creating the “lead director” role that has strong powers regarding the board agenda and over-\nsight of non-management board member activities.84\nDiversity—in particular diversity among board members in terms of functional backgrounds, \neducation, and experience—increases the quality of board involvement in decision making within \nthe firm.85 Recently, however, the focus has been more on including more women and minorities \non boards.86 Women hold only 19 percent of board seats and all minorities combined account for \njust over 10 percent, with African Americans accounting for the largest portion of minorities on \nboards.87 In response, some U.S. states are requiring minority representation on public boards.88 \nWe still don’t have sufficient research regarding the effect of this sort of diversity on strategy and \nperformance, but we do know that female and racial minority board members have a more difficult \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Especially when a firm is underperforming, diverse opinions and perspec-\ntives are most needed.\nAn increase in the board’s involvement with a firm’s strategic decision-making processes cre-\nates the need for effective collaboration between board members and top-level managers.90 Board \neffectiveness depends on improving processes used by boards to make decisions, provide counsel \nto managers, monitor managers, and assess firm outcomes. It is also important to pay attention \nto board structure, such as the size of the board and the formation of committees to handle vari-\nous tasks (i.e., compensation, auditing).91 For example, research has shown that more experienced \nboards have the potential to help high-tech ventures take advantage of opportunities; however, they \nare less likely to do so if the board is too large.92\nIncreasingly, outside directors are being required to own significant equity stakes as a prereq-\nuisite to holding a board seat. In fact, some research suggests that firms perform better if outside \ndirectors have such a stake—one study found that director stock ownership leads to better firm \nacquisition outcomes.93 However, other research suggests that too much ownership can lead to \nlower independence for board members.94 Although questions remain about whether more inde-\npendent and diverse boards enhance board effectiveness, the trends for greater independence and \nincreasing diversity among board members are likely to continue.\n10-5 Executive Compensation\nExecutive compensation is a governance mechanism that seeks to align the interests of managers \nand owners through salaries, bonuses, and long-term incentives such as stock awards and options. \nThe compensation of top-level managers, and especially of CEOs, generates a great deal of interest \nand strongly held opinions.95 Some believe that top-management team members, and certainly \nCEOs, have a great deal of responsibility for a firm’s performance and that they should be rewarded \naccordingly.96 CEO compensation can be used as a commitment device, based on their talent and \nexperience, so that they do not leave the firm.97 Also, a common argument, based on the economic \nforces of supply and demand, is that they should be paid comparably to their peer CEOs.98 On the \nother side of the argument, others conclude that top executives (and again, especially CEOs) are \ngreatly overpaid, that nobody deserves that much compensation, and that their compensation is \nnot as strongly related to firm performance as should be the case.99 \nFrom 2020 to 2021, the median compensation for U.S. CEOs increased 19 percent to $14.2 million \nfor executives of companies listed on the S&P 500. “At roughly $247 million, Discovery Inc.’s David \nZaslav had the highest salary disclosed so far, \nfollowed closely by Amazon’s Andy Jassy at \nnearly $213 million. Compensation figures for \nCEOs consist of salary, stock rewards and cash \nbonuses, the latter two of which were responsi-\nble for the bulk of CEOs’ pay increases, accord-\ning to a Fortune analysis of 2021 executive pay, \nconducted by Compensation Advisory Part-\nners (CAP).”100 To put things in perspective, \nZaslav’s pay was nearly 3,000 times the median \nsalary for other employees at Discovery and \nJassy’s salary was about 6,500 times the median \nsalary at Amazon.101\nBecause of oversized compensation pack-\nages, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act requires \nthat \npublic \ncompanies \ndisclose \ntheir \nCEO-to-median-employee pay ratio in their \nannual proxy statement. There are huge differ-\nences in this ratio even among companies in \nthe same industry. Along with Dodd-Frank, the \nLearning Objective\n10-5 Discuss the types \nof compensation top-\nlevel managers receive \nand their effects on \nmanagerial decisions. \nExecutive compensation \nis a governance mechanism \nthat seeks to align the \ninterests of managers and \nowners through salaries, \nbonuses, and long-term \nincentives such as stock \nawards and options.\nDavid Zaslav’s salary skyrocketed in 2021 after signing an extended contract with \nDiscovery as CEO through 2027.\nREUTERS/Alamy Stock Photo\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

One of the business units within \nthe advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services provides analyses of company performance \nand CEO compensation to help shareholders decide how to vote their shares at annual meetings.102 \nThis kind of scrutiny makes board members more accountable to shareholders. As such, board \nmembers can be disciplined and even lose board seats if the compensation plan receives a negative \nvote from shareholders. Also, shareholders can sometimes have a direct influence on CEO pay, as in \nthe case when General Electric CEO Larry Culp agreed to take a $10 million cut after shareholder \nprotested his compensation, arguing that GE’s performance was poor compared to the company’s \npeers.103\nAs an internal governance mechanism, executive compensation is complicated, for several rea-\nsons. First, the strategic decisions top-level managers make are complex and nonroutine, meaning \nthat direct supervision (even by the firm’s board of directors) is likely to be ineffective as a means \nof judging the quality of their decisions. The result is a tendency to link top-level managers’ com-\npensation to outcomes the board can easily evaluate, such as the firm’s financial performance. This \nleads to a second issue in that, typically, the effects of top-level managers’ decisions are stronger on \nthe firm’s long-term performance than its short-term performance. This reality makes it difficult \nto regularly assess the effects of top managers’ decisions (e.g., annually). Third, several other fac-\ntors affect a firm’s performance besides top-level managerial decisions and behavior. Unpredictable \nchanges in segments (economic, demographic, political/legal, etc.) in the firm’s general environ-\nment (see Chapter 2) make it difficult to separate the effects of top-level managers’ decisions and \nthe effects (both positive and negative) of changes in the firm’s external environment on the firm’s \nperformance.\nLong-term incentive plans (typically involving stock options and stock awards) are an import-\nant part of compensation packages for top-level managers, especially those leading U.S. firms. The-\noretically, using long-term incentives facilitates the firm’s efforts (through the board of directors’ \npay-related decisions) to avoid potential agency problems by linking managerial compensation to \nthe wealth of common shareholders.104 There is evidence that poor corporate governance can lead \nto the CEO taking a disproportionate share of the total managerial pay in an organization.105 How-\never, shareholders typically assume that top-level managers’ pay and the firm’s performance are \nmore properly aligned when outsiders are the dominant block of a board’s membership.106 \nEffectively using executive compensation as a governance mechanism is particularly challeng-\ning for firms implementing international strategies. For example, the interests of the owners of \nmultinational corporations may be best served by less uniformity in the firm’s foreign subsidiar-\nies’ compensation plans.107 Developing an array of unique compensation plans requires additional \nmonitoring, potentially increasing the firm’s agency costs. Importantly, pay levels vary by regions \nof the world. For example, managerial pay is highest in the United States and much lower in Asia. \nHistorically, compensation for top-level managers has been lower in India partly because many of \nthe largest firms have strong family ownership and control.108\n10-6 External Governance Mechanisms\nIn addition to the three internal governance mechanisms discussed previously, there are also three \nexternal governance mechanisms. These are forces outside the firm that have a strong influence \non top-level management decisions and actions. These mechanisms consist of what is called the \nmarket for corporate control as well as two powerful stakeholders—regulators and creditors.\n10-6a The Market for Corporate Control\nThe market for corporate control is an external governance mechanism that is active when a \nfirm’s internal governance mechanisms fail.109 The market for corporate control is composed of \nindividuals and firms that buy large-block shareholder positions in or purchase all of what they \nconsider undervalued corporations, with the intention of making changes to enhance their value. \nMentioned previously in Chapter 6, private equity firms, which amass large amounts of investment \ncapital from high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors (i.e., Blackstone, KKR & Co., \nCarlyle Group), are very active in this market.110 Because top-level managers are assumed to be \nLearning Objective\n10-6 Describe how the \nmarket for corporate \ncontrol, regulators, and \ncreditors restrain top-\nlevel managers’ decisions.\nThe market for corporate \ncontrol is an external \ngovernance mechanism that \nis active when a firm’s internal \ngovernance mechanisms fail.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This was a 51 percent premium over \nthe monthly average price for Twitter stock compared to its price \nbefore Mr. Musk expressed interest in buying the company earlier \nin the month. At the time of the letter, Musk owned over 9 percent \nof the stock. He had recently been very critical of management of \nTwitter, “especially its approach to content moderation, which he \nbelieves impedes free speech.” He described Twitter as the “de facto \ntown square,” and said that it is very important that there be “an \ninclusive arena for free speech.” In an ironic twist, he used his Twitter \naccount, with 82 million followers, to share his criticisms.\nThe letter followed a month of what might be called “dancing” \nwith Twitter. The company offered Mr. Musk a board seat, which \nwas “contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.” \nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced that Musk would be joining \nthe board, stating that he understood the risks of bringing Musk \nonto the board but thought it was the “best path forward” for the \ncompany. Then Musk turned down the invitation and signaled his \nintention to acquire the company instead. His intentions were com-\nplicated by defensive actions taken by the board. They launched \nwhat is known as a “poison pill” that allows other shareholders to \nbuy discounted stock in Tesla if Musk’s ownership exceeds 15 per-\ncent of the stock.\nA regulatory filing on April 14 included Mr. Musk’s letter to the \nTwitter chairman and said that the offer was nonbinding and depen-\ndent on his ability to raise the needed financing. By the end of April, \nthe financing was arranged, including $25 billion in loans from a \ngroup of banks that included Bank of American, Morgan Stanley, and \nBarclays, with one-third of his stake in Tesla as collateral for the loans. \nMusk would commit $21 billion of his own equity to the deal. In the \nnew filing, he also said he was willing to take the offer directly to the \nshareholders through a tender offer, which would bypass the board. \nIn a tender offer, the potential buyer offers to buy stock directly from \nthe shareholders. If they can acquire more than half the stock, then \nthey control the company.\nWith financing arranged, and the threat of a tender offer, Twitter \nexecutives decided to enter negotiations with Mr. Musk, and met with \nhim on April 24. Within two days an agreement was reached, with a \n$44 billion price tag. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s founder and former CEO, \napproved the purchase: “Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his \nmission to extend the light of consciousness.” \nMr. Musk’s agenda for Twitter is bold. He wants to soften Twitter’s \nstance on content moderation, using more caution before deciding \nto take down tweets or permanently ban users. He also wants the \ncompany to create an edit feature for tweets, make Twitter’s algo-\nrithm “open source” so that people outside the company can recom-\nmend fixes and changes, try to put a stop to both spam and scam \nbots, rely less on advertising, and allow longer tweets. According to \nMusk, “Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.”\nSources: C. Lombardo, M. Bobrowsky, & G.

An effective \nmarket for corporate control helps ensure that ineffective and/or opportunistic top-level managers \nare disciplined.111 \nBetween the 1940s and the 1980s, large-block activist shareholders, labeled “corporate raiders,” \nwere the most influential players in the market for corporate control.112 They would buy companies \nand often seek to increase the debt load, sell off business units, and downsize by laying off workers. \nIf a target firm did not respond as the raider required, they would compel the company to pay a \npremium by buying back the shares they bought, often called “greenmail.”113 \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

However, because of \ndefensive tactics (to be discussed in the next section), actual takeovers are not as common as they \nused to be.115 More often, activist investors use their stakes in companies as leverage to assume \nboard seats and influence management to make changes that conform to what they would like to \nsee done. Nonetheless, as we see in the Strategic Focus, takeovers (or threats of takeovers) are still \na meaningful part of external governance. In fact, activist investors often use their influence to \ncompel entrenched incumbent managers to sell.116 \nBecause of the disciplinary power of the market for corporate control, target firm managers and \nboard members are sensitive about takeover bids, since being a target suggests that they have been \nineffective in fulfilling their responsibilities. For top-level managers, a board’s decision to accept \nan acquiring firm’s offer typically finds them losing their jobs because the acquirer usually wants \ndifferent people to lead the firm. At the same time, rejection of an offer also increases the risk of \njob loss for top-level managers because the pressure from the board and shareholders for them to \nimprove the firm’s performance becomes substantial. As the Strategic Focus demonstrates, activist \ninvestors with significant funding from institutional investors are often the head of the spear when \nit comes to the market for corporate control. \nIn general, activist pension funds (as institutional investors and as an internal governance \nmechanism) are reactive in nature, taking actions when they conclude that a firm is underperform-\ning. In contrast, activist hedge funds (as part of the market for corporate control) are proactive; \nthey identify firms whose performance could be improved and then invest in them.117\nAnother possibility is suggested by research results—namely, that as a governance mechanism, \ninvestors sometimes use the market for corporate control to take an ownership position in firms \nthat are performing well.118 A study of active corporate raiders in the 1980s showed that takeover \nattempts often were focused on above-average-performance firms in an industry.119 This work and \nother recent research suggest that the market for corporate control is an imperfect governance \nmechanism.120 Actually, mergers and acquisitions are highly complex strategic actions with many \npurposes and potential outcomes. As discussed in Chapter 7, some are successful, and many are \nnot—even when they have potential to do well—because implementation challenges when inte-\ngrating two diverse firms can limit their ability to realize their potential.121\nIn summary, the market for corporate control is a blunt instrument for corporate governance; \nnonetheless, this governance mechanism does have the potential to represent shareholders’ best \ninterests. Accordingly, top-level managers want to lead their firms in ways that make disciplining \nby activists outside the company unnecessary and/or inappropriate. Top-level managers can use \nseveral defense tactics to fend off a takeover attempt. Managers leading a target firm that is per-\nforming well are almost certain to try to thwart the takeover attempt. Even in instances when the \ntarget firm is underperforming its peers, managers might use defense tactics to protect their own \ninterests. \n10-6b Managerial Defense Tactics\nIn most cases, hostile takeovers are the principal means by which the market for corporate con-\ntrol is activated. A hostile takeover is an acquisition of a target company that is unwanted by the \ncompany’s top executives and board of directors.122 Firms targeted for a hostile takeover may use \nmultiple defense tactics to fend off the takeover attempt. Increased use of the market for corporate \ncontrol has enhanced the sophistication and variety of managerial defense tactics that are used in \ntakeovers.123\nBecause the market for corporate control tends to increase risk for managers, one defensive \ntactic, called a golden parachute, results in a huge payment to the CEO and sometimes other top \nexecutives if the firm is taken over. Golden parachutes, similar to most other defense tactics, are \ncontroversial in that they are often seen as harming shareholder interests; they are an agency prob-\nlem. Another takeover defense strategy is traditionally known as a “poison pill,” which was high-\nlighted in the Strategic Focus. This strategy usually allows shareholders (other than the acquirer) \nto convert “shareholders’ rights” into numerous common shares at a huge discount if an individual \nor company acquires more than a set amount of the target firm’s stock (typically 10 to 20 percent). \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Some firms amend \nthe corporate charter so board member elections are staggered, resulting in only one third of mem-\nbers being up for reelection each year. Research shows that this results in reduced vulnerability to \nhostile takeovers but also provides for better long-term investments.124 Additional takeover defense \nstrategies are presented in Table 10.2.\nMost institutional investors oppose the use of defensive tactics because such defenses are gen-\nerally seen as a way to entrench top managers in their positions.125 Many institutional investors also \noppose severance packages (golden parachutes), and the opposition is increasing significantly in \nEurope as well.126 However, an advantage to severance packages is that they may encourage top-\nlevel managers to accept takeover bids with the potential to best serve shareholders’ interest.127 \nAlternatively, research results show that using takeover defenses reduces the amount of pressure \nmanagers feel to seek short-term performance gains, resulting in them concentrating on develop-\ning strategies with a longer time horizon and a high probability of serving stakeholders’ interests. \nSuch firms are more likely to invest in and develop innovation; when they do so, the firm’s market \nvalue increases, thereby rewarding shareholders.128\nAn awareness on the part of top-level managers about the existence of external investors in \nthe form of individuals (e.g., Elon Musk, Carl Icahn) and groups (e.g., hedge funds) often posi-\ntively influences them to align their interests with those of the firm’s stakeholders, especially the \nTable 10.2 Hostile Takeover Defense Strategies\nDefense strategy\nSuccess as \na strategy\nEffects on \nshareholder wealth\nCapital structure change: Dilution of the target firm’s stock, making it more costly for an \nacquiring firm to continue purchasing the target’s shares.

Moreover, when active as an external governance mechanism, the market for corpo-\nrate control has brought about significant changes in many firms’ strategies and, when used appro-\npriately, has served shareholders’ interests.129 Of course, the goal is to have the managers develop \nthe psychological ownership of principals.130 However, such sense of ownership can be taken too \nfar such that narcissistic (i.e., egotistical) top executives can feel that they are personally central to \nthe identity of the firm.131\n10-6c Regulators\nIn the recent past, observers of firms’ governance practices have been concerned about more \negregious behavior beyond mere ineffective corporate strategies, such as that discovered at Enron, \nWorldCom, and Volkswagen, and major financial institutions. Partly in response to these behav-\niors, the U.S. Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002 and passed the Dodd-Frank \nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) in mid-2010.\nBecause of these two acts, corporate governance mechanisms have received greater scrutiny.132 \nWhile the implementation of SOX has been controversial to some, most believe that its use has \nled to generally positive outcomes in terms of protecting stakeholders and certainly shareholders’ \ninterests. For example, Section 404 of SOX, which prescribes significant transparency improve-\nment on internal controls associated with accounting and auditing, has arguably improved the \ninternal auditing scrutiny (and thereby trust) in firms’ financial reporting. Moreover, research sug-\ngests that internal controls associated with Section 404 increase shareholder value.133 Nonetheless, \nsome argue that the Act, especially Section 404, creates excessive costs for firms.134 In addition, a \ndecrease in foreign firms listing on U.S. stock exchanges occurred at the same time as listing on \nforeign exchanges increased. In part, this shift may be because of the costs SOX generates for firms \nseeking to list on U.S. exchanges.\nDodd-Frank is recognized as the most sweeping set of financial regulatory reforms in the United \nStates since the Great Depression.135 The Act is intended to align financial institutions’ actions with \nsociety’s interests. Dodd-Frank includes provisions related to the categories of consumer protec-\ntion, systemic risk oversight, executive compensation, and capital requirements for banks. The Act \ncreates a Financial Stability Oversight Council headed by the Treasury secretary, establishes a new \nsystem for liquidation of certain financial companies, provides for a new framework to regulate \nderivatives, establishes new corporate governance requirements, and regulates credit rating agen-\ncies and securitizations. However, Congress has been seeking to pass relief for regional banks by \nlowering the capital requirements and requiring less obligations for big stress tests.136\nMore intensive application of governance mechanisms as mandated by legislation such as SOX \nand Dodd-Frank affects firms’ choice of strategies. For example, more intense governance might \nfind firms choosing to pursue fewer risky projects, possibly decreasing shareholder wealth as a \nresult, although some research suggests that tighter governance associated with SOX regulation \nincreases innovation, especially for firms with previously weaker governance.137 Determining gov-\nernance practices that strike an appropriate balance between protecting stakeholders’ interests and \nallowing firms to implement strategies with some degree of risk is difficult.\nOf course, the United States is not the only country that has seen changes in regulations regarding \ncorporate governance. In 2015, Japan adopted a new governance code that strongly emphasized the \nimportance of firms to elect many more independent outside directors.138 Also, the Chinese govern-\nment has taken steps to encourage more domestic institutional investment (but not foreign institutional \ninvestment).139 Governance in Japan, China, and Germany will be discussed later in this chapter.\n10-6d Creditors\nFirms use more debt than equity to finance their operations.140 Creditors have an influence over \ncorporate governance in several ways. The one that usually comes to mind is the power creditors \nhold when a firm is in default on a loan, which means the firm is not able to make the required \npayments. Creditors, using legal institutions and negotiations tactics, can have a profound influ-\nence on the decisions the firm makes when a firm is in default.\nHowever, actual defaults are not that common. Much more prevalent is when a firm violates \nfinancial covenants associated with a loan.141 Covenants regard things like the amount of leverage \na firm is allowed to have, its ability to cover its interest costs, or its total fixed charges. “Because a \nviolation of a financial covenant can be considered a default event, the lender has the right to call \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

But lenders rarely expedite the loan \nand often use the acceleration right to usher in a renegotiation of the credit agreement. Through \nthese renegotiations, the lending firms shape the governance and decisions of borrowers.…”142\nAlso, it is not uncommon for a board seat to be held by a representative of a large creditor. \nResearch has shown that bank-appointed directors can serve a certification role, in that their pres-\nence increases the confidence of other creditors that their interests are being represented. This can \nincrease the number of debt sources available to the firm, which can be especially important for \nfirms in developing economies.143 Because creditors like banks are such an important source of \ncapital in countries in which equity markets are unstable or not well developed, the influence of \ncreditors on governance may be even stronger than it is in economically developed countries.\nIn addition, firms with better governance characteristics (i.e., more independent directors) can \noften obtain lower interest rates on their debt.144 In this way, creditors are indirectly influencing a \nfirm’s governance characteristics. \n10-7 International Corporate Governance\nCorporate governance is an increasingly important issue in economies around the world, includ-\ning emerging economies. Globalization in trade, investments, and equity markets increases the \npotential value of firms throughout the world using similar mechanisms to govern corporate \nactivities. Moreover, because of globalization, major companies want to attract foreign investment. \nFor this to happen, foreign investors must be confident that adequate corporate governance mech-\nanisms are in place to protect their investments.\nOne of the most important trends pertaining to governance in the international environment is \nthe increasing influence of owners across borders.145 Many firms cross-list their shares so that they \ncan be traded on exchanges outside their home countries. However, this situation also creates ten-\nsion because norms regarding governance vary from country to country. Sovereign wealth funds \n(SWFs), which are investments funds controlled by a national government, can also exert their \ninfluence on the governance of a firm.146 For example, the China Investment Corporation, the Abu \nDhabi Investment Authority, and the Pension Fund of Norway collectively have investments worth \nmore than $2 trillion, and a lot of those investments are in countries other than their home coun-\ntries.147 Cross-border ownership influences are likely to increase similarity in governance across \ncountries over time.\nAlthough globalization is stimulating an increase in the intensity of efforts to improve corpo-\nrate governance and potentially to reduce the variation in regions’ and nations’ governance systems, \nthe reality remains that different nations do have different governance systems in place.148 Research \nshows that firms seek to invest in nations with national governance standards that are acceptable to \nthem.149 Recognizing and understanding differences in various countries’ governance systems, as \nwell as changes taking place within those systems, improves the likelihood a firm will be able to com-\npete successfully in the international markets it chooses to enter. Next, to highlight the general issues \nof differences and changes taking place in governance systems, we discuss corporate governance \npractices in two developed economies (Germany and Japan) and in the emerging economy of China. \n10-7a Corporate Governance in Germany\nIn many private German firms, the owner and manager may be the same individual. In these \ninstances, agency problems are not very prevalent.150 Even in publicly traded German corpora-\ntions, a single shareholder is often dominant, although this is changing. Thus, the concentra-\ntion of ownership is an important means of corporate governance in Germany, as it is in the \nUnited States.151\nHistorically, banks have been considered to play a prominent role in the German corporate \ngovernance system.152 This is the case in other European countries as well, such as Italy and France. \nAs lenders, banks become major shareholders when companies they financed seek funding on the \nstock market or default on loans. The banks monitor and control managers, both as lenders and as \nshareholders, by electing representatives to supervisory boards. This is not the case in the United \nStates because of the Glass Steagel Act banning bank ownership of common stocks. \nGerman firms with more than 2,000 employees are required to have a two-tiered board struc-\nture that places the responsibility for monitoring and controlling managerial (or supervisory) \nLearning Objective\n10-7 Discuss the \nnature and use of \ncorporate governance \nin international settings, \nespecially in Germany, \nJapan, and China. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Employees, union \nmembers, and shareholders appoint members to the Aufsichtsrat. \nProponents of the German structure suggest that it helps prevent corporate wrongdoing and rash \ndecisions by “dictatorial CEOs.” However, critics maintain that it slows decision making and often \nties a CEO’s hands. The corporate governance practices in Germany make it difficult to restructure \ncompanies as quickly as can be done in the United States. Because of the role of local government \n(through the board structure) and the power of banks in Germany’s corporate governance struc-\nture, private shareholders rarely have major ownership positions in German firms. Additionally, a \nsignificant number of cross-shareholdings among firms make takeovers more difficult.154 However, \nlarge institutional investors, such as pension funds (outside of banks and insurance companies), are \nalso relatively insignificant owners of corporate stock. Thus, at least historically, German executives \ngenerally have not been dedicated to maximizing shareholder wealth to the degree that is the case \nfor top-level managers in the United States and United Kingdom.155\nHowever, corporate governance practices used in Germany have been changing in recent years. \nA manifestation of these changes is that many German firms are gravitating toward U.S. gover-\nnance mechanisms. Recent research suggests that the traditional system in Germany produced \nsome agency costs because of a lack of external ownership power. Interestingly, German firms with \nlistings on U.S. stock exchanges have increasingly adopted executive stock option compensation as \na long-term incentive pay policy.156\n10-7b Corporate Governance in Japan\nThe concepts of obligation, family, and consensus affect attitudes toward corporate governance in \nJapan. As part of a company family, individuals are members of a unit that envelops their lives; \nfamilies command the attention and allegiance of parties throughout corporations. In addition, \nbecause Japan has a collectivist orientation, Japanese firms are concerned with a broader set of \nstakeholders than are firms in the United States, including employees, suppliers, and customers.157 \nConsensus, another important influence in Japanese corporate governance, calls for the expendi-\nture of significant amounts of energy to win the hearts and minds of people whenever possible, as \nopposed to top-level managers issuing edicts. Consensus is highly valued, even when it results in \na slow and cumbersome decision-making process.\nMoreover, a keiretsu (a group of firms tied together by cross-shareholdings) is more than an \neconomic concept—it, too, is a family.158 The extensive cross-shareholdings impede the type of \nstructural change that is needed to improve the nation’s corporate governance practices. How-\never, recent changes in the governance code in Japan have been fostering better opportunities from \nimproved corporate governance, fostered also by an increase in hedge fund activism.159 Also, the \nkeiretsu system itself has weakened considerably. While approximately 50 percent of shares of listed \ncompanies in Japan were tied up in keiretsu-style cross-shareholdings in 1989, this figure fell to \nabout 4 percent in 2019.160 A big part of this change is due to an increase of non-Japanese invest-\nment in Japanese listed companies.\nAs in Germany, banks in Japan have an important role in financing and monitoring large \npublic firms.161 Because the main bank in the keiretsu owns a large share position and holds a large \namount of corporate debt, it has the closest relationship with a firm’s top-level managers. The main \nbank provides financial advice to the firm and also closely monitors managers, although they have \nbecome less salient in fostering corporate restructuring.162 Thus, although it is changing, Japan has \ntraditionally had a bank-based financial and corporate governance structure, whereas the United \nStates has a market-based financial and governance structure. Remember that, as mentioned previ-\nously, commercial banks in the United States are not allowed to own shares of publicly traded firms.\nJapan’s corporate governance practices have been changing in recent years. For example, \nbecause of Japanese banks’ continuing development as economic organizations, their role in the \nmonitoring and control of managerial behavior and firm outcomes is less significant than in the \npast.163 Deregulation facilitated additional activity in Japan’s market for corporate control, which \nwas nonexistent in past years. In fact, research has found that bank-firm relationships increase the \nlikelihood of a merger or acquisition, and that banks have facilitated both restructuring and inter-\nnational expansion.164 \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

However, independent, the number of nonexecutive \nboard members are increasing in Japanese firms.165 Also, long-term executive compensation (e.g., \nstock options) is increasingly important to foster improved performance.166\n10-7c Corporate Governance in China\nChina has a unique and large economy, mixed with both socialist and market-oriented traits.167 \nChina’s listed companies have a two-tiered board system. A supervisory board has the responsibil-\nity of monitoring the board of directors.168 The role of independent directors is to both monitor and \nadvise directors. This system has elements of the two-tiered system found in Germany combined \nwith features of boards in other countries such as the United States or the United Kingdom.\nOver time, the Chinese government has done much to improve the corporate governance of \nlisted companies, particularly considering the increasing privatization of businesses and the devel-\nopment of equity markets. However, the stock markets in China remain young and are continuing \nto develop. In their early years, these markets were weak because of significant insider trading, but \nwith stronger governance these markets have improved.169 \nAlthough there has been a gradual decline in China in the equity held in state-owned enter-\nprises, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is still China’s largest controlling shareholder, and \nstill directs how Chinese companies are governed.170 Even private firms try to develop political ties \nwith the government because of their role in providing access to resources and to the economy.171 \nIn terms of long-term success, these conditions may affect firms’ performance. Research shows \nthat firms with higher state ownership tend to have lower market value and more risk of default, \nperhaps because of agency conflicts within the firms and because executives must, at times, empha-\nsize satisfying government-mandated social goals above maximizing shareholder returns.172 Such a \nmodel sets up potential conflict between the principals, particularly the state owner and the private \nequity owners of such enterprises.173\nSome evidence suggests that corporate governance in China may be tilting toward the Western \nmodel. Changing a nation’s governance systems is a complicated task that will inevitably encoun-\nter setbacks. Still, corporate governance in Chinese companies continues to evolve and likely will \ndo so for some time to come as parties (e.g., the Chinese government and those seeking further \nmovement toward free-market economies) interact to form governance mechanisms that are best \nfor their nation, business firms, and citizens. However, along with changes in the governance sys-\ntems of specific countries, multinational companies’ boards and managers are also evolving. For \nexample, firms that have entered more international markets are likely to have more top executives \nwith greater international experience and to have a larger proportion of foreign owners and foreign \ndirectors on their boards.174\n10-8 Governance Mechanisms and  \nResponsible Behavior\nThe three internal and three external governance mechanisms are designed to ensure that the \nagents of the firm’s owners—the corporation’s top-level managers—make strategic decisions that \nbest serve the interests of all stakeholders. Increasingly, top-level managers are expected to lead \ntheir firms in ways that will serve not only the shareholders, but the needs of other stakeholders, \nand society as a whole.175 Therefore, the firm’s actions and the outcomes flowing from them should \nresult in, at least, minimal satisfaction of the interests of important stakeholders; otherwise, a firm \nrisks seeing its dissatisfied stakeholders withdraw their support from the firm and provide it to \nanother. For example, customers may purchase products from another firm, employees could leave \nthe firm, suppliers could cancel their relationship with the firm, or communities could no longer \nallow permits needed to expand operations.176\nScandals at companies such as Enron, WorldCom, HealthSouth, Volkswagen, and Satyam (a \nlarge information technology company based in India), among others, emphasized the negative \neffects of poor ethical behavior on a firm’s efforts to satisfy stakeholders. Consequently, stakeholder \ngovernance of ethical behavior by top-level managers is being taken seriously in countries through-\nout the world.177 For example, the Stewardship Code was introduced in the United Kingdom “to \nLearning Objective\n10-8 Describe how \ncorporate governance \ncan foster ethical \ndecisions by a firm’s top-\nlevel managers. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

For example, research has demonstrated that multinational \nfirms with higher levels of board gender diversity are likely to engage in more CSR disclosure.180 In \nthe same study, researchers found that higher levels of tenure diversity among board members were \nassociated with more social disclosure. In an additional study, board independence was found to be \nassociated with CSR, as was the presence of an independent audit committee.181 \nAnother interesting study found that firms that had poor CSR performance were likely to have \nmore directors with backgrounds in not-for-profit, private organizations (NGOs). These directors \nwere most likely appointed to help guide the firm towards a higher level of CSR performance. Although \nthere was no immediate influence on improvement in the CSR performance of those firms, there was a \npositive effect after 3 years.182 Finally, in a large-scale evaluation of over 100 studies in over 20 countries, \nresearchers concluded that board independence is generally associated with lower levels of corporate \nmisconduct, although the relationship can vary depending on how independence is defined.183\nActivist investors can also have an impact on a firm’s CSR. In one study, researchers found that \nshareholder activists, and especially institutional activists, can influence greater disclosure of cli-\nmate change risks. Investors responded well to the increased disclosure by giving these companies \na higher valuation.184  Well-known activist Carl Icahn, who owns a McDonald’s stake worth about \n$50,000, is concerned about how the company treats pregnant pigs. As part of his strategy to get the \ncompany to change its treatment of these animals, he nominated two directors to McDonald’s board. \nHe also urged “BlackRock Inc. and other big index fund managers focused on socially conscious \ninvesting to support his proxy fight at McDonald’s Corp. for better treatment of pregnant pigs.”185\nThe decisions and actions of the board of directors can be an effective deterrent to unethi-\ncal behaviors by top-level managers. Indeed, evidence suggests that the most effective boards set \nboundaries for their firms’ business ethics and values.186 After the boundaries for ethical behavior \nare determined, and likely formalized in a code of ethics, the board’s ethics-based expectations \nmust be clearly communicated to the firm’s top-level managers and to other stakeholders (e.g., \ncustomers and suppliers) with whom interactions are necessary for the firm to produce and sell its \nproducts. Moreover, as agents of the firm’s owners, top-level managers must understand that the \nboard, acting as an internal governance mechanism, will hold them fully accountable for devel-\noping and supporting an organizational culture in which only ethical behaviors are permitted. As \nexplained in Chapter 12, CEOs can be positive role models for improved ethical behavior.187 \nThrough effective governance that results from well-designed governance mechanisms and the \nappropriate country institutions, top-level managers, working with others, can select and use strat-\negies that result in strategic competitiveness and earning above-average returns. Such governance \nalso provides long-term shareholder wealth and improved stakeholder cooperation.\nSummary\n \n● Corporate governance is the set of mechanisms used \nto manage the relationships among stakeholders and \nto determine and control the strategic direction and \nperformance of organizations. How firms monitor \nand control top-level managers’ decisions and actions \naffects the implementation of strategies. Effective \ngovernance that aligns managers’ decisions with \nshareholders’ interests can help produce a competitive \nadvantage for the firm.\n \n● Three internal governance mechanisms are used in \nthe modern corporation: ownership concentration, \nthe board of directors, and executive compensation. In \naddition, three external governance mechanisms are \nalso important: the market for corporate control, regu-\nlators, and creditors.\n \n● Ownership is separated from control in the mod-\nern corporation. Owners (principals) hire managers \n(agents) to make decisions that maximize the firm’s \nvalue. As risk-bearing specialists, owners diversify their \nrisk by investing in multiple corporations with different \nrisk profiles. Owners expect their agents (the firm’s top-\nlevel managers, who are decision-making specialists) to \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Thus, modern corporations are characterized \nby an agency relationship that is created when one \nparty (the firm’s owners) hires and pays another party \n(top-level managers) to use its decision-making skills.\n \n● Separation of ownership and control creates an agency \nproblem when an agent pursues goals that conflict \nwith the principals’ goals. Principals establish and use \ngovernance mechanisms to control this problem.\n \n● Ownership concentration is based on the number of \nlarge-block shareholders and the percentage of shares \nthey own. With significant ownership percentages, \nsuch as those held by large mutual funds and pension \nfunds, institutional investors often can influence top-\nlevel managers’ strategic decisions and actions. Thus, \nunlike diffuse ownership, which tends to result in \nrelatively weak monitoring and control of managerial \ndecisions, concentrated ownership produces more \nactive and effective monitoring.\n \n● Institutional investors are a powerful force in corpo-\nrate America, and they actively use their positions \nof concentrated ownership to force managers and \nboards of directors to make decisions that best serve \nshareholders’ interests. Shareholder activism refers to \nactions shareholders take to influence corporate policy \nand practice. Sometimes activist investors join forces \nin what are called wolf packs.\n \n● For decades, a debate has been raging regarding \nwhether top managers and boards should give the \nfirm’s shareholders higher priority than other stakehold-\ners. The pendulum is now swinging more in favor of \nserving a broader group of stakeholder interests.\n \n● In the United States and the United Kingdom, a firm’s \nboard of directors, composed of insiders, related \noutsiders, and outsiders, is a governance mechanism \nexpected to represent shareholders’ interests. The \npercentage of outside directors on many boards now \nexceeds the percentage of inside directors.\n \n● Boards are becoming increasingly diverse and indepen-\ndent, with stronger internal controls, formalized processes \nfor evaluating board member performance, modifications \nto the way directors are compensated, and the creation of \nthe role of lead director. Boards are also paying a lot more \nattention to corporate social responsibility.\n \n● Executive compensation is a highly visible and often \ncriticized governance mechanism. Salary, bonuses, \nand long-term incentives are used for the purpose of \naligning managers’ and shareholders’ interests. A firm’s \nboard of directors is responsible for determining the \neffectiveness of the firm’s executive compensation \nsystem. An effective system results in managerial deci-\nsions that are in shareholders’ best interests.\n \n● In general, evidence suggests that shareholders and \nboards of directors have become more vigilant in \ncontrolling managerial decisions. Nonetheless, these \nmechanisms are imperfect and sometimes insufficient. \n \n● When the internal mechanisms fail, the market \nfor corporate control—as an external governance \nmechanism—becomes relevant. Regulators also play \nan important role in influencing corporate governance \nfrom outside the organization. Through implementa-\ntion of the SOX Act, outsiders are expected to be more \nindependent of a firm’s top-level managers compared \nwith directors selected from inside the firm. Relatively \nrecent rules formulated and implemented by the SEC \nto allow owners with large stakes to propose new \ndirectors are beginning to change the balance even \nmore in favor of outside and independent directors. \nAdditional governance-related regulations have \nresulted from the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, credi-\ntors serve as an external governance mechanism.\n \n● Corporate governance structures used in Germany, \nJapan, and China differ from each other and from \nthe structure used in the United States. Historically, \nthe U.S. governance structure focused on maximiz-\ning shareholder value. In Germany, employees, as a \nstakeholder group, take a more prominent role in gov-\nernance. By contrast, until recently, Japanese share-\nholders played virtually no role in monitoring and con-\ntrolling top-level managers. However, Japanese firms \nare now being challenged by “activist” shareholders. In \nChina, the central government still plays a major role \nin corporate governance practices. Internationally, all \nthese systems are becoming increasingly similar.\n \n● Top-level managers are expected to lead their firms in \nways that will serve not only the shareholders, but the \nneeds of other stakeholders, and especially those that \nhave the most impact on the value the firm creates \n(e.g., customers, suppliers, employees, and host com-\nmunities). Internal corporate governance mechanisms \ndesigned and used by ethically responsible leaders \nand companies increase the ability of the firm to serve \nthe interests of a broad stakeholder group. In addition, \nexternal governance mechanisms can serve to moni-\ntor the firm and encourage responsible behavior.\nKey Terms\nagency costs 254\nagency relationship 252\nboard of directors 256\ncorporate governance 250\nexecutive compensation 259\ninstitutional owners 255\nlarge-block shareholders 254\nmanagerial opportunism 252\nmarket for corporate control 260\nownership concentration 254\nshareholder activism 255\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In 2015, Toshiba was caught \nup in an accounting scandal, and then in 2017, its U.S. nuclear- \nenergy business went bankrupt. Shareholders from outside \nJapan injected a lot of capital into the company in 2017 to \nshore up its finances, which gave them about 50 percent con-\ntrol. Toshiba had already sold off a lot of its most recognized \nbusinesses, including those making personal computers and \ntelevisions.\nToshiba shareholders were on the offensive since a report \nreleased in June 2021 indicated that the company and govern-\nment officials had been collaborating to silence shareholder \nvoices prior to a shareholder’s meeting in July 2020. In early \n2022, Satoshi Tsunukawa stepped down as CEO under pres-\nsure from shareholders. He was replaced by Satoshi Shimada, \nwho came to Toshiba in 2018 after working for a Japanese \nunit of Siemens AG (based in Germany). This change in lead-\nership came soon after the company announced its intention \nto split into two businesses—one focusing on devices and \nthe other on energy and infrastructure. “The management \nshake-up is intended to lay the groundwork for the split. \nToshiba said Mr. Shimada would lead the energy and infra-\nstructure company after the spinoff, while another newly \npromoted executive, Hiroyuki Sato, would head the device \ncompany.”\nForeign-based shareholders expressed dissatisfaction \nwith the split, and also objected to an earlier plan to divide the \ncompany into three units. Singapore-based 3D Investment \nPartners asked the strategic-review committee at Toshiba to \nconsider other options—one of them would involve selling \nto entire company to a private investor. Mr. Shimada was \nunconvinced, “We are going to go ahead with the separation \nplan as scheduled. To make that happen, we need to build a \nstrong relationship of trust with our stakeholders as quickly \nas we can.”\nIn mid-March, shareholders rejected the plan for a two-\nway split. Foreign shareholders led the rejection effort and \nsuggested that it would be better to sell the whole company \nto a private-equity firm; however, nearly 60 percent of share-\nholders voted against the plan. Later in the month, Bain \nCapital revealed that it was considering a bid for Toshiba. \n“Bain, a U.S.-based private-equity firm, said it wanted to hold \n‘careful and sincere’ discussions with Toshiba’s management, \nthe Japanese government, and banks over the possible deal.”\nFinally, toward the end of April 2022, the embattled com-\npany gave up: “Toshiba Corp. on Thursday put itself up for \nauction after pressure from foreign shareholders and said it \nwould solicit bids from investors including those who want \nto take the company private.” The company intended to move \nquickly, seeking proposals from potential suitors before its \nshareholder meeting in June of that year.\nThis drama was historically significant for Japan, “for the \nsimple reason that a vigorous and unforgiving market for \ncorporate control is normal in the U.S. Toshiba’s travails rep-\nresent a relatively new phenomenon in Japan.” Also, Toshiba \nis not just any Japanese company. It is one of Japan’s oldest \nconglomerates. The Japanese business system served to pro-\ntect management until recently. “The most obvious manifes-\ntation was the keiretsu system by which banks would orga-\nnize around themselves a constellation of client-companies \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The compa-\nny’s purpose is lofty: “To help build a better world, where every person is free to move \nand pursue their dreams.” According to current CEO Jim Farley, “What makes this \ncompany different is that Ford has a higher purpose. We serve others and improve \nlives.” In 2021, Ford sold approximately 3.9 million vehicles worldwide, with about \nhalf of those sales in North America. This sales record represents a decline from \napproximately 4.2 million in 2020 and 5.4 million in 2019. Although the company has \none of the most respected brand names in the automobile industry, something must \nbe done to put Ford on an upward trajectory again.\nIn a Strategic Focus in Chapter 2, we discussed the evolution of the global \nautomobile industry from the 1950s, when big flashy cars were popular, up to the \nrecent trend toward \nelectric vehicles. \nConsistent with this \ntrend, the Opening \nCase for Chapter 8  \ndescribed Tesla’s \naggressive expan-\nsion in Europe. Ford \nhas also moved \nstrongly in this \ndirection—the com-\npany has projected \nelectric vehicles will \naccount for about \none-third of global \nsales by 2026 and \nhalf of global sales \nby 2030. As men-\ntioned previously, \nthe company is \nnow selling about \nas many all-electric \nMustangs as gas- \npowered versions and \nis engaged in a joint venture with a Korean company to build two battery facto-\nries in North America. Ford also announced an all-electric version of its popular \nF-150 pickup truck, to be called The Lightning.\nIt can be difficult to give a new business area like electric vehicles enough at-\ntention when it is confined within an existing organizational structure. Indeed, this \nwas the case for Ford. Chief executive Jim Farley “has repeatedly said the business of \ndeveloping and selling electric vehicles is vastly different from its conventional gas- \nengine operations, requiring new technical expertise and a distinct sale strategy.” In \n2022, the company announced that it would be reorganizing its operations into two \nindependent divisions. The company “plans to keep both operations in-house with \nseparate names and their own leadership structures and profit-and-loss statements.” \nThe electric division will be called Ford Model e and the traditional division Ford Blue. \nMr. Farley says the new structure will reduce complexity and help cut costs from the \ngas-engine part of the business. This goal will be accomplished through a greater \nfocus on reducing quality problems and reducing how many models Ford sells.\nThere are still some details to work out. For instance, where will the two types \nof vehicles be manufactured? At present, it appears that the electric vehicles \ncurrently will be manufactured in the same plants as the gas vehicles, although \nfacilities built in the future for electric vehicles will sit within the Model e division. \nJoint manufacturing could make creating separate income statements difficult, \nnot to mention creating problems in determining which managers would be su-\npervising these operations. In time, these issues will all be worked out. “For now, \n© anilakkus / Getty Images\nrblfmr/Shutterstock.com\nIn April 2022, the launch of the new all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning \ntruck was celebrated at the New York Stock Exchange.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In all organizations, top-level managers \nhave the final responsibility for ensuring that the firm has matched each of its strategies with the \nappropriate organizational structure for carrying them out and that both change when necessary. \nThe match or degree of fit between strategy and structure influences the firm’s attempts to earn \nabove-average returns.2 Thus, the ability to select an appropriate strategy and match it with the \nappropriate structure is an important characteristic of effective strategic leadership.3 \nThis chapter opens with an introduction to organizational structure and controls. We \nthen provide more details about the need for the firm’s strategy and structure to be properly \nmatched. The influence of strategy and structure on each other affects firms’ efforts to match \nindividual strategies with their appropriate structure.4 As we discuss, strategy has a more \nimportant influence on structure, although once in place, structure influences strategy.5 Next, \nwe describe the relationship between growth and structural change successful firms experi-\nence. We then discuss the different organizational structures firms use to implement separate \nbusiness-level, corporate-level, international, and cooperative strategies. We present a series  \nof figures to highlight the different structures firms match with different strategies. Across \ntime and based on their experiences, organizations, especially large and complex ones, cus-\ntomize these general structures to meet their unique needs.6 Typically, firms try to form a \nstructure that is complex enough to facilitate implementation of their strategies but simple \nenough for all parties to understand and use.7\nResearch shows that organizational structure and the controls that are a part of the structure \naffect firm performance.8 In particular, evidence suggests that performance declines when the \nfirm’s strategy is not matched with the most appropriate structure and controls.9 Even though mis-\nmatches between strategy and structure do occur, research indicates that managers try to act ratio-\nnally when forming or changing their firm’s structure.10\nIn the Opening Case, we talked about the decline in Ford sales, and how the company is trying \nto cope effectively with changes in the external environment that are moving the automobile indus-\ntry toward electric vehicles. As we noted then, the firm is changing to better meet strong compet-\nitors like Tesla in that market. Specifically, changes are being made to the organizational structure \nat Ford with the expectation that doing so will lead to enhanced firm performance. The leadership \nat Ford believes that changes being made to the firm’s structure will increase its efficiency (that is, \ncost reductions) and its effectiveness (that is, it will better serve customers’ needs). \n11-1a Organizational Structure\nOrganizational structure specifies the firm’s formal reporting relationships, procedures, controls, \nand authority and decision-making processes.11 A firm’s structure determines and specifies the \ndecisions that are to be made and the work that is to be completed by everyone within an organi-\nzation as a result of those decisions.12 Organizational routines serve as processes that are used to \ncomplete the work required by individual strategies.13\nLearning Objective\n11-1 Define organizational \nstructure and controls, \nand describe the \norganizational control \ncycle.\nOrganizational structure \nspecifies the firm’s formal \nreporting relationships, \nprocedures, controls, and \nauthority and decision-\nmaking processes.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Thus, helping the firm effectively cope with environmental uncertainty is an important \ncontribution organizational structure makes to a firm as it seeks to successfully implement its \nstrategy or strategies as a means of outperforming competitors.15\nAppropriately designed organizational structures provide the stability a firm needs to \nsuccessfully implement its strategies and maintain its current competitive advantages while \nsimultaneously providing the flexibility to develop advantages it will need in the future.16 More \nspecifically, structural stability provides the capacity the firm requires to consistently and pre-\ndictably manage its daily work routines, while structural flexibility makes it possible for the \nfirm to identify opportunities and then allocate resources to pursue them as a way of being \nprepared to succeed in the future.17 Thus, an effectively flexible organizational structure allows \nthe firm to exploit current competitive advantages while developing new advantages that can be \nused in the future. Alternatively, an ineffective structure that is inflexible may drive produc-\ntive employees away because of frustration while completing their work.18 Losing productive \nemployees can result in a loss of knowledge within a firm.19 This is an especially damaging out-\ncome when a departing employee, who may accept employment with a competitor, possesses a \nsignificant amount of tacit knowledge.20\nModifications to the firm’s current strategy or selection of a new strategy may call for  \nchanges to its organizational structure. However, research shows that once in place, organi-\nzational inertia often inhibits efforts to change structure, even when the firm’s performance \nsuggests that it is time to do so.21 In his pioneering work, Alfred Chandler found that orga-\nnizations change their structures when inefficiencies force them to do so.22 Chandler’s contri-\nbutions to our understanding of organizational structure and its relationship to strategies and \nperformance are significant. Indeed, some believe that Chandler’s emphasis on “organizational  \nstructure so transformed the field of business history that some call the \nperiod before Chandler’s work was published ‘B.C.,’ meaning ‘before \nChandler.’”23\nFirms seem to prefer the structural status quo and its familiar work-\ning relationships until their performance declines to the point where \nchange is absolutely necessary.24 Moreover, top-level managers often \nhesitate to conclude that the firm’s structure or its strategy are the prob-\nlem because doing so suggests that their previous choices were not the \nbest ones.25 Because of these inertial tendencies, structural change is \noften induced instead by actions from stakeholders (e.g., those from \nthe capital market and customers) who are no longer willing to toler-\nate the firm’s performance. Evidence shows that appropriate timing of \nstructural change happens when top-level managers recognize that a \ncurrent organizational structure no longer provides the coordination \nand direction needed for the firm to successfully implement its strat-\negies.26 Interestingly, many organizational changes take place in eco-\nnomic downturns because poor performance reveals organizational \nweaknesses.27 As we discuss next, effective organizational controls help \nmanagers recognize when it is time to adjust the firm’s structure.\n11-1b Organizational Controls\nOrganizational controls are an important aspect of structure.28 \nOrganizational controls guide the use of strategy, indicate how to com-\npare actual results with expected results, and suggest corrective actions \nto take when the difference is unacceptable. It is difficult for a firm to \nsuccessfully exploit its competitive advantages without effective orga-\nnizational controls.\nOrganizational controls \nguide the use of strategy, \nindicate how to compare \nactual results with expected \nresults, and suggest corrective \nactions to take when the \ndifference is unacceptable.\nNytimes\nPictured here is Alfred Chandler, a scholar whose \nwork enhanced our understanding of organizational \nstructure and strategy.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Controls are a function \nof the strategic planning process. As described in Chapters 2 through 9, firms formulate strat-\negies based on internal analysis, external analysis, and their missions, visions, and values. In \ndoing so, they develop a sense of what these strategies should accomplish for the organization. \nThese desired outcomes are translated into objectives. It is important also that once objec-\ntives are established, an individual or group (i.e., department, division) within the organiza-\ntion is given responsibility for their accomplishment. This individual or group then develops \na detailed implementation plan, including a budget and a time frame for accomplishment. \nResources are allocated to support the plan. At various points during the implementation pro-\ncess, those responsible for implementation return and report to higher level management. At \nthis point, objectives are compared to actual performance and an assessment is done to deter-\nmine whether the plan is on track or, if not, what is holding it back. Adjustments are made as \nneeded. These regular assessments become information that is useful to the next round of the \ncontrol cycle. Such information is useful to strategy formulation, objective setting, and creat-\ning updated or new implementation plans.29\n11-2 Strategic and Financial Controls\nProperly designed organizational controls provide clear insights about behaviors that enhance \nfirm performance.30 Firms use both strategic controls and financial controls to support imple-\nmentation of their strategies. Strategic controls are largely subjective criteria intended to \nverify that the firm is using appropriate strategies for external conditions and the company’s \ncompetitive advantages. Thus, strategic controls are for examining the fit between what the \nfirm might do (according to the opportunities in its external environment) and what it can \ndo (according to its internal organization through its resources, capabilities, and core compe-\ntencies). Effective strategic controls help the firm understand what it takes to be successful, \nespecially where significant strategic change is needed.31 Strategic controls demand rich com-\nmunications between managers who use them to judge the firm’s performance and those who \nimplement the firm’s strategies (such as middle- and first-level managers). These frequent \nexchanges between managers are both formal and informal.32\nStrategic controls are also used to evaluate the degree to which the firm focuses on the \nrequirements to implement its strategies. For a business-level strategy, for example, the strate-\ngic controls are used to study value-chain activities and support functions (see Figures 3.3, 3.4, \nand 3.5 in Chapter 3) to verify that the critical activities and functions are being emphasized \nand properly executed. When implementing related diversification strategies at the corporate \nlevel, strategic controls are used to verify the sharing of activities (for the related-constrained \nstrategy) or the transferring of core competencies (for the related-linked strategy) across busi-\nnesses. To effectively use strategic controls when evaluating either of these related diversifica-\ntion strategies, headquarter executives must have a deep understanding of the business-level \nstrategies being implemented within individual strategic business units.33\nLearning Objective\n11-2 Discuss the difference \nbetween strategic and \nfinancial controls.\nStrategic controls are \nlargely subjective criteria \nintended to verify that the \nfirm is using appropriate \nstrategies for the conditions \nin the external environment \nand the company’s \ncompetitive advantages.\nFigure 11.1 A Typical Organizational Control Cycle\nFormulate\nStrategies Based on\nInternal Analysis,\nExternal Analysis,\nMission, Vision, Values\nDevelop Objectives\nBased on Desired\nOutcomes\n• Strategic (subjective)\n• Financial (objective)\nDetailed Plan of Action\n• Assign responsibility\n• Implementation plan\n• Budget and time frame\n• Allocation of resources\nReturn and Report\n• Compare objectives to\n  performance\n• Assess outcomes\n• Feedback information\ntime\nFeedback to guide next control cycle\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

When using financial controls, firms \nevaluate their current performance against previous outcomes and competitors’ performance \nand industry averages.34 Accounting-based measures, such as return on investment (ROI) and \nreturn on assets (ROA), as well as market-based measures, such as shareholder returns, are \nexamples of financial controls. Partly because strategic controls are difficult to use with exten-\nsive diversification (e.g., top executives are not deeply familiar with each of the businesses), \nfinancial controls are emphasized to evaluate the firm’s performance using an unrelated diver-\nsification strategy. 35 The unrelated diversification strategy’s focus on financial outcomes (see \nChapter 6) requires using standardized financial controls to compare performances between \nbusiness units and those responsible for leading them.36\nBoth strategic and financial controls are important aspects of a firm’s structure; as noted \npreviously, any structure’s effectiveness is determined using a “balanced” combination \nof strategic and financial controls. But, determining the most appropriate balance to have  \nin place between strategic and financial controls at specific times is challenging, partly because \nthe relative use of controls varies by type of strategy. For example, companies and business \nunits of large diversified firms using the cost leadership strategy emphasize financial controls \n(such as quantitative cost goals), while companies and business units using the differentia-\ntion strategy emphasize strategic controls (such as subjective measures of the effectiveness \nof product development teams).37 As previously explained, a corporation-wide emphasis on \nsharing among business units (as called for by related diversification strategies) results in \nan emphasis on strategic controls, while financial controls are emphasized for strategies in \nwhich activities or capabilities are not shared (e.g., in an unrelated diversification strategy).  \nThose determining how strategies are to be implemented must keep these relative degrees of \nbalance between controls by type of strategy in mind when making implementation-related \ndecisions.\n11-3 Relationship between Strategy  \nand Structure\nStrategy and structure have a reciprocal relationship and, if aligned properly, performance \nimproves.38 This relationship highlights the interconnectedness between strategy formulation \n(Chapters 4, 6–9) and strategy implementation (Chapters 10–13). In general, this reciprocal \nrelationship finds structure flowing from or following selection of the firm’s strategy. Once \nin place, though, structure can influence current strategic actions and choices about future \nstrategies.39 The new structure Ford is building, that we mentioned earlier, has the potential \nto influence implementation of strategies that are, in part, aimed to better identify and satisfy \ncustomers’ demand for high-quality electric vehicles at lower prices than other auto manu-\nfacturers.40 Overall, those involved with a firm’s strategic management process should under-\nstand that the general nature of the strategy/structure relationship means that changes to the \nfirm’s strategy create the need to change how the organization completes its work.\nMoreover, because structure can influence strategy by constraining the potential alterna-\ntives considered, firms must be vigilant in their efforts to verify how their structure not only \naffects implementation of chosen strategies, but also the limits the structure placed on possible \nfuture strategies. Overall, the effect of strategy on structure is stronger than is the effect of \nstructure on strategy.\nRegardless of the strength of the reciprocal relationships between strategy and structure, \nthose choosing the firm’s strategy and structure should be committed to matching each strat-\negy with a structure that provides the stability needed to use current competitive advantages \nand the flexibility required to develop future advantages.41 Therefore, when changing strat-\negies, the firm should simultaneously consider the structure that will be needed to support \nuse of the new strategy—properly matching strategy and structure can create a competitive \nadvantage. \nFinancial controls are \nlargely objective criteria \nused to measure the firm’s \nperformance against \npreviously established \nquantitative standards.\nLearning Objective\n11-3 Describe the \nrelationship between \nstrategy and structure.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Chandler found that firms tend to grow in somewhat predictable patterns: “first by \nvolume, then by geography, then integration (vertical, horizontal), and finally through product/\nbusiness diversification”42 (see Figure 11.2). Chandler interpreted his findings as an indication that \nfirms’ growth patterns determine their structural form.\nAs shown in Figure 11.2, sales growth creates coordination and control problems the exist-\ning organizational structure cannot efficiently handle. Some of the most common symptoms of \nstructural deficiency include communications problems, poor customer satisfaction, adminis-\ntrative inefficiencies, and employee frustration.43 Organizational growth creates the opportunity \nfor the firm to change its strategy to try to become even more successful. However, the existing \nstructure’s formal reporting relationships, procedures, controls, and authority and decision- \nmaking processes lack the sophistication required to support using the new strategy, meaning \nthat a modified organizational structure is needed.44\nFirms choose from among three major types of organizational structures—simple, func-\ntional, and multidivisional—to implement strategies. Across time, successful firms move from \nthe simple, to the functional, and to the multidivisional structure to support changes in their \ngrowth strategies.\n11-4a Simple Structure\nThe simple structure is an organizational form in which the owner-manager makes all major \ndecisions and monitors all activities, while the staff serves as an extension of the manag-\ner’s supervisory authority.45 Typically, the owner-manager actively works in the business \ndaily. Informal relationships, few rules, limited task specialization, and unsophisticated  \ninformation systems characterize this structure. Frequent and informal communications \nbetween the owner-manager and employees make coordinating the work to be completed rel-\natively easy. The simple structure is matched with focus strategies and business-level strategies \nin which a firm offers a single product line in a single geographic market. Local restaurants, \nrepair businesses, and other specialized enterprises are examples of firms using the simple \nstructure.\nLearning Objective\n11-4 Describe the major \ntypes of organizational \nstructures used to \nimplement strategies.\nThe simple structure is an \norganizational form in which \nthe owner-manager makes all \nmajor decisions and monitors \nall activities, while the staff \nserves as an extension of \nthe manager’s supervisory \nauthority.\nFigure 11.2 Strategy and Structure Growth Pattern\nSimple structure\nEfficient implementation\nof formulated strategy\nSales growth\nGrowth in sales\nand diversification\nCoordination and\ncontrol problems\nCoordination and\ncontrol problems\nEfficient implementation\nof formulated strategy\nFunctional Structure\nEfficient implementation\nof formulated strategy\nMultidivisional Structure\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Additional \ngrowth and success may cause the firm to change its strategy. Even if the strategy remains the \nsame, the firm’s larger size dictates the need for more sophisticated workflows and integrating \nmechanisms.47 At this evolutionary point, firms tend to move from the simple structure to a \nfunctional organizational structure.48\n11-4b Functional Structure\nThe functional structure consists of a chief executive officer and a limited corporate staff, \nwith functional line managers in dominant organizational areas such as production, account-\ning, marketing, R&D, engineering, and human resources.49 The structure allows for functional \nspecialization, thereby facilitating active sharing of knowledge within each functional area.50 \nKnowledge sharing facilitates career paths as well as professional development of functional \nspecialists. However, a functional orientation can negatively affect communication and coor-\ndination among those representing different organizational functions. For this reason, the \nCEO must verify that the decisions and actions of individual business functions promote the \nentire firm rather than a single function. As demonstrated in the Strategic Focus, Apple has \novercome communication and coordination problems, and has mastered the art of using a \nfunctional structure.\nAlthough Apple is an exception to the general rule, the functional structure typically is used to \nsupport implementing business-level strategies and some corporate-level strategies (e.g., single or \ndominant business) with low levels of diversification. However, when changing from a simple to \na functional structure, firms want to avoid introducing value-destroying bureaucratic procedures \nsince such procedures typically have the potential to damage individuals’ efforts to innovate as a \nmeans of supporting strategy implementation activities.51\n11-4c Multidivisional Structure\nWith continuing growth and success, firms often consider greater levels of diversification. \nSuccessfully using a diversification strategy requires analyzing substantially greater amounts \nof data and information when the firm offers the same products in different markets (market \nor geographic diversification) or offers different products in several markets (product diver-\nsification). In addition, trying to manage high levels of diversification through functional \nstructures creates serious coordination and control problems, which often leads to a new \nstructural form.52\nThe multidivisional structure consists of a corporate office and operating divisions, each \noperating division representing a separate business or profit center in which the top corpo-\nrate officer delegates responsibilities for day-to-day operations and business-unit strategy to \ndivision managers. Each division represents a distinct, self-contained business with its own \nfunctional hierarchy.53 As initially designed, the multidivisional structure was thought to have \nthree major benefits: “(1) it enabled corporate officers to more accurately monitor the perfor-\nmance of each business, which simplified the problem of control; (2) it facilitated compari-\nsons between divisions, which improved the resource allocation process; and (3) it stimulated \nmanagers of poorly performing divisions to look for ways of improving performance.”54 Active \nmonitoring of performance through the multidivisional structure increases the likelihood that \ndecisions made by managers heading individual units will be in stakeholders’ best interests. \nBecause diversification is a dominant corporate-level strategy used in the global economy, the \nmultidivisional is a widely adopted organizational structure.55\nUsed to support implementation of related and unrelated diversification strategies, the \nmultidivisional structure helps firms successfully manage diversification’s many demands.56 \nChandler viewed the multidivisional structure as an innovative response to coordination and \ncontrol problems that surfaced during the 1920s in the functional structures then used by \nlarge firms such as DuPont and General Motors.57 Research shows that the multidivisional \nstructure is appropriate when the firm grows through diversification.58 Partly because of its \nvalue to diversified corporations, some consider the multidivisional structure to be one of the \ntwentieth century’s most significant organizational innovations.59\nThe multidivisional \nstructure consists of a \ncorporate office and operating \ndivisions, each operating \ndivision representing a \nseparate business or profit \ncenter in which the top \ncorporate officer delegates \nresponsibilities for day-to-day \noperations and business-unit \nstrategy to division managers.\nThe functional structure \nconsists of a chief executive \nofficer and a limited corporate \nstaff, with functional line \nmanagers in dominant \norganizational areas such \nas production, accounting, \nmarketing, R&D, engineering, \nand human resources.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Peter Drucker, a famous business writer, said the following about this matter, \n“There is no one right organization… Rather the task … is to select the organization for the partic-\nular task and mission at hand.”60 This statement suggests that the firm must select a structure that \nis “right” for successfully using the chosen strategy. This is certainly evident in the case of Apple, \ndescribed in the Strategic Focus. Because no single structure is optimal in all instances, managers \nconcentrate on developing proper matches between strategies and organizational structures rather \nthan searching for an “optimal” structure. We now describe the strategy/structure matches that \ncontribute positively to firm performance.\nApple’s Astonishing Success with Its Functional Structure\nApple Inc. was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and \nRonald Wayne. The first commercially available personal computer \noffered by Apple, the Apple I, was very basic and did not gain a \nlot of traction. However, its new computer, the Apple II, became \na bestseller. In the mid-1980s, amid high product costs and strife \namong top executives, Jobs left Apple and founded NeXT with the \nobjective of creating the next great computer.\nAfter several years of poor performance, in 1997, Apple bought \nNeXT and brought Jobs back into the company, hoping he could \nhelp turn things around. He quickly restructured the company, \ndropping projects that were losing money and reorganizing \nthe company into a functional structure. Jobs retained all con-\ntrol of the company and made all significant strategic decisions. \nThis approach dramatically limited the autonomy of Apple’s \nvice presidents. When Tim Cook took over in 2011, he left the \nfunctional structure in place, but gave the vice presidents a lot \nmore decision-making authority to encourage innovation. “The \nexpertise-focused hierarchy system that Apple has implemented \nwithin their organization means that they enjoy strong corporate \ncontrol. The individual divisions all enjoy enough autonomy to \nenable them to perform at their very best, leading Apple to have \ncreated some truly market-leading products over the years.” \nThe functional structure means that managers have “deep exper-\ntise” in their functional areas, which is one of the strengths of this type \nof structure. Managers at all levels are also expected to be “immersed \nin the details of those functions.” For example, Dierdre O’Brien, senior \nvice president of Retail + People, is an expert on everything to do with \nthe retail environment. Sabih Kahn, senior vice president of opera-\ntions, is the operations guru. Lisa Jackson, vice president for environ-\nment, policy, and social initiatives, is an expert on corporate social \nresponsibility.\nHaving a functional structure doesn’t mean that the various \nparts of the organization do not communicate or work with each \nother. “Apple Inc. maintains an intensive and effective collabora-\ntion between various groups and divisions of the company. Each \nproduct within Apple portfolio such as iPad, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV \nand iWatch is a result of collaboration of product-based groups.” \nDecisions are made in a coordinated fashion by a group of people \nthat has the best qualifications to make them. As described by \nApple executives, “Apple is not a company where general man-\nagers oversee managers; rather, it is a company where experts \nlead experts.” Manager bonuses depend on the whole company’s \nsuccess.\nThe rarity of the functional structure in a company like Apple \nis noteworthy. “Functional organizational structure is not common \nfor behemoths like Apple, however, the tech giant benefits \nfrom the current patterns of its corporate structure. Specifically, \nunlike many other large companies there is no fight between  \nheads of product divisions at Apple for resources. Moreover,  \nfunctional organizational structure allows the tech giant to neglect \nshort-term financial targets when developing new products \nthat require considerable investments.” Although the functional  \nstructure may not be practical or efficient in some huge, multi-\nproduct companies, it has been working at Apple for over two \ndecades.\nSources: 2022, Apple’s organizational structure, Organimi, www.organimi.com, May 3; \nP.

The dif-\nferences in these forms are accounted for primarily by different uses of three important structural \ncharacteristics: specialization (concerned with the type and number of jobs required to complete \nwork), centralization (the degree to which decision-making authority is retained at higher mana-\ngerial levels), and formalization (the degree to which formal rules and procedures govern work).61\n11-5a Using the Functional Structure to Implement the Cost \nLeadership Strategy\nFirms using the cost leadership strategy sell large quantities of standardized products to an indus-\ntry’s typical customer. Firms using this strategy need a structure that allows them to achieve effi-\nciencies and deliver their products at costs lower than those of competitors.62 Simple reporting \nrelationships, a few layers in the decision-making and authority structure, a centralized corporate \nstaff, and a strong focus on process improvements through the manufacturing function (rather \nthan the development of new products by emphasizing product R&D) help to achieve the needed \nefficiencies and thus characterize the cost leadership form of the functional structure (see Figure \n11.3).63 This structure contributes to the emergence of a low-cost culture—a culture in which \nemployees constantly try to find ways to reduce the costs incurred to complete their work.64 They \ncan do this through the development of a product design that is simple and easy to manufacture, \nas well as through the development of efficient processes to produce the goods.65\nIn terms of centralization, decision-making authority is centralized in a staff function to main-\ntain a cost-reducing emphasis within each organizational function (engineering, marketing, etc.). \nWhile encouraging continuous cost reductions, the centralized staff also verifies that further cuts \nin costs in one function won’t adversely affect the productivity levels in other functions.66\nJobs are highly specialized in the cost leadership functional structure; work is divided into \nhomogeneous subgroups. Organizational functions (i.e., marketing, operations, finance) are \nthe most common subgroup, although work is sometimes batched based on products deliv-\nered or clients served. Specializing in their work allows employees to increase their efficiency, \nLearning Objective\n11-5 Explain how the \nfunctional structure is \nused to implement the \nbusiness-level strategies.\nFigure 11.3 Functional Structure for Implementing a Cost Leadership Strategy\nOffice of the President\nEngineering\nMarketing\nOperations\nPersonnel\nAccounting\nCentralized Staff\nNotes:\n• \nOperations is the main function.\n• \nProcess engineering is emphasized rather than new product R&D.\n• \nRelatively large centralized staff coordinates functions.\n• \nFormalized procedures allow for emergence of a low-cost culture.\n• \nOverall structure is mechanistic; job roles are highly structured.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Guiding individuals’ work in this structure are highly formalized \nrules and procedures, which often emanate from the centralized staff.\nWalmart Stores, Inc. uses the functional structure to implement cost leadership strategies in \neach of its three operating segments (Walmart U.S., Sam’s Clubs, and Walmart International). In \nfact, researchers discovered that Walmart’s emphasis on cost cutting has actually increased over \nthe years.67 Competitors’ efforts to duplicate the success Walmart has achieved by implementing \nits cost leadership strategies have generally failed, partly because of the effective strategy/structure \nmatches the firm has formed between the cost leadership strategy and the functional structure that \nis specific to the mandates of that strategy.\n11-5b Using the Functional Structure to Implement the \nDifferentiation Strategy\nFirms using the differentiation strategy seek to deliver products that customers perceive as being \ndifferent in ways that create value for them. Relatively complex and flexible reporting relationships, \nfrequent use of cross-functional product development teams, and a strong focus on marketing and \nproduct R&D characterize the differentiation form of the functional structure (see Figure 11.4).68 \nFrom this structure emerges a development-oriented culture in which employees try to find ways \nto further differentiate current products and to develop new, highly differentiated products.69\nContinuous product innovation demands that people throughout the firm interpret and take \naction based on information that is often ambiguous, incomplete, and uncertain. Following a \nstrong focus on the external environment to identify new opportunities, employees often gather \nthis information from people outside the firm (e.g., customers and suppliers). Commonly, rapid \nresponses to the possibilities indicated by the collected information are necessary, suggesting \nthe need for decentralized decision-making responsibility and authority. This is consistent with \nwhat Apple’s CEO Tim Cook did when he took over Apple, which uses a functional structure to \nimplement its differentiation strategy (see Strategic Focus).70 The structure helps Apple keep its \ntechnological capabilities strong and provides strategic flexibility necessary to compete against \nrivals. A strong technological capability and strategic flexibility enhance a firm’s ability to take \nadvantage of opportunities that changes in markets create.71 \nThe level of specialization can be high or low in this structure when implementing a differen-\ntiation strategy. In the case of Apple, specialization is high, as indicated by the number of “experts” \nin the organization. However, many firms implementing a differentiation strategy through a func-\ntional structure have low specialization, which means that employees need a broad understanding \nFigure 11.4 Functional Structure for Implementing a Differentiation Strategy\nNew Product\nR&D\nHuman\nResources\nOperations\nMarketing\nFinance\nMarketing\nR&D\nPresident and\nLimited Staff\nNotes:\n• \nMarketing is the main function for keeping track of new product ideas.\n• \nNew product R&D is emphasized.\n• \nMost functions are decentralized, but R&D and marketing may have centralized staffs that work closely with each other.\n• \nFormalization is limited so that new product ideas can emerge easily and change is more readily accomplished.\n• \nOverall structure is organic; job roles are less structured.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Few formal rules and procedures characterize this structure. \nLow formalization and decentralization of decision-making authority and responsibility, create a \nstructure in which people interact frequently to exchange ideas about how to further differentiate \ncurrent products while developing ideas for new products that can be crisply differentiated at a \npoint in the future. Again, this is consistent with Apple’s structure.\n11-5c Using the Functional Structure to Implement the Integrated  \nCost Leadership/Differentiation Strategy\nFirms using the integrated cost leadership/differentiation strategy sell products that create value \nbecause of their relatively low cost and reasonable sources of differentiation. The cost of these \nproducts is low “relative” to the cost leader’s prices, while their differentiation is “reasonable” when \ncompared to the clearly unique features of the differentiator’s products.\nAlthough challenging to implement, the integrated cost leadership/differentiation strategy is used \nfrequently in the global economy. The challenge of using this strategy is due largely to the fact that \ndifferent value chain and support activities (see Chapter 3) are emphasized when using the cost leader-\nship and differentiation strategies. To achieve the cost leadership position, production and process engi-\nneering need to be emphasized, with infrequent product changes. To achieve a differentiated position, \nmarketing and new product R&D need to be emphasized while production and process engineering \nare not. Thus, effective use of the integrated strategy depends on the firm’s successful combination of \nactivities intended to reduce costs with activities intended to create differentiated features for a product. \nAs a result, the integrated form of the functional structure must have decision-making patterns that are \npartially centralized and partially decentralized. Additionally, jobs are semi-specialized, and rules and \nprocedures call for some formal and some informal job behavior. All of this requires a measure of flexi-\nbility to emphasize one or the other set of functions at any given time.72\n11-6 Matches between Corporate-Level \nStrategies and the Multidivisional Structure\nAs explained earlier, Chandler’s research demonstrated that the firm’s continuing success leads \nto product or market diversification or both.73 The firm’s level of diversification is a function \nof decisions about the number and type of businesses in which it will compete as well as how \nit will manage those businesses (see Chapter 6). Geared to managing individual organizational \nfunctions, increasing diversification eventually creates information processing, coordination, and \ncontrol problems that the functional structure cannot handle. Thus, using a diversification strategy \nrequires the firm to change from the functional structure to the multidivisional structure to form \nan appropriate strategy/structure match.\nAs defined in Figure 6.1, corporate-level strategies have different degrees of product and market \ndiversification. The demands created by different levels of diversification highlight the need for a \nunique organizational structure to effectively implement each strategy (see Figure 11.5). We dis-\ncuss the relationships between three diversification strategies and the unique organizational struc-\nture that should be matched with each one in the next three sections.\nLearning Objective\n11-6 Explain the use of \nthree versions of the \nmultidivisional structure \nto implement different \ndiversification strategies.\nFigure 11.5 Three Variations of the Multidivisional Structure\nMultidivisional\nStructure\n(M-form)\nStrategic Business Unit\n(SBU) Form\nCooperative\nForm\nCompetitive\nForm\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Divisions in a firm using the related constrained diver-\nsification strategy commonly are formed around products, markets, or both. In Figure 11.6, we \nuse product divisions as part of the representation of the cooperative form of the multidivisional \nstructure, although market divisions could be used instead of, or in addition to, product divisions \nto develop the figure.\nAs explained in Chapter 6, the related constrained strategy finds a firm sharing resources and \nactivities across its businesses. Sharing divisional competencies facilitates a firm’s efforts to develop \neconomies of scope (cost savings resulting from the sharing of competencies developed in one \ndivision with another division). Caterpillar uses a cooperative form of the multidivisional structure \nto implement its related constrained strategy. Rather than having decision-making authority vested \nin a management hierarchy, it is distributed throughout the organization in self-organizing teams.74\nThe cooperative structure uses different characteristics of structure (centralization, standardiza-\ntion, and formalization) as integrating mechanisms to facilitate interdivisional cooperation. Frequent, \ndirect contact between division managers, another integrating mechanism, encourages and supports \ncooperation and the sharing of knowledge, capabilities, or other resources that could be used to create \nnew advantages.75 Sometimes liaison roles are established in each division to reduce the time divi-\nsion managers spend integrating and coordinating their unit’s work with the work occurring in other \ndivisions. Temporary teams or task forces may be formed around projects whose success depends on \nsharing resources that are embedded within several divisions. Formal integration departments might \nbe established in firms frequently using inter-business unit teams or task forces.\nThe success of the cooperative multidivisional structure is significantly affected by how well \ndivisions process information.

Moreover, coordination \namong divisions sometimes results in an unequal flow of positive outcomes to divisional man-\nagers. In other words, when managerial rewards are based at least in part on the performance \nof individual divisions, the manager of the division that can benefit the most by the sharing of \ncorporate competencies might be viewed as receiving relative gains at others’ expense. Strategic \ncontrols are important in these instances, as divisional managers’ performance can be evaluated, at \nleast partly, based on how well they have facilitated interdivisional cooperative efforts. In addition, \nusing reward systems that emphasize overall company performance, besides outcomes achieved by \nindividual divisions, helps overcome problems associated with the cooperative form. Still, the costs \nof coordination and inertia in organizations limit the amount of related diversification attempted \n(i.e., they constrain the economies of scope that can be created).76\nUltimately, a matrix organization may evolve in firms implementing the related constrained \nstrategy. A matrix organization is an organizational structure in which a dual structure combines \nboth business product or project specialization and functional specialization.77 Although compli-\ncated, an effective matrix structure can lead to improved coordination among a firm’s divisions.78 \nWe mentioned in Chapter 6 that Procter & Gamble (P&G) uses a related constrained strategy. For \nyears, the company used the cooperative form of the multidivisional structure to implement this \nstrategy, but recently, it changed to a matrix to enhance its ability to navigate its global markets. The \ncompany is now organized around five industry-based divisions: beauty; health care, grooming; \nfabric and home care; and baby, feminine, and family care. Each of these divisions has responsi-\nbility for its own sales, profit, cash flow, and value creation. In addition, P&G is also divided into \nfocus markets, with market operations specialists. These specialists work across the industry-based \ndivision, providing market services, customer teams, warehousing, transportation, logistics, and \npublic relations.79\n11-6b Using the Strategic Business Unit Form of the Multidivisional \nStructure to Implement the Related Linked Strategy\nFirms with fewer links or less constrained links among their divisions use the related linked \ndiversification strategy. The strategic business unit form of the multidivisional structure supports \nimplementation of this strategy. The strategic business unit (SBU) form is a multidivisional struc-\nture consisting of three levels: corporate headquarters, strategic business units (SBUs), and SBU \ndivisions (see Figure 11.7). The SBU structure is used by large firms and can be complex, given \nassociated organization size and product and market diversity.\nThe divisions within each SBU are related in terms of shared products or markets or both, but \nthe divisions of one SBU have little in common with the divisions of the other SBUs. Divisions within \neach SBU share product or market competencies to develop economies of scope and possibly econ-\nomies of scale. The integrating mechanisms discussed earlier can be used by the divisions within the \nindividual strategic business units that are part of the SBU form of the multidivisional structure. In \nthis structure, each SBU is a profit center that is controlled and evaluated by the headquarters office. \nAlthough both financial and strategic controls are important, on a relative basis, financial controls are \nvital to headquarters’ evaluation of each SBU; strategic controls are critical when the heads of SBUs \nevaluate their divisions’ performances. Strategic controls are also critical to the headquarters’ efforts \nto evaluate the quality of the portfolio of businesses that has been formed and to determine if those \nbusinesses are being successfully managed. Sharing competencies among units within individual \nSBUs is an important characteristic of the SBU form of the multidivisional structure.\nA disadvantage associated with the related linked diversification strategy is that, even when \nefforts to implement it are being properly supported by use of the SBU form of the multidivisional \nstructure, firms using this strategy and structure combination find it challenging to effectively \ncommunicate the value of their operations to shareholders and to other investors due to its com-\nplexity.80 Furthermore, if coordination between SBUs is required, problems can surface because \nthe SBU structure, similar to the competitive form discussed next, does not readily foster coopera-\ntion across SBUs. Accordingly, those responsible for implementing the related linked strategy must \nfocus on successfully creating and using the types of integrating mechanisms we discussed earlier.\nFor many years, Sony Corporation used the related constrained strategy and the cooperative \nform of the multidivisional structure to implement it. In recent years, and in response to declining \nThe strategic business \nunit (SBU) form is a \nmultidivisional structure \nconsisting of three levels: \ncorporate headquarters, \nstrategic business units \n(SBUs), and SBU divisions.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In particular, Sony (now \ncalled Sony Group Corporation) decentralized its operating and management structure, making \neach strategic business unit more independent, with its own leadership and staff functions.81 Below \nthe Sony Group Corporation are six SBUs: Game & Network Service; Music; Pictures; Electronic \nProducts & Solutions; Imaging & Sensing Solutions; and Financial Services.82 The new structure \nwas devised, in part, to help overcome the primary weakness of the SBU structure (lack of coop-\neration across businesses). The group-level managers devote attention to “value creation through \nGroup synergies and business incubation.”83\n11-6c Using the Competitive Form of the Multidivisional Structure \nto Implement the Unrelated Diversification Strategy\nFirms using the unrelated diversification strategy want to create value through efficient internal \ncapital allocations or by restructuring, buying, and selling businesses.84 The competitive form of \nthe multidivisional structure supports implementation of this strategy.\nThe competitive form is a multidivisional structure characterized by complete independence \namong the firm’s divisions that compete for corporate resources (see Figure 11.8). Unlike the divi-\nsions included in the cooperative structure, divisions that are part of the competitive structure do \nnot share common corporate strengths. Accordingly, integrating mechanisms are not part of the \ncompetitive form of the multidivisional structure.\nThe efficient internal capital market that is the foundation for using the unrelated diversification \nstrategy requires organizational arrangements emphasizing divisional competition rather than coop-\neration.85 Three benefits are expected from the internal competition. First, internal competition creates \nflexibility (e.g., corporate headquarters can have divisions working on different technologies and proj-\nects to identify those with the greatest potential). Resources can then be allocated to the division appear-\ning to have the most potential to drive the entire firm’s success.86 Second, internal competition challenges \nThe competitive form is \na multidivisional structure \ncharacterized by complete \nindependence among the \nfirm’s divisions that compete \nfor corporate resources.\nFigure 11.7 SBU Form of the Multidivisional Structure for Implementing a Related Linked Strategy\nPresident\nHeadquarters Office\nStrategic\nPlanning\nCorporate\nMarketing\nCorporate\nHuman\nResources\nCorporate\nFinance\nCorporate\nR&D\nStrategic\nBusiness\nUnit\nStrategic\nBusiness\nUnit\nStrategic\nBusiness\nUnit\nDivision\nDivision\nDivision\nDivision\nDivision\nDivision\nDivision\nDivision\nDivision\nNotes:\n• \nStructural integration among divisions within SBUs, but independence across SBUs.\n• \nStrategic planning may be the most prominent function in headquarters for managing the strategic planning approval process of SBUs for the president.\n• \nEach SBU may have its own budget for staff to foster integration.\n• \nCorporate headquarters staff members serve as consultants to SBUs and divisions, rather than having direct input to product strategy, as in the cooperative form.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Third, \ninternal competition motivates effort in that the challenge of competing against internal peers can be \nas great as the challenge of competing against external rivals.87 In this structure, organizational controls \n(primarily financial controls) are used to emphasize and support internal competition among separate \ndivisions and as the basis for allocating corporate capital based on divisions’ performances. However, \nthis structure can be limited by too much emphasis on divisional rewards and can create disharmony \ndue to social comparison about rewards based on personal effort.88\nTextron Inc., a large “multi-industry” company, seeks to identify, research, select, acquire, and inte-\ngrate companies and has developed a set of rigorous criteria to guide decision making. Textron contin-\nuously looks to enhance and reshape its portfolio by divesting noncore assets and acquiring branded \nbusinesses in attractive industries with substantial long-\nterm growth potential. Textron operates several inde-\npendent businesses, including Textron Aviation (Cessna, \nBeechcraft), Bell (helicopters), Textron Systems (national \ndefense), Textron Industrial (Arctic Cat, Cushman), and \nFinance.89 Leaders of these businesses are responsible for \neffectively guiding the day-to-day competitive actions of \ntheir units. Consistent with the mandates of the competi-\ntive form of the multidivisional structure, “Textron’s Cor-\nporate Office provides oversight, direction, and assistance \nto its businesses.”90 The profit earned by individual busi-\nness units within Textron is an important measure the \nfirm uses to decide future capital allocations.\nTo emphasize competitiveness among divisions, the \nheadquarters office maintains an arm’s-length relation-\nship with them, intervening in divisional affairs only to \naudit operations and discipline managers whose divisions \nperform poorly.

The headquarters office then allo-\ncates cash flow on a competitive basis, rather than automatically returning cash to the division that \nproduced it. Thus, the focus of the headquarters’ work is on performance appraisal, resource allocation, \nand long-range planning to verify that the firm’s portfolio of businesses will lead to financial success.\nAs is the case with the related linked diversification strategy, investors and shareholders find it chal-\nlenging to understand the underlying value of the set of business units associated with a firm imple-\nmenting the unrelated diversification strategy. Because of this challenge, upper-level managers must \nfind effective ways of communicating their firm’s underlying value to those investing capital in the firm.\nThe three major forms of the multidivisional structure should each be paired with a particular \ncorporate-level strategy. Table 11.1 shows these structures’ characteristics. Differences exist in the \ndegree of centralization, the focus of the performance evaluation, the horizontal structures (integrat-\ning mechanisms), and the incentive compensation schemes. The most centralized and most costly \nstructural form is the cooperative structure. The least centralized, with the lowest bureaucratic costs, \nis the competitive structure. The SBU structure requires partial centralization and involves some of \nthe mechanisms necessary to implement the relatedness between divisions. Also, the divisional incen-\ntive compensation awards are allocated according to both SBUs and corporate performance.\n11-7 Matches between International Strategies \nand Worldwide Structure\nIn Chapter 8, we explained that international strategies are increasingly important for companies’ \nlong-term competitive success in what is today virtually a borderless global economy.91 Among \nother benefits, firms can search for new markets and then form the competencies necessary to \nserve them when implementing an international strategy.92\nAs with business-level and corporate-level strategies, unique organizational structures are nec-\nessary to successfully implement individual international strategies, given the different cultural, \ninstitutional, and legal environments around the world.93 Forming proper matches between inter-\nnational strategies and organizational structures facilitates the firm’s efforts to effectively coordi-\nnate and control its global operations. Research findings confirm the validity of the international \nstrategy/structure matches we discuss here.94\n11-7a Using the Worldwide Geographic Area Structure to \nImplement the Multidomestic Strategy\nThe multidomestic strategy decentralizes the firm’s strategic and operating decisions to business \nunits in each country so that product characteristics can be tailored to local preferences.95 Firms \nusing this strategy try to isolate themselves from global competitive forces by establishing protected \nLearning Objective\n11-7 Discuss the \norganizational structures \nused to implement three \ninternational strategies.\nStructural Characteristics\nOverall Structural Form\nCooperative M-Form (Related \nConstrained Strategy)\nSBU M-Form (Related  \nLinked Strategy)\nCompetitive M-Form (Unrelated \nDiversification Strategy)\nCentralization of  \noperations\nCentralized at corporate \noffice\nPartially centralized (in SBUs)\nDecentralized to divisions\nUse of integration  \nmechanisms\nExtensive\nModerate\nNonexistent\nDivisional performance  \nevaluation\nEmphasizes subjective  \n(strategic) criteria\nUses a mixture of subjective \n(strategic) and objective  \n(financial) criteria\nEmphasizes objective  \n(financial) criteria\nDivisional incentive  \ncompensation\nLinked to overall corporate \nperformance\nMixed linkage to corporate, SBU, \nand divisional performance\nLinked to divisional  \nperformance\nTable 11.1  Characteristics of the Structures Necessary to Implement the Related Constrained, Related Linked, and  \nUnrelated Diversification Strategies\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The worldwide geographic area structure emphasizes national interests and facil-\nitates the firm’s efforts to satisfy local differences (see Figure 11.9). Consequently, it is well suited \nto implementing a multidomestic strategy. Using the multidomestic strategy requires little coor-\ndination between different country markets, meaning that formal integrating mechanisms among \ndivisions around the world are not needed. Indeed, whatever coordination among units in a firm’s \nworldwide geographic area structure does take place tends to be informal.\nFrom a historical perspective, we note that the multidomestic strategy/worldwide geographic area \nstructure match evolved as a natural outgrowth of the multicultural European marketplace. Friends \nand family members of the main business who were sent as expatriates to foreign countries to develop \nthe independent country subsidiary often adopted the worldwide geographic area structure. The rela-\ntionship to corporate headquarters by divisions took place through informal communication.\nFounded in San Francisco, CA, in 2009, Uber Technologies, Inc. has pursued a multidomestic \nstructure. As of 2022, Uber operates in more than 10,000 cities in 71 countries.96 Although it has \nbeen countered by rival Lyft, especially in the United States, Uber remains the market leader. Uber \npursued an aggressive strategy to grow rapidly outside its U.S. home market. However, it often \nflouted local country regulations in the process, leading to local rivals gaining strength. Although it \ntargeted key markets in Asia, it ultimately had to cede its strategy to local rivals, ceding ownership \nin its Russian, Chinese, and Southeast Asian businesses as it sought to focus on its core markets. It \nis also under scrutiny for gender discrimination in the United States. Its aggressive tactics led to the \nreplacement of its founding CEO, Travis Kalanick, with Dara Khosrowshahi.97\nThere is a key challenge associated with effectively using the multidomestic strategy/ worldwide \ngeographic area structure match—namely, the inability to create global efficiencies. This inability is \na product of companies’ focus on serving unique customer needs particularly well. The inability to \ncreate global efficiencies in this match challenges firms to find ways to control costs while trying to \nserve local customers’ unique needs.\nIt seems that creating global efficiencies has been a problem for Uber; it has been unable to deal \nwith big differences in regulations around the globe as well as with local firms that were imitating \nUber’s strategy successfully. By the same token, if the firm can continue to identify and serve the \nunique needs of customers in different markets in ways that create value for them, being unable to \ndevelop scale economics will not be a fatal blow to Uber’s efforts to succeed in international markets. \nThe worldwide geographic \narea structure emphasizes \nnational interests and \nfacilitates the firm’s efforts to \nsatisfy local differences.\nFigure 11.9 Worldwide Geographic Area Structure for Implementing a Multidomestic Strategy\nMultinational\nHeadquarters\nEurope\nLatin\nAmerica\nAsia\nUnited\nStates\nAustralia\nMiddle\nEast/\nAfrica\nNotes:\n• \nThe perimeter circles indicate decentralization of operations.\n• \nEmphasis is on differentiation by local demand to fit an area or country culture.\n• \nCorporate headquarters coordinates financial resources among independent subsidiaries.\n• \nThe organization is like a decentralized federation.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In the worldwide \nproduct divisional structure, decision-making authority is centralized in the worldwide division \nheadquarters to coordinate and integrate decisions and actions among divisional business units \n(see Figure 11.10).\nIntegrating mechanisms are important to the effective use of the worldwide product divisional \nstructure. Direct contact between managers, liaison roles between departments, and both tempo-\nrary task forces and permanent teams are examples of these mechanisms. The disadvantages of the \nglobal strategy/worldwide structure combination are the difficulties involved with coordinating \ndecisions and actions across country borders and the inability to quickly respond to local needs and \npreferences. To deal with these types of disadvantages, firms sometimes choose to try to somewhat \nsimultaneously focus on geography and products. This simultaneous focus is like the combination \nstructure that we discuss next.\n11-7c Using the Combination Structure to Implement the \nTransnational Strategy\nThe transnational strategy calls for the firm to combine the multidomestic strategy’s local respon-\nsiveness with the global strategy’s efficiency. Firms using this strategy are trying to gain the \nadvantages of both local responsiveness and global efficiency.99 The combination structure is \nused to implement the transnational strategy. The combination structure is a structure drawing \nIn the worldwide product \ndivisional structure, \ndecision-making authority is \ncentralized in the worldwide \ndivision headquarters to \ncoordinate and integrate \ndecisions and actions among \ndivisional business units.\nThe combination \nstructure is a structure \ndrawing characteristics and \nmechanisms from both the \nworldwide geographic area \nstructure and the worldwide \nproduct divisional structure.\nFigure 11.10 Worldwide Product Divisional Structure for Implementing a Global Strategy\nGlobal\nCorporate\nHeadquarters\nWorldwide\nProducts\nDivision\nWorldwide\nProducts\nDivision\nWorldwide\nProducts\nDivision\nWorldwide\nProducts\nDivision\nWorldwide\nProducts\nDivision\nWorldwide\nProducts\nDivision\nNotes:\n• The “headquarters” circle indicates centralization to coordinate information flow among worldwide products.\n•  Corporate headquarters uses many intercoordination devices to facilitate global economies of scale and scope.\n• Corporate headquarters also allocates financial resources in a cooperative way.\n• The organization is like a centralized federation.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The transnational strategy is often implemented through two \npossible combination structures: a global matrix structure and a hybrid global design.100 Because \nof its flexibility, a hybrid design is particularly useful in an environment characterized by a high \nlevel of uncertainty.101\nThe global matrix design brings together both local market and product expertise into teams \nthat develop and respond to the global marketplace. The global matrix design promotes flexibility \nin designing products in response to customer needs. However, it has severe limitations in that it \nplaces employees in a position of being accountable to more than one manager. At any given time, \nan employee may be a member of several functional or product group teams. Relationships that \nevolve from multiple memberships can make it difficult for employees to be simultaneously loyal to \nall of them. Although the matrix places authority in the hands of the managers who are most able \nto use it, it creates problems regarding corporate reporting relationships that are so complex and \nvague that it is difficult and time-consuming to receive approval for major decisions.\nWe illustrate the hybrid structure in Figure 11.11. In this design, some divisions are oriented \ntoward products while others are oriented toward market areas. Thus, in cases when the geographic \narea is more important, the division managers are area oriented. In other divisions where world-\nwide product coordination and efficiencies are more important, the division manager is more \nproduct oriented.\nThe fit between the multidomestic strategy and the worldwide geographic area structure \nand between the global strategy and the worldwide product divisional structure is apparent. \nHowever, when a firm wants to implement the multidomestic and global strategies simultane-\nously through a combination structure, the appropriate integrating mechanisms are less obvious. \nThe structure used to implement the transnational strategy must be simultaneously centralized \nand decentralized, integrated and nonintegrated, formalized and nonformalized. Sometimes the \nstructure becomes extremely complex, a reality that challenges managers to remain vigilant in \nefforts to verify that the hybrid structure is effectively supporting use of their firm’s transnational \nstrategy.\nFMC Subsea—a supplier to oil companies around the world that develop marine oil fields—was \na division of FMC Technologies, a U.S. technology firm, which merged with the French engineering  \nfirm Technip in 2017. FMC Subsea was the largest division of FMC Technologies before the merger, \nrepresenting about 66 percent of total revenues, and operated as an independent subsidiary. The \nprimary purpose of a subsea “tree” is to control the flow of oil or gas out of a well on the seabed. \nFMC Subsea is the market leader and has the largest installed base of subsea trees (around 2,000) \nof all companies operating in this market. The initial challenge was to establish an organization \nthat could serve international markets and adapt to local and regional customer requirements. \nAs such, a multidomestic structure was chosen. However, the company experienced challenges in \nimproving cost effectiveness—as noted above, often a problem with the multidomestic strategy. \nTo overcome the problems, a combination strategy with a matrix structure was chosen with dual \nreporting for both geographic market and product units.102\nFigure 11.11 Hybrid Form of the Combination Structure for Implementing a Transnational Strategy\nHeadquarters\nProduct\nDivision A\nArea 2\nArea 1\nArea 2\nArea 1\nProduct\nDivision B\nProduct B\nProduct B\nProduct A\nProduct A\nGeographic\nArea\nDivision 1\nGeographic\nArea\nDivision 2\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

When a firm becomes involved with combina-\ntions of cooperative relationships, it is part of a strategic network, or what others call an alliance \nconstellation or portfolio.105\nA strategic network is a group of firms formed to create value by participating in multiple \ncooperative arrangements.106 An effective strategic network facilitates discovering opportuni-\nties beyond those identified by individual network participants. A strategic network can be a \nsource of competitive advantage for its members when its operations create value that is diffi-\ncult for competitors to duplicate and that network members can’t create by themselves. Strategic \nnetworks are used to implement business-level, corporate-level, and international cooperative \nstrategies. Research has shown that the highest performing strategic networks are young and \nuse a combination of governance based on both relationships (e.g., relational governance) and \nformal rules (e.g., formal governance). Larger and older networks have high levels of relational \ngovernance and low levels of formal governance; however, firms in these networks do not benefit \nas much as firms in younger networks.107\nThe typical strategic network is a loose federation of partners with flexible participation in \nthe network’s operations. At the core or center of the strategic network, the strategic center firm \nis the one around which the network’s cooperative relationships revolve (see Figure 11.12).108 \nBecause of its central position, the strategic center firm is the foundation for the strategic net-\nwork’s structure and must ensure that incentives for participating in the network are aligned \nso that network firms have a reason to remain connected.109 Concerned with various aspects \nof organizational structure, such as formal reporting relationships and procedures, the stra-\ntegic center firm manages what are often complex, cooperative interactions among network \npartners. The strategic center firm is engaged in four primary tasks as it manages the strategic \nnetwork and controls its operations.110\nStrategic Outsourcing The strategic center firm outsources and partners with more firms \nthan other network members. At the same time, the strategic center firm requires network partners \nto be more than contractors. Members are expected to find opportunities for the network to create \nvalue through its cooperative work.111\nLearning Objective\n11-8 Explain strategic \nnetworks and digital \nplatform structures, and \nhow strategic center firms \nimplement such structures \nat the business and \ncorporate levels.\nFigure 11.12 A Strategic Network\nStrategic\nCenter\nFirm\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The structural requirement that members \nsubmit formal reports detailing the technology-oriented outcomes of their efforts to the strategic \ncenter firm facilitates this activity.\nRace to Learn The strategic center firm emphasizes that the principal dimensions of compe-\ntition are between value chains and between networks of value chains. Because of these intercon-\nnections, an individual strategic network is only as strong as its weakest value-chain link. With its \ncentralized decision-making authority and responsibility, the strategic center firm guides partici-\npants in efforts to form network-specific competitive advantages. The need for each participant to \nhave capabilities that can be the foundation for the network’s competitive advantages encourages \nfriendly rivalry among participants seeking to develop the skills needed to quickly form new capa-\nbilities that create value for the network.112\nInterestingly, strategic networks are being used more frequently, partly because strategic center \nfirms can execute a strategy that effectively and efficiently links partner firms.113 Improved infor-\nmation systems and communication capabilities (e.g., the Internet) facilitate effective organization \nand use of strategic networks. One of the best illustrations of a network is illustrated in the global \nairline alliances examples in the Strategic Focus.\n11-8a Implementing Digital Platform Structures\nThroughout this book, we have discussed the importance of digital technologies on business and \nthe firm.114 In Chapter 2, we highlighted the increasing importance of digital platforms as a part \nof the sharing economy, a socioeconomic system that uses information technology to link stake-\nholders with each other.115 Chapter 4 discussed digital platforms as a potential business model. \nHere we discuss the implementation of a digital platform structure and how it fits within other \norganizational structures. \nAs defined in Chapter 4, a digital platform is an Internet-based location for exchanges of infor-\nmation, goods, or services to occur between producers, consumers, and other members of the \nplatform community.116 Firms that create and manage platforms can earn revenues through sub-\nscriptions, advertising, fee-per-use, charging a percentage of the value of goods traded (e.g., a com-\nmission), requesting donations (i.e., Wikipedia), or any number of other means. Unlike many of \nthe other structures discussed in this chapter (i.e., simple structure, functional structure), there is \nno natural progression that leads to a platform structure. Some companies, like Uber and Amazon, \nbegan with a digital platform structure. Other companies, like Walmart, created a digital platform \nin response to competitive rivalry. Also note that a digital platform structure is often supplemental \nto the other structures discussed here. For example, a firm could have a functional structure with \na traditional department organization (e.g., finance, R&D, operations, marketing) in support of its \ndigital platform.\nA digital platform is, in essence, a business ecosystem on its own.117 Chapter 2 defined a \nbusiness ecosystem as a complex network of interconnected organizations whose competitive \nand cooperative efforts are associated with satisfying a particular value proposition (i.e., prod-\nuct or service).118 They have less formalization than a traditional organization, and decision \nmaking is almost entirely decentralized (e.g., in the hands of platform participants). However, \nparticipants are more closely tied to each other than would occur in a traditional market. \n“A distinctive feature of the platform architecture is its modular and interdependent system \nof core and complementary components bound together by design rules and an overarching \nvalue proposition.”119 In this sense, the digital platform structure is a lot like the network struc-\nture, with the platform creator playing a role similar to a strategic center firm.120 The platform \ncreator establishes and enforces the rules, and manages transactions among participants, and \nthe effectiveness with which they perform this function has a dramatic effect on the platform’s \nsuccess.121\nBecause digital platforms are Internet-based, they are global by their very nature.122 That is, \npeople around the world could potentially have access to the platform, although the platform \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The advantage of the global \nnature of a digital platform is that the upside market potential is huge. However, it also pres-\nents challenges associated with differences in language, culture, and government regulations. \nEven regional differences within the same country can make a difference.123 Consequently, \nplatform creators tend to focus on a specific market first, but then open their platforms later \nto achieve higher levels of sales growth.124\n11-8b Implementing Business-Level Cooperative Strategies\nAs explained in Chapter 9, there are two types of business-level complementary alliances—\nvertical and horizontal. Firms with competencies in different stages of the value chain form a \nvertical alliance to cooperatively integrate their different, but complementary, skills.125 Firms \ncombining their competencies to create value in the same stage of the value chain are using a \nhorizontal alliance.126 Vertical complementary strategic alliances are formed more frequently \nthan horizontal alliances.127\nA strategic network of vertical relationships, such as the network in Japan between Toyota \nand its suppliers, often involves several implementation issues.128 First, the strategic center firm \nencourages subcontractors to modernize their facilities and provides them with technical and \nfinancial assistance to do so, if necessary. Second, the strategic center firm reduces its transac-\ntion costs by promoting longer-term contracts with subcontractors so that supplier-partners \nincrease their long-term productivity. This approach differs from that of continually negotiat-\ning short-term contracts based on unit pricing. Third, the strategic center firm enables engi-\nneers in upstream companies (suppliers) to have better communications with those companies \nwith whom it has contracts for services. As a result, suppliers and the strategic center firm \nbecome more interdependent and less independent.\nThe lean production system (a vertical complementary strategic alliance) pioneered by \nToyota and others has been diffused throughout many industries.129 In vertical complemen-\ntary strategic alliances, such as the one between Toyota and its suppliers, the strategic center \nfirm is obvious, as is the structure that firm establishes. However, the same is not always true \nwith horizontal complementary strategic alliances where firms try to create value in the same \npart of the value chain. For example, airline alliances are commonly formed to create value in \nthe marketing and sales primary activity segment of the value chain. There are three major  \nalliances—Star Alliance (26 members), SkyTeam (19 members), and Oneworld (14 members)—\nand each of them include multiple large airlines.130 In this case, it is unclear who is the strategic \ncenter firm. In addition, in large alliances, it is often difficult to determine the contributions \nof each alliance partner.131\nAlso, if rivals band together in too many collaborative activities, one or more governments \nmay suspect the possibility of explicit collusion among partnering firms (see Chapter 9). In \nfact, the airline alliances have been accused of fixing prices.132 For these reasons, horizontal \ncomplementary alliances are used less often and less successfully than their vertical counter-\npart, although there are examples of success, such as some of the collaborations among auto-\nmobile and aircraft manufacturers.\n11-8c Implementing Corporate-Level Cooperative Strategies\nSome corporate-level strategies are used to reduce costs. This was the objective with the col-\nlaboration that Walgreens and Swiss-based Alliance Boots, a pharmacy-led health and beauty \ngroup, initially formed. This partnership helped the firms negotiate lower prices with drug \nsuppliers, reducing their overall costs as a result. Of course, the alliance eventually turned \ninto a holding company that owns the Walgreens and Boots pharmacy chains, as well as an \nassortment of pharmaceutical companies. Walgreens Boots Alliance was ranked as number 16 \non Fortune’s list of the 500 largest companies in 2021 and is now one of the companies making \nup the Dow Jones Industrial Average.133 \nUnilever is partnering with some firms to reach a different objective. Committed to decou-\npling its growth from negative environmental and social effects from its operations, Unile-\nver formed an alliance with Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. in 2010 to reduce the company’s \ncarbon, water, and waste footprint across its manufacturing locations throughout the world. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Even as 5G technol-\nogy was being introduced, companies such as Samsung were start-\ning to develop 6G technology. It takes about 10 years from the very \nbeginning of research to full commercialization of a new generation \nof wireless technology. According to Sunghyun Choi, head of the \nAdvanced Communications Research Center, “Going forward, we \nare committed to leading the standardization of 6G in collaboration \nwith various stakeholders across industry, academia, and government \nfields.” To make 6G viable, terahertz (THz) frequencies are likely to be \nnecessary. These would require new antenna technologies, spectrum \nsharing, advanced duplex technologies, and artificial intelligence.\nTo develop 6G, collaboration took the form of a massive  \ncorporate-level cooperative strategy involving many companies. \nThe “Next G Alliance” includes AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Facebook, \nMicrosoft, Bell Canada, Finland-based Nokia and Sweden-based \nEriccson, South Korea’s Samsung, and the U.S. Department of \nDefense, among many others. China’s Huawei was not allowed \nto join as a founding member because the U.S. government had \nbanned it from federal contracts. Lee Ki-dong, a senior researcher \nfrom LG Electronics, was selected to lead the alliance’s applications \nworking group. \nSusan Miller, president and CEO of the Alliance for \nTelecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), the organization \nthat facilitated creation of the Next G Alliance, said, “an important \ngoal of the alliance is to influence the U.S. government’s funding \npriorities and actions that can incentivize the communications \ntechnology industry. We think that’s part of laying the ground-\nwork for a very vibrant marketplace.” The alliance also seeks to lay \nout a 6G roadmap to address the changing competitive landscape, \nestablish priorities to steer leadership for 6G and future genera-\ntions of technology, and identify early steps that will lead to rapid \ncommercialization and encourage widescale adoption of the \ntechnology.\nSome of the advanced multimedia services being discussed \nfor 6G include “truly immersive extended reality (XR), mobile holo-\ngrams, and digital replicas.” To do this, transfer speeds will need to \nbe increased from 20 Gbps (gigabits per second) associated with \n5G to about 1,000 Gbps. In May 2022, the alliance, under the lead-\nership of ATIS and Informa Tech, held a summit in Austin, Texas, to \ndiscuss advances in 6G technology. Says Miller, “The 6G Summit \nprovides an opportunity to hear from leading Next G Alliance and \nother industry experts shaping the future of mobile technology.”\nSources: M.

As a cooperative strategy, franchising allows the firm to \nuse its competencies to extend or diversify its product or market reach without completing a \nmerger or acquisition.134\nThe potential to create synergy is a key reason corporate-level cooperative strategies, such \nas those involving Walgreens and Unilever are formed. McDonald’s also seeks synergy through \nits franchise structure.135 Historically, McDonald’s approach to franchising as a corporate-level \ncooperative strategy found the firm emphasizing a limited value-priced menu. However, the \nfirm’s structure is being changed. One objective of these structural changes is to strip out sig-\nnificant firm costs. Overall, McDonald’s headquarters serves as the strategic center firm for the \nnetwork’s franchisees. The headquarters office uses strategic and financial controls to verify \nthat the franchisees’ operations create the greatest value for the entire network.136\nAs the Strategic Focus demonstrates, corporate-level cooperative strategies are also formed \nto deal more effectively with emerging technologies. Major firms with a stake in wireless phone \nservice joined forces to usher in 6G and future generations of technology.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Organizational controls guide the \nuse of strategy, indicate how to compare actual and \nexpected results, and suggest actions to take to \nimprove performance when it falls below expecta-\ntions. A proper match between strategy and struc-\nture can lead to a competitive advantage.\n \n● A typical organizational control cycle involves \ndeveloping both strategic and financial objectives \nbased on the strategies that were formulated, \nassigning responsibility, creating a detailed imple-\nmentation plan (including budget and time frame), \nallocation of resources, comparing results with \nobjectives, assessing outcomes, and feeding perti-\nnent information back to decision makers to guide \nthe next control cycle.\n \n● Strategic controls (largely subjective criteria) and \nfinancial controls (largely objective criteria) are the \ntwo types of organizational controls used to support \nthe implementation of a strategy. Both controls are \ncritical, although their degree of emphasis varies \nbased on individual matches between strategy and \nstructure.\n \n● Strategy and structure influence each other; overall, \nthough, strategy has a stronger influence on struc-\nture. Firms tend to change structure when declining \nperformance forces them to do so. Effective managers \nanticipate the need for structural change and quickly \nmodify structure to better accommodate the firm’s \nstrategy.\n \n● The functional structure is used to implement business- \nlevel strategies. The cost leadership strategy requires \na centralized functional structure—one in which \nmanufacturing efficiency and process engineering \nare emphasized. The differentiation strategy’s func-\ntional structure decentralizes implementation-related \nFigure 11.13 A Distributed Strategic Network\nDistributed Strategic Center Firms\nMain\nStrategic\nCenter\nFirm\nStrategic networks formed to implement international cooperative strategies result in firms \ncompeting in several countries.137 Differences among countries’ regulatory environments increase \nthe challenge of managing international networks and verifying that, at a minimum, a network’s \noperations comply with all legal requirements.138\nDistributed strategic networks are the organizational structure used to manage international \ncooperative strategies. As Figure 11.13 shows, several regional strategic center firms are included \nin the distributed network to manage partner firms’ multiple cooperative arrangements.139 The \nstructure used to implement the international cooperative strategy is complex and demands careful \nattention to be used successfully.140\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Focus strategies, often used in small firms, \nrequire a simple structure until such time that the firm \ndiversifies in terms of products and/or markets.\n \n● Unique combinations of different forms of the \nmultidivisional structure are matched with differ-\nent corporate-level diversification strategies to \nproperly implement these strategies. The cooper-\native multidivisional form, used to implement the \nrelated constrained corporate-level strategy, has a \ncentralized corporate office and extensive integrat-\ning mechanisms. Divisional incentives are linked to \noverall corporate performance to foster cooperation \namong divisions. The related linked SBU multidivi-\nsional structure establishes separate profit centers \nwithin the diversified firm. Each profit center or \nSBU may have divisions offering similar products, \nbut the SBUs are often unrelated to each other. The \ncompetitive multidivisional structure, used to imple-\nment the unrelated diversification strategy, is highly \ndecentralized, lacks integrating mechanisms, and \nutilizes objective financial criteria to evaluate each \nunit’s performance.\n \n● The multidomestic strategy, implemented through \nthe worldwide geographic area structure, empha-\nsizes decentralization and locates all functional \nactivities in the host country or geographic area. \nThe worldwide product divisional structure is used \nto implement the global strategy. This structure is \ncentralized to coordinate and integrate different \nfunctions’ activities to gain global economies of \nscope and economies of scale. Decision-making \nauthority is centralized in the firm’s worldwide divi-\nsion headquarters.\n \n● The transnational strategy—a strategy through \nwhich the firm seeks the local responsiveness of the \nmultidomestic strategy and the global efficiency of \nthe global strategy—is implemented through the \ncombination structure. Because it must be simulta-\nneously centralized and decentralized, integrated \nand nonintegrated, and formalized and nonformal-\nized, the combination structure is difficult to orga-\nnize and successfully manage. Two structures can \nbe used to implement the transnational strategy: \nthe matrix and the hybrid structure with both geo-\ngraphic and product-oriented divisions.\n \n● Increasingly important to competitive success, \ncooperative strategies are implemented through \norganizational structures framed around strategic \nnetworks. Strategic center firms play a critical role in \nmanaging strategic networks. Business-level strat-\negies are often employed in vertical and horizontal \nalliance networks. Corporate-level cooperative \nstrategies are used to pursue product and market \ndiversification.\nKey Terms\ncombination structure 296\ncompetitive form 292\ncooperative form 290\nfinancial controls 283\nfunctional structure 285\nmultidivisional structure 285\norganizational controls 281\norganizational structure 280\nsimple structure 284\nstrategic business unit (SBU) form 291\nstrategic controls 282\nworldwide geographic area structure 295\nworldwide product divisional structure 296\nReview Questions\n1.

The resulting company would be \norganized into three business lines—ExxonMobil Upstream \nCompany (oil and gas production), ExxonMobil Product \nSolutions (chemicals and refining), and ExxonMobil Low \nCarbon Solutions. According to CEO Darren Woods, “Our \ntransformed business structure enables us to more fully \nleverage the corporation’s scale, integration, technology \nadvantages, and the skills and capabilities of our talented \nworkforce, to better serve our customers. Aligning our busi-\nnesses along market-focused value chains and centralizing \nservice delivery, provides the flexibility to ensure our most \ncapable resources are applied to the highest corporate prior-\nities and positions us to deliver greater shareholder returns.” \nNo layoffs are anticipated due to the restructuring.\nThe new ExxonMobil Product Solutions Company, to \nbe headed by Karen McKee, is charged with engineering, \nmanufacturing, and delivering new products. This business \nunit will play a big role in reducing carbon emissions and \nplastic waste through new products such as lower-emission \nfuels for commercial transportation (including aviation and \nmarine), chemical performance products that help custom-\ners reduce emission, lubricants and plastics that improve \nautomobile efficiency, and circular polymers that help with \nplastic recycling.\nThe ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions unit “is focused \non lowering Exxon’s carbon emissions and developing emerg-\ning technologies including carbon capture, hydrogen and \nbiofuels.” By putting its low carbon business on the same level \nin the organization as its other two businesses, ExxonMobil \nnow has greater flexibility in allocating resources to efforts \nto help the company adjust to the transition to clean energy. \nThis unit will focus on hard-to-decarbonize industrial sec-\ntors, including commercial transportation, power generation, \nand heavy industry. The company has received interest from \n11 companies “to support large-scale carbon capture and stor-\nage hubs, with the first near Houston.” ExxonMobil believes \nit may be possible to capture 100 million tons of carbon from \nchemical plants, power-generation facilities, and refineries \naround Houston by 2040. Also, ExxonMobil has a goal to \nachieve net-zero emissions from its operations by 2050, with \nspecific plans to be developed by each of its operations.\nThe three business lines will be supported by a single \ntechnology organization called ExxonMobil Technology and \nEngineering, as well as other centralized groups that will \nprovide particular services throughout the organization. This \nmajor restructuring was first envisioned around 2017, accord-\ning to Senior Vice President Jack P. Williams, “It’s an evolu-\ntion. We have been working on it for a while now.” One of \nthe first steps was combining the fuel and lubricants division \nwith supply and refining.\nPreviously implemented structural changes associated \nwith centralization of the procurement function, right- \nsizing programs, and digitally transforming certain processes \nare on track to save the company $6 billion dollars by 2023, \ncompared to 2019. This new structure is expected to save the \ncompany even more, but more importantly, the restructur-\ning is intended to provide higher priority to important areas \nassociated with sustainable business. “ExxonMobil’s restruc-\nturing has put its clean energy operation on equal footing \nwith its traditional oil and gas, refining and petrochemical \noperations.”\nSources: C.

Her path as a leader \ndemonstrates increasing levels of responsibility and decision-making authority while \nmoving from one opportunity to another.\nA graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Business School, Whitman \nstarted her career in 1979 as a brand manager at Procter & Gamble. She later \nworked as a consultant in Bain & Company’s San Francisco office, rising to a  \nposition as senior vice president in this firm. In 1989, she accepted a position as \nvice president for strategic planning at Walt Disney Corporation. She met Jeffrey  \nKatzenberg while working for Disney. After two years, she joined Stride Rite \nCorporation before becoming president and CEO of Florists’ Transworld Delivery \nin 1995. After another two years, she accepted the role of general manager for \nHasbro’s Playskool division, where she had responsibility for global management \nand marketing for two brands targeted to children—Playskool and Mr. Potato \nHead. From Hasbro, \nWhitman became \nCEO of eBay (the \npioneering com-\npany that made it \npossible for strang-\ners to exchange \ngoods online) in \nMarch 1998. At the \ntime, the firm had \nonly 30 employees \nand annual revenue \nof approximately \n$4 million. Before \nresigning as eBay’s \nCEO in November \n2007, the firm’s rev-\nenues had increased \nto $8 billion annual-\nly and the workforce \nnumbered around \n15,000.\nWhitman become \nCEO of Hewlett-Packard \nin September 2011. She \nremained in this role for a little over six years. During those years, “she led a turnaround \nplan that involved the largest split in corporate history, tens of thousands of layoffs,  \n$18 billion in write-offs and a leadership shake-up.” Deciding in 2015 to split Hewlett- \nPackard into Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc. (HPQ) was the most prominent \nstrategic action she took as Hewlett-Packard’s CEO. HP Inc. took the printer and personal \ncomputer businesses, while HPE competes in various markets such as servers, storage, \nnetworking, consulting and support, and financial services. Whitman, her team, and \nHewlett-Packard’s board chose to split into two companies because of declining sales in \nwhat was a complicated organizational structure. The leaders believed that breaking the \nfirm into two units would allow each to focus more on a smaller number of businesses as \na way to unlock their full value. \nAs is the case for virtually all leaders serving as a CEO, Whitman’s career is not without \ncontroversy. During her tenure at eBay, for example, the firm paid roughly $4.1 billion to \nacquire Skype in 2005. Later admitting that the premium she and her team agreed to pay \nfor Skype was too large, eBay sold Skype to a group of investors for $2.75 billion.\nAlso, in Whitman’s view, failing to recognize the market potential for eBay in Japan \nwas a major error. Instead of investing in Japan, Whitman chose to invest in eBay’s  \nexisting website. At the time, Japan was the world’s second-largest Internet consumer \nmarket. In commenting about this matter, Whitman said that “I had a sense that the \ntechnology underpinning eBay was not going to help us scale where we needed to. \nThat miss of eBay Japan is one of the big failures of my time at eBay.” \n© anilakkus / Getty Images\nImaginechina Limited/Alamy Stock Photo\nMeg Whitman, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, led the turnaround \nplan to split HP into two companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprises \n(HPE) and Hewlett Packard Inc.

Now, her successor Antonio Neri must take the remnants \nand reignite innovation.” Others observed the continuing weakness in server sales at Hewlett \nPackard Enterprise as Whitman departed, suggesting that she was at least partly responsible \nfor this situation. \nAfter Whitman stepped down from her CEO position at Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. in \n2018, she said she was returning to what she considers her “start-up roots.” She had decided to \njoin with Hollywood executive and long-time friend Jeffrey Katzenberg to run a mobile-video \ncompany called WndrCo NewTV. This firm was part of Katzenberg’s WndrCo LLC, a media and \ntech venture that plans to develop a portfolio of companies. The intention was to build “an \nonline service, securing production partnerships and building a team at NewTV, which will \ntarget the 18- to 34-year-olds who have driven the rise in mobile-video viewing over the past \nseveral years.” The resulting video platform, called Quibi, was shut down October 2020, only \nseven months after it launched.\nWhitman currently holds seats on the boards of Procter & Gamble and Dropbox. She also \ninvested in a Los Angeles e-sports company called Immortals LLC and sits on their board. Her \nvast executive experience can be of immense benefit to the managers and other board mem-\nbers in all those organizations. \nLike virtually all high-profile business leaders, Whitman’s career has seen ups and downs; \nhowever, many view Whitman as a leader who played a major role in commercializing the \nInternet industry. In doing so, she also amassed a personal fortune worth an estimated $3.2 \nbillion. In December 2021, it was announced that Whitman was nominated by President Joe \nBiden to serve as ambassador to Kenya.\nSources: 2022, Meg Whitman, Forbes, www.forbes.com, May 10; B.

Meg Whitman is a strategic leader \nwho has taken strategic actions in each managerial position she held to deal with challenging sit-\nuations in the pursuit of helping firms earn above-average returns. Sometimes, though, for many \nreasons, strategic leaders do not attain the level of success they desire. Even Whitman had her share \nof disappointments. \nRegardless of the length of their tenure, strategic leaders’ decisions and actions affect a firm’s \nperformance. Many—though not all—thought Steve Jobs was the primary catalyst in driving Apple \nto significant levels of success as the firm’s CEO. There were questions about whether anyone could \nfollow Jobs as CEO and come close to achieving his levels of success. Those questions dogged Tim \nCook, who became Apple’s CEO after Jobs passed away. Concerns about Cook may have been \nunnecessary. Since 2011, when Cook took over the CEO job, Apple’s fiscal year revenues have \ngrown from $108 billion to $366 billion. Net income for fiscal year 2021 was over $94 billion.1 \nAs CEOs work with others to carry out strategic analysis leading to the development of effective \nstrategies and their implementation, the firm is much more likely to achieve strategic competitive-\nness and above-average returns (e.g., the A-S-P model introduced in Chapter 1). We show how \neffective strategic leadership makes this possible in Figure 12.1.2\nIn this chapter, we first define strategic leadership and discuss its importance and the possibility \nof strategic leaders as a source of competitive advantage. These introductory comments include a \nbrief consideration of different styles strategic leaders may use. We then examine the role of top-\nlevel managers and top management teams and their effects on innovation, strategic change, and \nLearning Objective\n12-1 Define strategic \nleadership and describe \ntop-level managers’ \nimportance.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Following this discussion is an analysis of managerial succession, particularly in \nthe context of the internal and external managerial labor markets from which firms select strategic \nleaders. Closing the chapter are descriptions of five key leadership actions that contribute to effec-\ntive strategic leadership: determining strategic direction, effectively managing the firm’s resource \nportfolio, sustaining an effective organizational culture, emphasizing ethical practices, and estab-\nlishing balanced organizational controls.\n12-1a Strategic Leadership and Strategic Change\nStrategic leadership is the ability to anticipate, envision, maintain flexibility, and empower others \nto create strategic change as necessary.3 Strategic change is change resulting from selecting and \nimplementing a firm’s strategies.4 Strategic leaders promote strategic change by managing through \nothers, managing an entire organization rather than a functional subunit, and coping with the \nrapid and intense changes associated with the global economy. Because of the global economy’s \ncomplexity, strategic leaders must learn how to influence human behavior effectively, often in \nuncertain environments.5 By word and by personal example, and through their ability to envision \nthe future, effective strategic leaders meaningfully influence the behaviors, thoughts, and feelings \nof those with whom they work.6\nThe Strategic Focus illustrates a lot of the points we have discussed thus far. The influence of  \nStarbucks’ founder Howard Schultz on the company is legendary, and he has returned as CEO twice to \nguide the company through significant challenges since he originally stepped down from the position.\nStrategic leadership is the \nability to anticipate, envision, \nmaintain flexibility, and \nempower others to create \nstrategic change as necessary.\nStrategic change is change \nresulting from selecting \nand implementing a firm’s \nstrategies.\nFigure 12.1 Strategic Leadership and the Strategic Management Process\nVision\nMission\nValues\nFormulation\nof Strategies\nImplementation\nof Strategies\nStrategic\nCompetitiveness\nAbove-Average Returns\ninfluence\nshapes the\nformation of\nEffective Strategic\nLeadership\nyields\nyields\nSuccessful\nStrategic Actions\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

He bought out his local Starbucks in 1987 and began \nmaking changes to the company to improve its image and customer \nexperience. He provided benefits to workers that were unusual in the \nrestaurant industry, including health benefits for part-time workers. \nWhen the company went public in 1992, employees began receiv-\ning stock. Schultz also treated employees with great respect, holding \ntown-hall style meetings with them and listening to their concerns. \nStarbucks has grown rapidly on a global scale since the company \nwent public, achieving revenues of $29 billion in fiscal 2021. The \ncompany still has aggressive growth objectives, including opening \n20,000 more cafes globally by 2030. This growth would mean a total \nof approximately 55,000 stores.\nSchultz served as CEO from 1987 to 2000 and then returned \nto serve as CEO in 2008 to help guide Starbucks out of the Great \nRecession. Kevin Johnson became CEO in 2017. He could have had \nno idea what was brewing when he took over the top spot. Indeed, \nrestaurants were one of the worst hit businesses during the COVID-19 \npandemic.\nOne of the huge problems plaguing restaurant operators in \nthe United States in 2021 was a shortage of workers. In fact, the \nwhole hospitality industry was experiencing worker shortages and \nhigh turnover. This situation led to staffing shortages and more \nstress on the remaining employees. During this crisis, and possibly \nas a response to it, almost 140 stores in 26 states decided to hold  \nelections regarding union organization. Another force causing the \ntrend toward unionization was that the job of a barista had changed \ndramatically due to changes in the way consumers were buying \ncoffee from Starbucks. Approximately 70 percent of all orders in the \nUnited States had become takeout orders, and the job of a barista \nwas now complicated by drive-through windows and mobile orders. \nAlthough Starbucks announced an increase in barista pay, some \nshareholders were very upset about the way the company handled \nthe unionization drive, and the stock suffered. \nIn November 2021, as employees were considering forming a union, \nSchultz traveled to Buffalo, New York, to deliver a message encouraging \nthem to work with management and telling them that the company \nwould best protect employees’ interests. He said, “Our core purpose and \nreason for being is to build the kind of company that creates a fragile \nbalance between profit and doing the right thing.” However, they voted \nto organize anyway, claiming that union representation is needed to \nachieve higher pay, adequate staffing, and a stronger voice about how \nthe company is managed. It is also significant that a Seattle store voted \nto unionize—this is Starbucks’ hometown.\nIn 2021, Johnson that he would retire the next year. After Johnson \nannounced his retirement, “Starbucks’ board presumably had a year \nto find Johnson’s successor, and they weren’t able to find the right \nperson,” according to Pat Petitti, CEO of consulting firm Catalant. In \naddition to the unionization movement and a void in leadership at the \ntop, Starbucks was facing rising prices and serious problems in some \nof its foreign markets (i.e., China due to pandemic-related lockdowns \nand Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine). During this crisis, Schultz, \nat 68 years old, agreed to return as CEO of Starbucks in April 2022, his \nthird time in that office. The stock market responded positively to the \nannouncement by bidding up the price of the stock by about 8 per-\ncent in less than a week. Schultz intends to establish a new tone with \nthe company’s 230,000 workers in its U.S. coffee houses. “We have to \ntake a hard look at how we are doing as a company, and as a commu-\nnity of partners.” He wants to “revamp” the company.\nHow much of a difference will Schultz make as the returning CEO? \nStarbucks Chairwoman Mellody Hobson expressed the sentiment that \nthis appointment would be temporary and announced that a replace-\nment would be announced by fall 2022. This timeline was difficult. \n“Schultz is widely credited with building Starbucks’ reputation as a good \nplace to work—a reputation that influences investors, customers, and \npotential employees. As executive chairman, he has been involved in \nthe company’s efforts to persuade workers not to unionize. But the bil-\nlionaire exec seems to have retained a wide base of support in the rank \nand file—and whoever follows him may need the same.” Meanwhile, \nall eyes are on Howard Schultz. “On his first day back as Starbucks Corp. \nchief executive, Howard Schultz suspended billions of dollars in share \nrepurchases and said his immediate focus would be on cafes, custom-\ners and employees, rather than the stock market.” \nSources: H.

This environment is \nwhat Schultz is trying to achieve as he reinvents Starbucks. The ability to attract and manage human \ncapital and establish and nurture an appropriate context for that capital to flourish is critical to stra-\ntegic leadership.7 We also need to remember that the intellectual capital the firm possesses resides \nin the firm’s human capital, so a firm’s ability to produce innovations has much to do with the \nability to retain (and manage) key employees, and this ultimately affects a strategic leader’s success.8\nThe primary responsibility for effective strategic leadership rests at the top of the organization, \nand in particular with the CEO. Other strategic leaders include members of the board of directors, \nthe top management team, and divisional general managers. In practice though, any individual \nwith responsibility for the performance of human capital and/or a part of the firm (e.g., a produc-\ntion unit) is a strategic leader. Regardless of their title and organizational function, strategic leaders \nhave substantial decision-making responsibilities they cannot delegate.9 Strategic leadership is a \ncomplex but critical form of leadership. Without effective strategic leaders, firms fail in efforts to \nimplement strategies in ways that lead to above-average returns.\n12-1b Leadership Personality and Style\nStrategy formulation and implementation are the result of human enterprise.10 The top managers \nthat guide these processes exhibit human characteristics, including interpretations, biases, fatigue, \njealousies, and talents.11 Consequently, researchers have investigated how the human characteristics \nof top managers influence their decisions.12 For example, CEOs with a higher risk propensity are \nmore likely to steer their firms toward higher levels of internationalization and riskier locations.13\nTwo areas of particular interest are personality traits and leadership style.14 Researchers have \nfound that the personality traits of CEOs have an influence on their style of leadership and, ulti-\nmately, on firm outcomes and value creation. For example, based on a study of the personality traits \nof nearly 3,000 CEOs, researchers found that levels of neuroticism (emotional instability), consci-\nentiousness (thoughtfulness, goal-directed), and extraversion (energized around people, talkative) \ninfluence the perceived riskiness of a firm, as measure through the volatility of its stock.15 One \ninteresting outcome of this research is that the expected relationship between the risk and returns \nfrom a particular firm’s stock may be either positive (riskier stocks provide higher returns) or neg-\native (riskier stocks provide lower returns), depending on the personality of the CEO. \nAlso, researchers have discovered that the personality of the CEO can have a meaningful impact \non strategic change.16 They found higher levels of strategic change in firms in which the CEO has \na personality associated with openness (imagination and insight), which is another of the most \nimportant personality characteristics. The bottom line in these studies is that personal characteris-\ntics of the CEO, such as personality and leadership style, matter in terms of the firm’s ability to carry \nout its strategies and achieve high returns.\nIn addition to personality, a top manager’s leadership style is influenced by their personal ide-\nology and experience.17 Consider Aziz Hasan, former CEO of Kickstarter, a funding platform. In a \nletter to shareholders, Hasan explained that the company has made commitments to support social \ncauses. To support equality, the ratio of his pay to the median pay of a Kickstarter employee is 2.8 to 1 \n(compared with 320 to 1 at a typical company). In another example, Kickstarter has encouraged users \nto detail their own environmental commitments in their project pages, and about half have done so.18 \nWith regard to experience, consider Amy Howe, who in 2021 was appointed chief executive of Flutter \nEntertainment PLC, a global gambling operator. She has an aggressive management style, and expe-\nrience in modernizing and growing businesses. “At Ticketmaster, as global chief operating officer,  \nMs. Howe led a modernization of the company’s ticket platform and grew its mobile app customer \nbase by 400% according to a statement from Flutter.”19 This experience and her leadership style make \nAmy an excellent choice for leading an expansion of Flutter Entertainment.\nGiven that both Aziz Hassan and Amy Howe have such a strong influence on culture and employee \nperspectives in their respective companies, they may be considered transformational leaders. Transfor-\nmational leadership is one of the most effective strategic leadership styles. It entails motivating follow-\ners to exceed the expectations others have of them, to strengthen their capabilities through continuous \ntraining, and to place the interests of the organization above their own.20 This is certainly manifest in \nthe relatively low salary of Aziz Hassan at Kickstarter. Transformational leaders develop and commu-\nnicate an organizational vision and work with others to formulate and execute a strategy to achieve it. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Emotionally intelligent leaders \nunderstand themselves well, have strong motivation, empathize with others, and have effective \ninterpersonal skills.21 These characteristics contribute to transformational leaders’ efforts to pro-\nmote and nurture innovation in firms.22\n12-1c Top-Level Managers and Managerial Discretion\nIn their role, top-level managers make many decisions, such as the strategic actions and responses \nassociated with their firm’s competitive rivalries (see Chapter 5). When making decisions related \nto using the strategic management process, managers often use their discretion (or latitude for \naction).23 “To understand the implications of strategic leadership for organizations and their stake-\nholders, it is necessary to first consider the extent to which corporate leaders can meaningfully \ninfluence firm strategy and, by extension, firm performance.”24\nManagerial discretion differs among managers leading firms in different industries. Because \nstrategic leaders make decisions to help the firm outperform competitors, how they exercise dis-\ncretion when making decisions is critical to the firm’s success and influences its culture as well.25 \nThe primary factors that determine the amount of decision-making discretion a manager has \n(especially a top-level manager) are:\n1. external environmental sources such as industry structure, the rate of market growth in the \nfirm’s primary industry, and the degree to which product differentiation is possible\n2. organizational characteristics, including size, age, resources, governance, and culture\n3. managerial characteristics, including commitment to the firm, tolerance for ambiguity, skills in \nworking with different people, and aspiration levels (see Figure 12.2).\nFigure 12.2 Factors Affecting Managerial Discretion\nManagerial\nDiscretion\nCharacteristics of\nthe Manager\n•  Tolerance for ambiguity\n•  Commitment to the\n   firm and its desired\n   strategic outcomes\n•  Interpersonal skills\n•  Aspiration level\n•  Degree of self-\n   confidence\nExternal Environment\n•  Industry structure\n•  Rate of market growth\n•  Number and type of\n    competitors\n•  Nature and degree of\n    political/legal\n constraints\n•  Degree to which\n products can be\n    differentiated\nCharacteristics of the\nOrganization\n•  Size\n•  Age\n•  Culture\n•  Availability of\n   resources\n•  Patterns of interaction\n   among employees\nSource: Adapted from S.

Consequently, top management teams (TMTs), rather than a single top-level manager, \nare involved in this function.26 “The interest in TMTs is due to the fact that it is not just the CEO, \nbut also executives who report to the CEO who are responsible for the strategic and operational \ndecisions that ultimately determine firm outcomes.”27A top management team (TMT) is composed \nof the individuals responsible for making certain the firm uses the strategic management pro-\ncess, especially to select and implement strategies. Typically, the top management team includes \nthe officers of the corporation, defined by the title of vice president and above or by service as \na member of the board of directors. Among other outcomes, the quality of a top management \nteam’s decisions affects the firm’s ability to innovate and change in ways that help its efforts to earn \nabove-average returns.28\n12-2a Power Dynamics at the Top of the Organization\nAlthough the complex challenges facing most organizations require the exercise of strategic lead-\nership by a team of executives rather than by a single individual, using a team to make decisions \nabout how the firm will compete also helps to avoid another potential problem when CEOs make \ndecisions in isolation: managerial hubris.29 Research shows that when CEOs begin to believe glow-\ning press accounts and to feel that they are unlikely to make errors, the quality of their decisions \nsuffers.30 Top-level managers should be self-confident, but they must not allow that to become \narrogance, possibly leading to a false belief in their own invincibility.31 An effective TMT can help \nguard against CEO hubris and the making of poor decisions. However, some TMTs do not func-\ntion well. For example, they may not meet very often (or not at all) or they may be highly frag-\nmented.32 In this sense, they are not a team at all, but a group of disconnected high-level managers \nthat perform specific functions within the firm.\nOf course, the board of directors also performs an important function in limiting the discretion \nof the CEO and overcoming the potential for hubris. However, the power dynamic between CEOs \nand boards can be very different from one firm to another. Often the CEO has nominated several \nof the directors to the board, and they may be close friends or business partners. In other cases, an \nindividual holds both the CEO position and chairs the board, a situation called CEO duality.33 As \nmentioned in Chapter 10, a CEO who also chairs the board is going to have even more power than \na CEO who does not. This situation can, but doesn’t always, create agency problems.34 A CEO who \ndesires to be the best possible steward of the firm’s assets gains efficiency through CEO duality.35 In \naddition, because of this person’s positive orientation and actions, extra governance and the coor-\ndination costs resulting from an independent board leadership structure become less necessary.36\n \nIn the optimal situation, the TMT and board of directors provide wise advice to the CEO \nthat leads to good strategic decisions, and they also prevent the CEO from making unwise decisions \nthat are likely to harm stakeholder value and lead to below-average returns. In suboptimal situa-\ntions, the CEO has too much discretion regarding strategic decisions and exercises this discretion \nto the detriment of the firm and its stakeholders. The “and” is important here, because many (or \nperhaps most) CEOs act in the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders even when their \nbase of power would allow them to do otherwise.37\n12-2b Characteristics of Top Management Teams, Firm Performance, \nand Strategic Change\nThe job of top-level managers is complex and requires a broad knowledge of the firm’s internal \norganization (see Chapter 3) as well as the three key parts of its external environment—the gen-\neral, industry, and competitor environments (see Chapter 2). Therefore, firms try to form a top \nmanagement team with the knowledge and expertise needed to operate the internal organization \nand deal with the firm’s stakeholders as well as its competitors.38 Organizing a team with different \ntypes of expertise and knowledge bases typically creates a heterogeneous top management team. \nMore specifically, a heterogeneous top management team is composed of individuals with differ-\nent functional backgrounds, experience, and education. Based on a large-scale study, McKinsey & \nCo. consultants “found that companies with diverse executive teams posted bigger profit margins \nthan their rivals, compared with companies with relatively little diversity in their upper echelons.”39\nA top management team \n(TMT) is composed of the \nindividuals responsible for \nmaking certain the firm uses \nthe strategic management \nprocess, especially to select \nand implement strategies.\nA heterogeneous top \nmanagement team is \ncomposed of individuals \nwith different functional \nbackgrounds, experience, and \neducation.\nLearning Objective\n12-2 Explain what top \nmanagement teams are \nand how they affect firm \nperformance.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

TMT international diversity can also lead to better firm-wide coordination and integra-\ntion of knowledge. Research has demonstrated that international work experience is likely to bring \nthese benefits to a multinational firm.41\nMembers of a heterogeneous TMT benefit from discussing their different perspectives. In \nmany cases, these discussions, and the debates they engender, increase the quality of the team’s \ndecisions, especially when a synthesis emerges within the team after evaluating different perspec-\ntives. In effect, TMT members learn from each other and thereby develop better decisions.42 In \nturn, higher-quality decisions lead to stronger firm performance.43 \nInterestingly though, the more heterogeneous and larger the TMT, the more difficult it is for \nthe team to cohesively implement strategies.44 Communication difficulties within larger top man-\nagement teams account for some of this difficulty. Basically, the diversity of perspectives associated \nwith making better decisions can actually hinder their execution. Overall, then, a group of top \nexecutives with diverse backgrounds could inhibit effective decision-making processes associated \nwith implementation if the team lacks the ability to manage itself effectively. However, effective \nmanagement of a TMT can help to overcome these issues. For example, a designated project man-\nager can play a vital role as a communicator in helping the CEO and TMT resolve issues as a strat-\negy is implemented.45\nHaving members with substantial expertise in the firm’s core businesses is also important to \na top management team’s effectiveness.46 In a high-technology industry, for example, it may be \ncritical for top management team members to have R&D expertise, particularly when firms seek \nto grow. In the final analysis, the top management team’s effect on decisions it makes depends on \nits expertise and how it manages the team as well as the context in which the team makes decisions \n(the governance structure, incentive compensation, etc.).47\nThe characteristics of TMT members, and even the personalities of the CEO and other team \nmembers, have a relationship with innovation and strategic change.48 For example, decisions \nreached by more heterogeneous top management teams have a positive relationship with inno-\nvation and strategic change, perhaps in part because heterogeneity may influence the team, or at \nleast some of its members, to think more creatively when making decisions and taking actions.49 \nSupporting these expectations are results from a recent Boston Consulting Group study, where the \nresearchers found that “increasing the diversity of leadership teams leads to more and better inno-\nvation and improved financial performance” in firms competing in both developed and emerging \neconomies.50 In another study, TMT heterogeneity and participative decision-making was found to \nbe associated with a higher level of management innovation.51 \nGender diversity in the TMT is also important to innovation and change. Researchers found \nthat after female TMT appointments, firms became more change oriented. In particular, firms were \nless likely to engage in mergers and acquisitions, and they increased their research and develop-\nment expenditures. This reflects more of a “building” rather than “buying” approach to strategic \nchange.52 Also, research has found that the presence of women on TMTs and in other top echelon \npositions is associated with “greater engagement in social and environmental projects. Their pres-\nence also positively influences the environmental and social performance and increases the level, \nquality, and transparency of sustainability disclosure. Furthermore, the presence of women in top \nechelon positions and the implementation of sustainable activities improve both the firm financial \nperformance and value.”53\nStrategic change is also influenced by whether a CEO is selected from within or outside the \nfirm and its industry. Specifically, evidence suggests that, compared to selecting a CEO from within \nthe firm or from within the firm’s industry, hiring a CEO from outside the firm and its industry \nincreases the probability strategic change will take place.54 On the other hand, although hiring a \nnew CEO from outside the industry adds diversity to the top management team, such a change can \naffect the firm’s relationships with important stakeholders, especially customers and employees.55 \nAstute managers recognize any changes of this nature and deal with them in ways that demonstrate \nhow additional heterogeneity among the team benefits stakeholders. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Research has confirmed that dismissal of \nthe CEO is more likely when the firm is performing poorly or when \nanalysts downgrade the value of the stock. CEO dismissal is also more \ncommon when a CEO has been involved in financial or some other \ntype of misconduct. In addition, a CEO who seems to be overpaid or \nhas received negative media attention is more likely to be terminated. \n“Leadership transitions are the single most destabilizing moment \nin an organization’s life, especially when they happen as a result of \ntermination.” Leadership transition periods are also a time when rivals \ncan take advantage of the situation because they are fully functional \nand the company engaged in the transition is unlikely to react. For \nexample, rivals may use the time to launch a new sales initiative or \nincrease their merger and acquisition activity. Consequently, boards \nof directors use caution before making a decision as severe as termi-\nnating a CEO. Nonetheless, it does happen.\nIn one interesting case in 2022, the board of directors of Alaska’s \nlargest electric utility, Chugach Electric Association, fired a newly \nappointed CEO less than a month after appointing him. Hal Halpern, \nthe new CEO, believes he was fired due to his age of 62, and his lawyer \nintends to sue the company based on age discrimination. However, \nthe company denies this charge and calls it a “for cause” termination. \nThis sort of termination would be for things like a failure to perform \nexecutive duties, failure to comply with directives from the board of \ndirectors, or “criminal, unethical or inappropriate behavior.” Halpern’s \nlawyer said, “They claimed that he embellished certain information in \nhis background. It’s not true at all.”\nIn another case in 2022, Anthony Slonim, CEO of Renown Health, \nwas also fired for cause. “Allegations range from sexual harassment, \nunethical behavior by top executives, financial mismanagement and \nan organizational culture rife with dysfunction and employee mis-\ntreatment.” Employees were reported as saying that Slonim “was not \na good guy to work with.” Others spoke of his narcissism and lack of \ncommunity values. They said the termination of Slonim by the board \nwas “a strong move—because the issues at the hospital have been \nbrewing for a long time under Slonim.” \nOf course, a high-performing CEO may leave voluntarily due to \nretirement or to take a different job. In addition, there are also situ-\nations when a low-performing CEO leaves voluntarily, such as when \na founder CEO is no longer performing at a level that satisfies the \nboard and stockholders. They may feel the need to leave the CEO job \nto someone else in in these situations, in the interest of the firm and \nits stakeholders. Researchers have discovered that a founder CEO is \nmore likely to voluntarily leave the CEO position if they are only one \nof multiple cofounders or if they had prior entrepreneurial experience \nbefore founding the company in which they are serving. Alternatively, \nif the firm was private for a long time before its initial public offering, \nthey are less likely to leave voluntarily because their own personal \nidentity becomes inseparable with the firm they founded.\nSources: C.

Success in this \nprocess is dependent, in part, on the commitment of the \ncurrent CEO “to developing the next generation of com-\npany leadership” and “the CEO’s degree of need to control \nthe succession process and outcomes.”59 These character-\nistics influence the nature of the succession—for example, \nwhere the successor comes from and how they are prepared \nto lead.\n12-3a Internal and External Labor Markets\nOrganizations select leaders—including CEOs and other \nmanagers–from two types of managerial labor markets—\ninternal and external.60 An internal managerial labor market \nconsists of a firm’s opportunities for managerial positions and \nthe qualified employees within it.61 An external managerial labor market is the collection of \nmanagerial career opportunities and the qualified people who are external to the organization in \nwhich the opportunities exist.62\nEmployees commonly prefer that firms use the internal managerial labor market for selection \npurposes, particularly when choosing a CEO and top management team members. Evidence sug-\ngests that firms commonly follow these preferences—the vast majority of CEOs are selected from \nthe internal labor market.63 From the employee and lower-level manager perspectives, this policy \ngives them hope that, through diligent effort, they too can be promoted to high-level management \npositions, and possibly even become the CEO.\nWith respect to the CEO position, some believe that several benefits accrue to those using \nthe internal labor market to select a new CEO, one of which is the continuing commitment to the \nfirm’s existing vision, mission, and strategies. In addition, because of their experience with the firm \nand the industry in which it competes, inside CEOs are familiar with company products, mar-\nkets, technologies, and operating procedures. Another benefit is that choosing a new CEO from \nwithin usually results in lower turnover among existing personnel, many of whom possess valuable \nfirm-specific knowledge and skills. In summary, CEOs selected from inside the firm tend to benefit \nfrom their:\n1. clear understanding of the firm’s personnel and their capabilities\n2. appreciation of the company’s culture and its associated core values\n3. deep knowledge of the firm’s core competencies as well as abilities to develop new ones as \nappropriate\n4. “feel” for what will and will not “work” in the firm.64\nDespite the understandable and legitimate reasons to select CEOs from inside the firm, boards \nof directors sometimes prefer to choose a new CEO from the external managerial labor market. \nBroadly, conditions suggesting a potentially appropriate preference to hire from outside include:\n1. the firm’s need to enhance its ability to innovate\n2. the firm’s need to reverse its recent poor performance\n3. the fact that the industry in which the firm competes is experiencing rapid growth\n4. the need for strategic change.65\nOverall, the decision to use either the internal or the external managerial labor market to select \na firm’s new CEO is one that should be based on expectations; in other words, what does the board \nof directors want the new CEO and top management team to accomplish? We address this issue \nin Figure 12.3 by showing how the composition of the top management team and the CEO suc-\ncession source (managerial labor market) interact to affect strategy. For example, when the top \nmanagement team is homogeneous (its members have similar functional experiences and educa-\ntional backgrounds) and the new CEO comes from the internal managerial labor market, the firm’s \ncurrent strategy is unlikely to change. If the firm is performing well, absolutely and relative to peers, \ncontinuing to implement the current strategy may be precisely what the board of directors wants. \nAn internal managerial \nlabor market consists of \na firm’s opportunities for \nmanagerial positions and the \nqualified employees within it. \nAn external managerial \nlabor market is the \ncollection of managerial \ncareer opportunities and the \nqualified people who are \nexternal to the organization in \nwhich the opportunities exist.\nManagers participating in a leadership training program.\nCorepics VOF/Shutterstock.com\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This, of course, would be a board’s \npreference when the firm’s performance is declining, both in absolute terms and relative to rivals. \nWhen the new CEO is from inside the firm and a heterogeneous top management team is in place, \nthe strategy may not change, but innovation is likely to continue. An external CEO succession with \na homogeneous team creates a more ambiguous situation. Furthermore, outside CEOs who lead \nmoderate change often achieve increases in performance, but high strategic change by outsiders \nfrequently leads to performance declines.66 In summary, a firm’s board of directors should use the \ninsights reflected in Figure 12.3 to inform its decision about which of the two managerial labor \nmarkets to use to select a new CEO.\n12-3b Succession Management and Executive Training\nSuccession management is equally important in corporations, government agencies, and family- \nowned firms. Speaking to the issue of succession planning in governmental agencies, Deloitte \nconsultants note that, based on their research, governmental agencies “with well-defined succes-\nsion management practices realize significant employee engagement and retention gains, due to \ntransparency in career paths and development opportunities, as well as more preparation time for \nleadership roles.”67 \nIn family firms, CEO succession requires discussion early in a family member’s career, accord-\ning to J. W. Marriott, chair of the Marriott International board of directors. Working with others, \nMarriott chose a strategic leader from the external managerial labor market (rather than selecting \na family member from the internal managerial labor market) to succeed him as CEO of Marriott \nInternational. Marriott indicated that the choice of the firm’s new CEO was in the company’s best \ninterests—the criterion that must, he believes, drive the successor decision.68 \nMany companies use leadership-screening systems to identify individuals with strategic lead-\nership potential as well as to determine the criteria individuals should satisfy to be a candidate for \nthe CEO position. The most effective of these screening systems assesses people within the firm \nand produces valuable information about the capabilities of other companies’ strategic leaders.69 \nBased on the results of these assessments, firms may place certain individuals into training and \ndevelopment programs as a means of shaping their potential as strategic leaders. Several firms have \nhigh-quality leadership programs in place, including Procter & Gamble (P&G), IBM, and Dow \nChemical. Despite the value high-quality leadership training programs can create, many compa-\nnies do not have training and succession plans in place for their top-level managers or for others \nholding key leadership positions (e.g., department heads, sections heads).70 \nIn companies throughout the world, an interim CEO is commonly appointed when a firm lacks \na succession plan or when an emergency occurs requiring an immediate appointment of a new \nCEO.71 In most cases, interim CEOs come from inside the firm. Their familiarity with the com-\npany’s operations supports their efforts to “maintain order” as the firm searches for a permanent \nCEO. Indeed, a primary advantage of appointing an interim CEO is that doing so can generate the \nFigure 12.3 Effects of CEO Succession and Top Management Team Composition on Strategy\nTop\nManagement\nTeam\nComposition\nStable\nstrategy\nAmbiguous:\npossible change in\ntop management\nteam and strategy\nStable strategy\nwith innovation\nStrategic\nchange\nHomogeneous\nHeterogeneous\nInternal CEO\nsuccession\nExternal CEO\nsuccession\nManagerial Labor Market:\nCEO Succession\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Many of the actions interact with each other. For example, managing the \nfirm’s resources effectively includes developing human capital and contributes to establishing \na strategic direction, fostering an effective culture, exploiting core competencies, using effec-\ntive and balanced organizational control systems, and establishing ethical practices. The most \neffective strategic leaders create viable options in making decisions regarding each of the key \nstrategic leadership actions.72\n12-4a Determining Strategic Direction\nDetermining strategic direction involves specifying the vision and the strategy to achieve the \nvision.73 The opportunities and threats strategic leaders believe their firm will encounter while \ncompeting against rivals influence the framing of the strategic direction.74 Increasingly, firms’ stra-\ntegic leaders are challenged to include societal contributions as part of the vision and strategy as a \nfoundation for receiving financial investments from investors.75 \nThe ideal long-term strategic direction has two parts: a core ideology and an envisioned future. \nThe core ideology motivates employees through the company’s heritage while the envisioned  \nfuture encourages them to stretch beyond their expectations of accomplishment.76 The envisioned  \nfuture serves as a guide to many aspects of a firm’s strategy implementation process, including moti-\nvation, leadership, employee empowerment, and organizational design. The strategic direction could \ninclude a host of actions such as entering new international markets and or developing a new orienta-\ntion regarding artificial intelligence.77 At Procter & Gamble, top executives envisioned a company that \nwould shed its slow-paced, cautious approach to innovation in favor of a leaner, entrepreneurial model \nin which the company would be willing to take more risks in the hope of higher returns.78\nSometimes strategic leaders fail to select a strategy that helps a firm achieve its strategic direc-\ntion. This outcome can happen when top management team members and the CEO are too com-\nmitted to the status quo.79 In this case, a firm’s strategic direction remains relatively stable across \ntime, even if changes in the environment would suggest that change is needed. An aversion to what \ndecision makers perceive as risky actions creates an inability to adjust strategies as appropriate to \ndeal with these changes. An aversion to risky actions tends to be common in firms that have per-\nformed well across time and firms with long-serving CEOs.80 \nLearning Objective\n12-4 Discuss the value \nof strategic leadership \nin determining the firm’s \nstrategic direction.\nDetermining strategic \ndirection involves specifying \nthe vision and the strategy to \nachieve the vision.\nFigure 12.4 Exercise of Effective Strategic Leadership\nEmphasizing\nEthical Practices\nEffectively\nManaging the Firm’s\nResource Portfolio \nSustaining\nan Effective\nOrganizational Culture\nEstablishing Balanced\nOrganizational Controls\nDetermining\nStrategic Direction\nEffective Strategic\nLeadership\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.\n\nChapter 12: Strategic Leadership\n325\nResearch also suggests that some CEOs are erratic or even ambivalent when choosing their \nfirm’s strategic direction. This is particularly the case when a firm faces a turbulent competitive \nenvironment, making it difficult to identify the best strategy.81 Of course, these erratic or ambiv-\nalent behaviors are unlikely to produce high performance and may lead to CEO turnover. Inter-\nestingly, research has found that incentive compensation in the form of stock options encourages \ntalented executives to select strategies that contribute to strong firm performance. However, the \nsame incentives used with less talented executives produce lower performance.82\nOf course, not all CEOs are risk averse.83 Indeed, there is evidence that risk takers become \nCEOs much faster than executives that are risk averse—an average of 14 years from first job to \nCEO for risk takers compared to 24 years for the risk averse.84 This would suggest that there are \nmore CEOs with a propensity to take risk than those who have an aversion to risk. Nonetheless, \neven when being guided by a risk-taking CEO, it is important for the firm not to lose sight of its \nstrengths and weaknesses when making changes required by a new strategic direction.\nFinally, being ambicultural can facilitate efforts to determine the firm’s strategic direction and \nto choose and implement strategies to reach it. This means strategic leaders are committed to iden-\ntifying the best organizational actions to take, particularly when implementing strategies, regard-\nless of their cultural origin.85 Ambicultural actions help the firm succeed in the short term as a \nfoundation for reaching its vision in the longer term.\n12-5 Effectively Managing the Firm’s Resource \nPortfolio\nEffectively managing the firm’s portfolio of resources is another critical strategic leadership action. \nIn Chapter 3, we provided examples of some of a firm’s tangible (i.e., financial, physical) and \nintangible (i.e., human, reputational) resources that influence competitiveness. Although a CEO or \neven a TMT cannot manage all the resources in a firm, they are still tasked with ensuring that the \nfirm’s resources are sufficient to sustain a competitive advantage and earn above-average returns. \nAt the strategic leadership level, it is helpful to talk of these resources as a form of capital, in that \nthey are assets owned by a company that can be utilized in the implementation of its strategies. \nThe categories of capital that are most relevant to strategic leadership are financial capital, human \ncapital, social capital, and organizational capital. \nEffective management of these four types of capital leads to the development of core compe-\ntencies. Examined in Chapters 1 and 3, core competencies are capabilities that serve as a source of \ncompetitive advantage for a firm over its rivals.86 Typically, core competencies relate to skills within \norganizational functions, such as manufacturing, finance, marketing, and research and develop-\nment.87 Strategic leaders must verify that employees understand the firm’s core competencies when \nselecting strategies and also ensure that the competencies are central to strategy implementation \nefforts. This suggests, for example, that with respect to their strategies, Apple emphasizes its design \ncompetence, while Netflix recognizes and concentrates on its competence of being able to deliver \nphysical, digital, and original content.88\nFirms develop core competencies over time as they learn from the results of the competitive \nactions and responses taken while competing against their rivals. Using what they have learned, \nfirms continuously reshape their capabilities to verify that they are, indeed, the path through which \ncore competencies are being developed and used to establish one or more competitive advantages.\nManaging Financial Capital\nFinancial capital refers to all the financial assets a firm possesses. Clearly, financial capital is \ncritical to organizational success; strategic leaders in both established and smaller entrepreneur-\nial ventures understand this reality.89 For example, research has demonstrated the importance \nof working capital management and having adequate working capital in generating high firm \nperformance.90 Ordinarily, oversight of working capital management in a firm would be the \nresponsibility of a high-level executive with a title such as vice president of finance, under the \ndirection of the CEO. However, ensuring that the firm has adequate capitalization to carry out \nits strategies and achieve its objectives is the responsibility of the CEO, the finance executive, \nand the board of directors. They should work cooperatively to determine targets for debt the \nLearning Objective\n12-5 Describe the \nimportance of strategic \nleaders in managing the \nfirm’s resources.\nFinancial capital refers to \nall the financial assets a firm \npossesses.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

If long-term financing is needed, \nthis group determines whether it will be obtained through new debt (e.g., bank loans or a bond \nissue), a stock issue, or a sale of assets.\nAlthough effective financial capital management is important, the most effective strategic lead-\ners recognize the equivalent importance of managing each remaining type of capital (e.g., human, \nsocial, organizational), as well as managing the integration of resources (e.g., using financial capital \nto provide training opportunities for the firm’s human capital). Most importantly, effective stra-\ntegic leaders manage the firm’s resource portfolio in ways that increase the likelihood of strong \nperformance. To do this, they organize available resources into capabilities, structure the firm to \nfacilitate using those capabilities, and choose strategies to leverage the capabilities to create value \nfor customers. \nDeveloping and Maintaining Human Capital\nHuman capital refers to the knowledge and skills of a firm’s entire workforce. From the perspective \nof human capital, firms should view employees as a capital resource requiring continuous invest-\nment.91 In Chapter 3, we introduced the concept of strategic human capital, which allows a firm \nto develop capabilities through matching the knowledge, skills, and abilities of their employees to \nparticular strategic objectives. Part of developing human capital also includes bringing talented \nhuman capital into the firm and then developing that capital to yield positive outcomes. \nThis reality suggests that people and the manner in which they are managed are highly sig-\nnificant sources of competitive advantage for firms, especially those competing in turbulent and \nfast-changing environments.92 As a support function on which firms rely to create value, human \nresource management practices have the capacity to facilitate selecting and especially implement-\ning the firm’s strategies.93 For example, high-performance work systems provide a foundation for \ndeveloping organizational capabilities associated with innovation.94\nEffective training and development programs increase the probability that some of the firm’s \nhuman capital will become effective strategic leaders. Increasingly, the link between effective pro-\ngrams and firm success is becoming stronger because the knowledge gained by participating in \nthese programs is integral to forming and then sustaining a firm’s competitive advantage.95 In addi-\ntion to building human capital’s knowledge and skills, these programs inculcate a common set \nof core values and present a systematic view of the organization, thus promoting its vision and \nhelping form an effective organizational culture. Also, the programs help strategic leaders improve \nskills that are critical to completing other tasks associated with effective strategic leadership, such \nas determining the firm’s strategic direction, exploiting, and maintaining the firm’s core compe-\ntencies, and developing an organizational culture that supports ethical practices. Thus, building \nhuman capital is vital to effective strategic leadership practices. \nWhen facing challenging conditions, firms may decide to lay off some of their human  \ncapital, a decision that can result in a significant loss of knowledge and skill. Research shows \nthat moderate-sized layoffs may improve firm performance primarily in the short run, but large  \nlayoffs result in stronger performance downturns in firm performance because of the loss of human \ncapital.96 Viewing employees as a resource to maximize rather than as a cost to minimize facilitates \nsuccessful implementation of a firm’s strategies, as does the strategic leader’s ability to approach  \nlayoffs in a manner that employees believe is fair and equitable, especially compared to the treat-\nment of their peers.97\nDeveloping Social Capital\nIn Chapter 3, we said that when firms have strong positive relationships with stakeholders, they \nare said to have social capital.98 Social capital involves relationships inside and outside the firm \nthat help in efforts to complete tasks that create value for stakeholders.99 The relationships them-\nselves have value because they lead to transfers of knowledge as well as to access to resources that \na firm may not hold internally.100 Social capital is a critical asset given that employees must coop-\nerate with one another and others outside the firm, such as suppliers and customers, to complete \ntheir work. In fact, research indicates that social capital has a positive effect on a firm’s operating \nperformance.101 In multinational organizations, employees often must cooperate across country \nboundaries on activities such as R&D or marketing to achieve performance objectives.102\nHuman capital refers to \nthe knowledge and skills of a \nfirm’s entire workforce.\nSocial capital involves \nrelationships inside and \noutside the firm that help in \nefforts to complete tasks that \ncreate value for stakeholders.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

When using cooperative \nstrategies, such as strategic alliances (see Chapter 9), firms may develop social capital by sharing \ncomplementary resources.103 Transparency between firms regarding the specifics of how they will \nshare resources creates trust and further encourages additional sharing of resources.104 Social capi-\ntal created this way yields many benefits. For example, firms with strong social capital can be more \nambidextrous; that is, they can develop or have access to multiple capabilities, providing them with \nthe flexibility to take advantage of opportunities and to respond to threats.105\nOrganizations’ experiences and research evidence suggest that the success of many types of \nfirms may partially depend on social capital. Large multinational firms, for example, often must \nestablish alliances so they can enter new foreign markets, while entrepreneurial firms often must \nestablish alliances to gain access to resources, venture capital, or other types of resources (e.g.,  \nspecial expertise that the entrepreneurial firm cannot afford to maintain in-house).106 \nProtecting Organizational Capital\nOrganizational capital refers to intangible resources the firm possesses that distinguish it from \nother firms and thus provide the potential to lead to a sustainable competitive advantage. Examples \ninclude the firm’s reputation, name, trademarks, brands, patents, and culture. Sustaining an effec-\ntive organizational culture is so important that it will be discussed as a separate category of a \nstrategic leader’s actions. This section will focus primarily on firm reputation, which is inseparably \nconnected to the value of its name, brands, and trademarks. \nFirms gain strong reputations if they produce products and services that are perceived as a good \nvalue because they are of the highest quality and best features (e.g., differentiation), they provide a \ngreat value to customers relative to how much they cost (e.g., cost leadership), they combine these two \napproaches (e.g., integrated cost leadership/differentiation), or they are custom tailored to a specific \ncustomer group (e.g., focus). The key is not the type of strategy they are pursuing, but that they imple-\nment it especially well. Once established, a firm’s reputation can be tarnished through a variety of \ndifferent types of violations. For example, a firm may do something that violates stakeholder expecta-\ntions, demonstrates inconsistency in its performance, demonstrates a lack of trustworthiness, or vio-\nlates the law. How a firm responds to such violations can also have a large impact on its reputation.107\nThe CEO has a lot of responsibility for increasing the value of a firm’s reputation as well as pro-\ntecting that value.108 Allocating resources to critical areas to protect the perceived quality of a brand, \noverseeing managers and ensuring that they act with integrity, ensuring that financial reporting is \ndone properly, and communicating effectively with stakeholders are all important in this role. The \nperceived integrity of the CEO also has a big influence on the reputation of the firm.109 CEOs can \nenhance and protect their reputations by being who they say they are, treating others with respect, \nbalancing transparency with discretion, and building bridges that unify stakeholders.110\nIn Chapter 2, we discussed the increasing importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) \nand sustainability (ESG). Reporting on social performance and initiatives has become important \nin determining a firm’s reputation to stakeholders. As we mentioned in Chapter 10, activist share-\nholders often insist that firms increase their social performance. The TMT, and especially the CEO, \nhave responsibility for making sure that the firm’s policies, actions, and reporting present an image \nof the company as a responsible citizen.\nBrand names are closely associated with a firm’s reputation.111 Indeed, the brand name of a com-\npany’s products is often the same as the name of the company, which means that the reputation of the \nbrand and the company are essentially the same in the minds of consumers. For example, Apple sells \nits products under the Apple brand name. According to an annual rating of the most valuable brands \nin the world, in 2022, the Apple brand was at the top, with an estimated value of $355 billion. Amazon \nand Google closely follow Apple. TikTok was deemed the fastest-growing brand. The United States and \nChina hold two thirds of the brand value in the world, while the value of India’s brand is growing.112\n12-6 Sustaining an Effective Organizational Culture\nIn Chapter 1, we defined organizational culture as the complex set of ideologies, symbols, and core \nvalues that individuals and groups share throughout the firm and that influence how the firm \nconducts business. Because organizational culture influences how the firm conducts its business \nOrganizational capital \nrefers to intangible resources \nthe firm possesses that \ndistinguish it from other \nfirms and thus provide \nthe potential to lead to a \nsustainable competitive \nadvantage.\nLearning Objective\n12-6 Explain what a \nfirm does to sustain an \neffective culture.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

They also know that the type of culture that leads to positive \noutcomes requires time and effort to build. Indeed, leaders must work diligently, consistently, and \nwith patience to build an effective organizational culture. Research supports leaders’ beliefs about \nculture’s importance and its relationship with strategy.115 Among other benefits, a strong culture \ninforms employees how leaders want them to respond to situations that may develop, gives employ-\nees confidence that the responses they initiate will be the correct ones, and assures employees that \nthey will be recognized and rewarded for acting in manners that demonstrate the firm’s values as \nembedded in its culture. Thus, there is a strong link between leaders and the actions they take and \nthe nature of a firm’s culture.116 \nBuilding and supporting an effective culture yields multiple specific benefits for an organiza-\ntion. For example, culture can increase employee loyalty, help a firm attract talented individuals, \nreflect a firm’s identity in that it demonstrates both how the company views itself and how it would \nlike to be viewed by stakeholders, and create intrinsic motivation for employee behavior. Overall, \ndeveloping and sustaining an effective organizational culture is indeed a key strategic leadership \naction.\nEspecially in large organizations, an organizational culture often encourages (or discourages) \nstrategic leaders and those with whom they work to pursue (or not pursue) entrepreneurial oppor-\ntunities. (We define and discuss entrepreneurial opportunities and an entrepreneurial mind-set \nin Chapter 13.) This is the case in both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations.117 This issue is \nimportant because entrepreneurial opportunities are a vital source of growth and innovation.118 \nTherefore, a key action for strategic leaders to take is to encourage and promote innovation by \npursuing entrepreneurial opportunities.\nInvesting in opportunities as real options is one way of encouraging innovation. Investing in real \noptions finds a firm investing in an opportunity now to provide the potential option of taking advan-\ntage of the opportunity at a point in the future.119 For example, a firm might buy a piece of land to have \nthe option to build on it at some time in the future should the company need more space and should \nthat location increase in value to the company. Firms might enter strategic alliances for similar rea-\nsons. In this instance, a firm might form an alliance to have the option of acquiring the partner later \nor of building a stronger relationship with it (e.g., developing a new joint venture).120\nChanging the Organizational Culture and Restructuring\nChanging a firm’s organizational culture is more difficult than maintaining it; however, effective stra-\ntegic leaders recognize the need for cultural change. Commonly, firms make incremental changes to \ntheir culture when implementing strategies. More significant and sometimes even radical changes to \norganizational culture support selecting strategies that differ from those the firm has implemented \nhistorically. Regardless of the reasons for change, shaping and reinforcing a new culture requires \neffective problem solving and communication practices. In addition, selecting the right people (those \nwho have the values the organization desires), engaging in effective performance appraisals (estab-\nlishing goals that support the new core values and measuring individuals’ progress toward reaching \nthem), and using appropriate reward systems (rewarding the desired behaviors that reflect the new \ncore values) also facilitate the forming and shaping of organizational culture.121\nEvidence suggests that cultural changes succeed only when the firm’s CEO, other key top \nmanagement team members, and middle-level managers actively support them.122 Some believe \nthat middle-level managers “are essential in a change process” and that employees become more \ncommitted to supporting change when middle-level managers are involved actively with those \nchanges.123 For cultural change to occur, middle-level managers in particular need to be highly dis-\nciplined to energize the culture and foster alignment with the firm’s vision and mission.124 In addi-\ntion, managers working at all organizational levels must be sensitive to the effects of other changes \nto the firm’s culture. For example, downsizings can have a negative effect on organizational culture, \nespecially if firms fail to implement them in accordance with the dominant organizational values.125 \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Ethical companies encourage and enable people at all levels to act ethically when \ntaking actions to implement strategies. In turn, ethical practices and the judgment informing their \ndevelopment and use create social capital in organizations. Social capital increases the amount \nof goodwill that is available to organization individuals and groups. Alternatively, over time, if \nunethical practices begin to emerge in an organization, some managers may begin to accept them \nas normal business practices.126 Once unethical practices become acceptable, individuals are more \nlikely to engage in them to meet their goals when other efforts to meet them are insufficient.127\nTo influence employees’ judgment and behavior properly, ethical practices must shape the firm’s \ndecision-making process and be an integral part of organizational culture. In fact, a values-based \nculture is the most effective means of ensuring that employees comply with the firm’s ethical stan-\ndards. In Chapter 1, we mentioned that a firm’s values define what should matter most to managers \nand employees when they make and implement strategic decisions—they are a practical applica-\ntion of business ethics. Developing a values-based culture requires constant nurturing and support, \nrewards systems that are based on the firm’s values, and behavior on the part of managers that is \nconsistent with the values.128 Also, strategic leaders, as well as others in the organization, are most \nlikely to integrate ethical values into their decisions when the company has an explicit code of \nethics, when extensive ethics training results in integration of the codes into how the firm conducts \nbusiness, and when stakeholders expect ethical behavior.129 Thus, establishing, communicating, and \nenforcing a meaningful code of ethics is an important way to encourage ethical decision making \nand actions when using the strategic management process.\nLockheed Martin is a global aerospace and security company with 114,000 employees world-\nwide.130 Consistent with the requirements of its business environment (security and government \ncontracting), the company has a strong ethical culture based on core values: “Lockheed Martin’s \nsuccess depends on our commitment to integrity. Our core values—Do What’s Right, Respect \nOthers and Perform with Excellence—are fundamental to who we are and what we do. At Lock-\nheed Martin, we believe that doing what’s right is more than just obeying laws and regulations. It’s \nholding ourselves to a higher standard, even when the law may not require us to do so.”131 The com-\npany has a code of ethics and business conduct, ethics officers in every major location around the \nworld, and holds regular ethics training sessions. These resources provide strong signals regarding \nthe expected behavior of all Lockheed Martin employees, as well as the external stakeholders with \nwhom the company does business.\n12-8 Establishing Balanced Organizational \nControls\nOrganizational controls are an important part of the strategic management process—particularly \nthe parts related to implementation (see Figure 1.1). As explained in Chapter 11, controls are nec-\nessary to help ensure that firms achieve their desired outcomes. They help strategic leaders build \ncredibility, demonstrate the value of strategies to the firm’s stakeholders, and promote and support \nstrategic change. Most critically, controls provide the parameters for implementing strategies as \nwell as letting strategic leaders know when implementation-related adjustments are required. \nIn this chapter, we focus on two organizational controls—strategic and financial—that we \nintroduced in Chapter 11. Strategic leaders are responsible for helping the firm develop and prop-\nerly use these two types of controls. As we explained in Chapter 11, financial control focuses on \nshort-term financial outcomes while strategic control focuses on the content of strategic actions \nrather than their outcomes. Some strategic actions can be correct but still result in poor financial \noutcomes because of external conditions, such as an economic recession, unexpected domestic \nor foreign government actions, or natural disasters that a firm’s leaders do not control directly. \nBecause of this, emphasizing financial controls often produces more short-term and risk-averse \ndecisions. Alternatively, strategic control encourages lower-level managers to make decisions that \nincorporate moderate and acceptable levels of risk because leaders and managers throughout the \nfirm share the responsibility for the outcomes of those decisions and actions resulting from them.\nLearning Objective\n12-7 Describe what \nstrategic leaders can do to \nestablish and emphasize \nthe need for everyone \nto demonstrate ethical \npractices in their firms.\nLearning Objective\n12-8 Discuss the \nimportance of balanced \norganizational controls.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The balanced scorecard is a tool firms use to \ndetermine if they are achieving an appropriate balance when using strategic and financial controls \nas a means of positively influencing performance.132 This tool is most appropriate when evaluating \nbusiness-level strategies; however, it is also useful when assessing other strategies that firms imple-\nment (e.g., corporate, international, and cooperative).\nThe underlying premise of the balanced scorecard is that firms jeopardize their future perfor-\nmance when they emphasize financial controls at the expense of strategic controls.133 This occurs \nbecause financial controls provide feedback about outcomes achieved from past actions but fail to \ncommunicate the drivers of future performance. Thus, an overemphasis on financial controls may \npromote behavior that sacrifices the firm’s long-term, value-creating potential for short-term per-\nformance gains. In effect, managers can make self-serving decisions when they focus on the short \nterm. Research shows that decisions balancing short-term goals with long-term goals generally \nleads to higher performance.134\nThe balanced scorecard is a product of integrating four perspectives:\n\t\n●\nfinancial (concerned with growth, profitability, and risk from the shareholders’ perspective)\n\t\n●\ncustomer (concerned with the amount of value customers perceive the firm’s products created \nfor them)\n\t\n●\ninternal business processes (concerned with the priorities for various business processes that \ncreate customer and shareholder satisfaction)\n\t\n●\nlearning and growth (concerned with the firm’s efforts to create a climate that supports change, \ninnovation, and growth)\nThus, using the balanced scorecard finds the firm seeking to understand how it responds to \nshareholders (financial perspective), how customers view it (customer perspective), what processes \nto emphasize to successfully use its competitive advantage (internal perspective), and what it can \ndo to improve its performance by innovating and growing (learning and growth perspective).135 \nThe four perspectives upon which a traditional balanced scorecard is based are merely recom-\nmendations regarding what is most important to strategic competitiveness. In Chapter 1, we intro-\nduced the stakeholder model of above-average returns. We also introduced the idea that primary \nstakeholders—suppliers, customers, employees, shareholders (financiers), and the communities \nin which a firm operates—are directly involved in value creation with the firm.136 This idea was \nreinforced by a signed statement through an association called the Business Roundtable, declaring \nthat the purpose of the corporation is to serve these same five stakeholder groups.137 Especially \nin a social environment that is demanding responsible business behavior, adopting a stakeholder \nperspective regarding organizational control makes good sense.138 Such an approach is also stra-\ntegically advantageous because it leads to behavior on the part of stakeholders that helps the firm \ncreate more value than might otherwise be created.139\nFigure 12.5 contains an example of a possible stakeholder-oriented balanced scorecard. It is \nbased on some of the indicators that are important to regarding each of the five primary stake-\nholder groups. Notice that the financial perspective found in the original balanced scorecard is \nnot omitted. Financial measures such as stock returns, sales growth, and risk are very important to \nshareholders, so they are included in the example criteria for shareholders. \nThe example criteria include two types of information—what stakeholders are getting from the \nfirm and what they are giving to the firm. For example, employee wages and benefits are associated \nwith what employees get from a firm, whereas productivity measures are an indication of what they \nare giving to the firm (i.e., their levels of motivation, skill levels, etc.). Both types of information \nare useful, and frequently, they are related. For example, if firm productivity is low or declining, \nperhaps employees feel unhappy with their compensation. On the other hand, if productivity is \nlow and wages are high (or comparable to what employees get in peer firms), then strategic leaders \nshould investigate what else might be driving the low productivity. Both types of information can \nhelp a firm figure out what can be done to create more value in the organization’s value-creating \nsystem, thus leading to strategic competitiveness and above-average returns.\nStrategic leaders play an important role in determining a proper balance between strategic and \nfinancial controls, whether they are in single-business firms or large diversified firms. A proper \nbalance between controls is important, in that “wealth creation for organizations where strategic \nThe balanced scorecard is \na tool firms use to determine \nif they are achieving an \nappropriate balance when \nusing strategic and financial \ncontrols as a means of \npositively influencing \nperformance.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Stra-\ntegic entrepreneurship is the final topic included in the “strategic actions” part of this text’s Analysis- \nStrategy-Performance model. We turn our attention to this topic in Chapter 13.\nFigure 12.5 A Stakeholder-Based Balanced Scoreboard \nStakeholder\nExample Criteria\nShareholders\n(financial)\nEmployees\nCustomers\nSuppliers\nCommunity\nLongevity of suppliers relationships\nQuality/timeliness of supplies\nExistence or absence of supplier-leg legal actions\nDays payable outstanding\n•\n•\n•\n•\nSurveys of customer satisfaction\nConsumer reports on product quality/safety\nReputation rankings\nProduct return rates\n•\n•\n•\n•\nWages/benefits compared to peer firms\nProductivity measures\nTurnover\nSurveys of employee satisfaction\n•\n•\n•\n•\nShareholder stock returns\nRisk associated with returns (beta, variance)\nPrice to earnings (P/E) ratio\nGrowth in sales\n•\n•\n•\n•\nExistence of community service programs\nPercentage of income donated\nInclusion on list of socially responsible firms\nPositive/negative social media posts\n•\n•\n•\n•\nSummary\n \n● Effective strategic leadership is a prerequisite to \nusing the strategic management process successfully. \nStrategic leadership entails the ability to anticipate \nevents, envision possibilities, maintain flexibility, and \nempower others to create strategic change.\n \n● Strategic leaders promote strategic change by manag-\ning through others, managing an entire organization \nrather than a functional subunit, and coping with \nthe rapid and intense changes associated with the \nglobal economy. Because of the global economy’s \ncomplexity, strategic leaders must learn how to influ-\nence human behavior effectively, often in uncertain \nenvironments. By word and by personal example, and \nthrough their ability to envision the future, effective \nstrategic leaders meaningfully influence the behaviors, \nthoughts, and feelings of those with whom they work.\n \n● The personality traits of CEOs have an influence on \ntheir style of leadership and, ultimately, on firm per-\nformance, value creation, and strategic change. The \namount of discretion CEOs have in making strategic \ndecisions is influenced by external, organizational, and \nmanagerial characteristics.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Generally, these managers are \nofficers of the corporation and may also serve on the \nboard of directors.\n \n● The TMT’s characteristics, a firm’s strategies, and the \nfirm’s performance are interrelated. For example, a top \nmanagement team with significant marketing and \nresearch and development (R&D) knowledge posi-\ntively contributes to the firm’s ability to use a growth \nstrategy. Overall, diversity (heterogeneity) increases \nthe effectiveness of most top management teams.\n \n● Typically, performance improves when the board of \ndirectors and the CEO are involved in shaping a firm’s \nstrategic direction. However, when the CEO has a great \ndeal of power, the board may be less involved in deci-\nsions about strategy formulation and implementation. \nBy nominating people for the board and simultane-\nously serving as CEO and chair of the board, CEOs \nhave increased power.\n \n● In managerial succession, the internal managerial \nlabor market and the external managerial labor mar-\nket are the sources for new CEOs. Because of their \neffect on firm performance, the selection of strategic \nleaders has implications for a firm’s effectiveness. In \nmost instances, firms use the internal market to select \ntheir CEO. Today, however, the number of instances in \nwhich new CEOs come from the external managerial \nlabor market is increasing. Commonly, firms select \noutsiders as their new CEO because of the belief that \nthey will initiate major changes in strategy. Firing a \nCEO is more likely when the firm is performing poorly \nor when analysts downgrade the stock. Dismissal is \nalso more common when the CEO has been involved \nin some type of misconduct.\n \n● Effective strategic leadership has five key leadership \nactions: determining the firm’s strategic direction, \neffectively managing the firm’s resource portfolio \n(including exploiting and maintaining core compe-\ntencies and managing financial, human, social, and \norganizational capital), sustaining an effective orga-\nnizational culture, emphasizing ethical practices, and \nestablishing balanced organizational controls.\n \n● The balanced scorecard is a tool that measures the \neffectiveness of the firm’s strategic and financial \ncontrols. A stakeholder-oriented balanced scorecard \nleads to behavior on the part of stakeholders that \nhelps the firm create more value than might oth-\nerwise be created. It is based on some of the indi-\ncators that are important to regarding each of the \nfive primary stakeholder groups. The criteria include \ntwo types of information—what stakeholders are \ngetting from the firm and what they are giving to \nthe firm. Both types of information can help a firm \nfigure out what can be done to create more value in \nthe organization’s value-creating system, thus lead-\ning to strategic competitiveness and above-average \nreturns.\nKey Terms\nbalanced scorecard 330\ndetermining strategic direction 324\nexternal managerial labor market 322\nfinancial capital 325\nheterogeneous top management team 319\nhuman capital 326\ninternal managerial labor market 322\norganizational capital 327\nsocial capital 326\nstrategic change 315\nstrategic leadership 315\ntop management team (TMT) 319\nReview Questions\n1.

Charismatic leadership “is a form of pro-\nfessional guidance or management built on a foundation of \nstrong communication skills, persuasiveness, and maybe even \na little bit of charm to help them get the most out of every-\none that works for them.” Charismatic leaders can get people \nto perform at high levels that some might think impossible. \nTheir own convictions about the work they are doing seems \nto be contagious.\nSome of the characteristics charismatic leaders possess \ninclude a clear vision of the future, the ability to tap into peo-\nple’s abilities and emotions, openness to taking risks when \nwarranted, sensitivity to the environment and people around \nthem, the ability to stay calm under pressure, confidence, \nand strong engagement skills (e.g., the ability to connect with \nothers). “Charismatic leaders, given their ability to connect \nwith people on a deep level, are especially valuable within \norganizations that are facing a crisis or are struggling to move \nforward.” Winston Churchill exhibited a high level of charis-\nmatic leadership in helping Great Britain survive World War II.  \nMartin Luther King Jr. influenced a whole generation of \nAmericans. In business, Oprah Winfrey has a charismatic \nleadership style that “draws people to her and keeps them \ncaptivated.” Lee Iacocca’s charismatic leadership helped him \nturn around Chrysler Corporation in the late 1970s.\nResearchers have found evidence that charismatic leader-\nship is associated with follower recruitment and development \nand, ultimately, to higher firm performance. Research also sup-\nports the idea that charismatic leaders can positively influence \ncreativity and group performance. However, researchers also \nfound that sometimes charismatic leadership can discourage \npeople from expressing and working out conflicts in the organi-\nzation. In addition, charismatic leaders are sometimes perceived \nas self-centered or phony. Perhaps even more important, those \nsurrounding a charismatic leader may feel as though the leader \nwants to be blindly followed, which can stifle their willingness \nto provide alternative perspectives on important strategic issues.\nNot surprisingly, there is debate about whether someone \ncan learn to be a charismatic leader or must be born with \nthose characteristics. In addition, charismatic leadership is \nimportant in some contexts than in others. There is also dis-\ncussion about whether charismatic leadership is the same \nthing as transformational leadership. The consensus seems \nto be that they are very similar; however, transformational \nleadership typically is discussed in contexts in which large \norganizational changes are required.\nSources: D.

On January 18th Microsoft, worth more than $2 trillion, decided it \nwasn’t big enough and bid $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, a videogame firm, in its \nbiggest deal ever.” The article went on to describe a surge in investment at five of the \nbiggest tech firms—Meta, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, and Apple—which \nit playfully called MAAMA. These five firms invested $280 billion during 2021, which \nis equivalent to 9% of U.S. business investment, up from only 4% five years earlier. \nThese investments were in everything from quantum computing to driverless cars, as \nthey search for the \n“next big thing.”\nIn Chapter 1, \nwe discussed how \nthe COVID-19 \npandemic in-\ncreased demand \nfor a lot of the \nproducts and \nservices big tech \noffers. The indus-\ntry turned their \ngood fortunes \ninto investments \nin the future. The \nmetaverse seems \nlike a good bet. \nWe introduced \nthe metaverse \nin Chapter 5 \nas the next \nbattleground \nfor videogames. \nHowever, it is much more than that. It has been described as a “3D-navigable, socially \nconnected, conscience-curving, carefree virtual world.” Imagine walking into a store \nand going down the rows of goods, picking up products and reading their labels—\nputting some of them in your cart and returning the others to the shelves. Only you \nare doing all of this from your bedroom. Within about an hour, a driverless vehicle \ndelivers your products. This is the metaverse, and the technology is already here. \nMeta’s Horizon Worlds is described as a social virtual reality experience where \npeople can “explore, play and create. Discover new places with friends, solve inter-\nactive puzzles or form teams to compete in action-packed games. Design worlds of \nyour own or get to know other members of the community and be inspired by their \ncreations.” Even if Horizon Worlds fails to achieve a huge following, Meta’s engineers \nare learning, and this learning will be incorporated into a lot of Meta’s future prod-\nucts. Zuckerberg said, “Meta is testing new tools that allow creators to sell virtual \nassets and experiences within the worlds they build on Horizon.” Other virtual worlds \nthat sell everything from real estate to art include Decentraland and The SandBox. \n“Hip-hop star Snoop Dogg has purchased virtual land and a fan paid $450,000 in  \nDecember to buy a plot next door to him on The Sandbox.” Citi believes the \nmetaverse economy could be worth over $8 trillion in less than 10 years.\nRoblox is another high-tech metaverse contender. In 2004, David Baszucki founded \nthe company after working with Erik Cassel, a software engineer, to build a new \nworld. Baszucki realized that people wanted to create their own avatars and worlds, \ngo into the worlds they were creating, and chat with friends. An early prototype was \ntested at a science fair. In March 2021, Roblox went public at a value of $41 billion. \nAlthough play is a key aspect of Roblox and other virtual world venues, they also \nhave an important social dimension. “More established players have been known to \nthrow virtual get-well-soon parties for young gamers who have fallen ill.” A Lil Nas X \nrafapress/Shutterstock.com\n© anilakkus / Getty Images\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

According to Baszucki, “This is bigger than play. This gets \ninto learning, and working.” Ralph Lauren has a marketing venture on Roblox called “Winter \nEscape.” Nike has a virtual showroom called “Nikeland.” Gucci has “Gucci Garden,” where a \nbidding war led to a sales price for a virtual handbag of $4,115. The real-life handbag sells for \n$3,400. Nonetheless, like many entrepreneurial ventures in their early stages, Roblox has yet \nto make a profit.\nSpace is another huge tech investment area. Amazon plans to launch over 3,000 low-Earth-\norbit satellites through a venture called Kuiper. The satellites are intended to provide broad-\nband internet access to “unserved and underserved communities around the world.” Jeff \nBezos said about investment, “Can I stand here and tell you that our $10 billion investment \nin Kuiper will generate returns on invested capital? I can’t. I believe it will, and we’re working \nhard to ensure that’s the case. The only way to get above average returns is to take risks, and \nmany of them will not pay off.” Jeff Bezos also owns a rocket company called Blue Origin and \nwas recently launched into space in the company’s first peopled space flight. The Kuiper sat-\nellites will be in direct competition with Elon Musk’s SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies \nCorp.) satellites. Of course, SpaceX is better known as the company that provides transporta-\ntion for astronauts to the International Space Station.\nSources: M.

In essence, this concentration \nfinds firms seeking entrepreneurial opportunities in their external environment that they can \nexploit through innovations and by successfully executing their chosen strategies. Focusing on \nadvantage- and opportunity-seeking behaviors simultaneously is challenging in that by doing so, a \nfirm concentrates on selling its current products while seeking to identify needs in the marketplace \nthat it can serve by innovating. The Opening Case demonstrates this idea very well, as we see large, \nestablished big tech companies venturing into new areas while still seeking to maintain their com-\npetitiveness in their traditional business. The case also demonstrates just how risky entrepreneurial \ninvestments can be and how long they can take to pay off.\nThe focus of this chapter is on strategic entrepreneurship, which is a framework firms use to \nintegrate effectively entrepreneurial and strategic actions.1 More formally, strategic entrepreneur-\nship involves taking entrepreneurial actions using a strategic perspective. In this process, the firm \ntries to find opportunities in its external environment that it can exploit through innovations. Iden-\ntifying opportunities to exploit through innovations is the entrepreneurship dimension of strategic \nentrepreneurship; determining the best way to manage the firm’s innovation efforts competitively \nis the strategic dimension.2\n13-2 The Evolution of Nascent Markets\nStrategic entrepreneurship often takes place in nascent markets, which “are often new markets, \nbut can also be existing markets that are experiencing significant technical, regulatory, or institu-\ntional shifts that fundamentally disrupt market order.”3 Institutions that establish norms about how \nbusiness is conducted are yet to be widely acknowledged and established.4 The market structure is \nin a fluid state, with a lack of clarity about what features the ultimate product will have or how it \nwill be produced, competing technologies, and uncertain or rapidly growing demand. The electric \nvehicles market is currently a nascent market, as is the virtual reality (e.g., metaverse) market.5 \nLearning Objective \n13-1 Define strategic \nentrepreneurship \nand corporate \nentrepreneurship. \nStrategic \nentrepreneurship involves \ntaking entrepreneurial actions \nusing a strategic perspective.\nNascent markets are often \nnew markets but can also \nbe existing markets that \nare experiencing significant \ntechnical, regulatory, or \ninstitutional shifts that \nfundamentally disrupt market \norder.\nLearning Objective\n13-2 Explain nascent \nmarkets and how they \nevolve into established \nindustries. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

It ends with the first commercialization of a new product. In the \nsecond stage, firms enter the new industry, slowly at first, followed by an increase in the number \nof competitors. During this stage, we see significant breakthroughs, although the product is still \nat such a rudimentary stage that consumer demand is low. The third stage sees even more firms \nentering the industry and a significant surge in sales. Because the entering firms have diverse infor-\nmation and capabilities, there is a lot of product innovation, and consumers start to see the industry \nas legitimate.7 Over time, as product designs and manufacturing processes become more standard-\nized and customer demand takes on more of a predictable pattern, the industry stabilizes. In terms \nof the rate of change, nascent markets are similar to the fast-cycle markets discussed in Chapter 5. \nHowever, unlike fast-cycle markets, it is not always true in nascent markets that products can be \neasily and quickly imitated.\nWe consider several topics to explain strategic entrepreneurship. First, we examine entrepre-\nneurship and innovation in a strategic context. We present definitions of entrepreneurship, entre-\npreneurial opportunities, and entrepreneurs (those who engage in entrepreneurship to pursue en-\ntrepreneurial opportunities). We then describe international entrepreneurship, a process through \nwhich firms take entrepreneurial actions outside their home market. After this topic, the chapter \nshifts to descriptions of the three ways firms innovate—internally, through cooperative strategies, \nand by acquiring other companies.8 We discuss these methods separately, although most large \nfirms use all three methods to innovate. The chapter closes with summary comments about how \nfirms use strategic entrepreneurship to create value.\nBefore turning to the chapter’s topics, we should note that a major portion of the material in \nthis chapter deals with entrepreneurship and innovation that takes place in ongoing firms. More \nformally, corporate entrepreneurship is the application of entrepreneurship within an established \nfirm.9 However, much of what we discuss in this chapter is important in start-up entrepreneurial \nventures as well as established organizations.\n13-3 Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurial \nOpportunities\nEntrepreneurship is the process by which individuals, teams, or organizations identify and pur-\nsue entrepreneurial opportunities without being immediately constrained by the resources they \ncurrently control.10 Entrepreneurial opportunities are conditions in which new goods or services \ncan satisfy a need in the market. These opportunities exist because of competitive imperfections \nin markets and among the factors of production used to produce them, or because they were inde-\npendently developed by entrepreneurs.11 Entrepreneurial opportunities come in many forms, such \nas the chance to develop and sell a new product and the chance to sell an existing product in a \nnew market.12 Firms should be receptive to pursuing entrepreneurial opportunities whenever and \nwherever they may surface. For example, Campbell Soup Co. took advantage of a food trend that \nembraces “adventurous flavors” by launching a spicy chicken noodle soup.13 The soup is infused \nwith paprika, capsaicin, other spices, and vinegar. In response to an outcry against disposable \nstraws, Cuisinart, best known for kitchen appliances, developed a set of stainless-steel straws, \ncomplete with a cleaning brush and a silicone holder.14\nAs the definitions of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial opportunities suggest, the essence \nof entrepreneurship is to identify and exploit entrepreneurial opportunities—that is, opportunities \nothers do not see or for which they do not recognize the commercial potential—and manage risks \nappropriately as they arise.15 As a process, entrepreneurship results in the “creative destruction” of \nexisting products (goods or services) or methods of producing them and replaces them with new \nproducts and production methods.16 Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum may have the \npotential to replace long-established methods of financial transactions. However, in cryptocurren-\ncies, we can also see the huge amount of risk associated with entrepreneurial ventures. In May of \n2022, cryptocurrencies experienced huge declines in value and a lot of volatility. The effects were \ndisastrous for many individuals, companies, and even a whole country. “The plunging value of bit-\ncoin has hurt investors in cryptocurrency everywhere. The stakes are especially high in El Salvador, \nCorporate \nentrepreneurship \nis the application of \nentrepreneurship within an \nestablished firm.\nLearning Objective\n13-3 Define \nentrepreneurship \nand entrepreneurial \nopportunities and \nexplain their importance. \nEntrepreneurship is \nthe process by which \nindividuals, teams, or \norganizations identify and \npursue entrepreneurial \nopportunities without being \nimmediately constrained by \nthe resources they currently \ncontrol.\nEntrepreneurial \nopportunities are \nconditions in which new \ngoods or services can satisfy \na need in the market.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

However, evidence suggests \nthat entrepreneurship is the economic engine \ndriving many nations’ economies in the global \ncompetitive landscape.19 Thus, entrepreneur-\nship and the innovation it spawns are import-\nant for companies competing in the global \neconomy and for countries seeking to stimu-\nlate economic climates with the potential to \nenhance the living standard of their citizens.20\n13-4 Invention, Innovation, and Imitation\nIn his classic work, The Theory of Economic Development, Joseph Schumpeter argued that firms \nengage in three types of innovative activities.21 Invention is the act of creating or developing a \nnew product or process. Innovation is a process used to create a commercial product from an \ninvention.22 Thus, innovation follows invention in that invention brings something new into being \nwhile innovation brings something new into use. Accordingly, firms use technical criteria to deter-\nmine the success of an invention whereas they use commercial criteria to determine the success \nof an innovation.23 Finally, imitation is the adoption of a similar innovation by different firms.24 \nImitation usually leads to product standardization; commonly, imitative products have fewer fea-\ntures and a lower price for customers.25 Entrepreneurship is critical to innovative activity because \nit acts as the linchpin between invention and innovation.26 \nFor most companies, innovation is the most critical of the three types of innovative activities. \nThe reason is that while many companies can create ideas that lead to inventions, commercializing \nthose inventions sometimes proves to be difficult.27 Patents are a strategic asset, and the ability to \nproduce them regularly can be an important source of competitive advantage, especially when a \nfirm intends to commercialize an invention and when a firm competes in a knowledge-intensive \nindustry (e.g., pharmaceuticals).28 In a competitive sense, patents create entry barriers for a firm’s \npotential competitors.29 However, in general, entry barriers provide less protection from compe-\ntition for firms competing in the global economy. In the view of the chief information officer for \nUnilever, the giant consumer foods manufacturer, “basically there are no entry barriers” to prevent \nstart-ups from entering the markets in which his firm competes.30 Reasons for fewer entry barriers \nin Unilever’s case include consumers’ demands for natural ingredients in healthier products and \nthe fact that costs associated with manufacturing consumer goods have declined. Thus, the chal-\nlenge for today’s firms is to understand the degree to which their innovations create entry barriers \nfor potential and existing competitors.31 \nThe famous business consultant, educator, and writer Peter Drucker argued that “innovation is \nthe specific function of entrepreneurship, whether in an existing business, a public service institu-\ntion, or a new venture started by a lone individual.”32 Moreover, Drucker suggested that innovation \nis “the means by which the entrepreneur either creates new wealth-producing resources or endows \nexisting resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth.”33 Thus, entrepreneurship and the \ninnovation resulting from it are critically important for all firms as they engage rivals in competi-\ntive battles.\nThe realities of global competition suggest that to be market leaders, companies must innovate \nregularly. This means that innovation should be an intrinsic part of virtually all a firm’s activities. \nLearning Objective\n13-4 Define invention, \ninnovation, and \nimitation, and describe \nthe relationships among \nthem. \nInvention is the act of \ncreating or developing a new \nproduct or process. \nInnovation is a process \nused to create a commercial \nproduct from an invention. \nImitation is the adoption \nof a similar innovation by \ndifferent firms.\nThe cryptocurrency market crashed in 2022, after hitting record \nhighs in 2021. \nAndrey Gorgots/Shutterstock.com\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

On the other hand, pursuing entrepreneurial opportunities by \nworking as an entrepreneur can be highly satisfying—particularly when entrepreneurs recognize \nand follow their passions. According to Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com’s founder: “One of the huge mis-\ntakes people make is that they try to force an interest on themselves. You don’t choose your pas-\nsions; your passions choose you.”43\nEvidence suggests that successful entrepreneurs have an entrepreneurial mindset. An individ-\nual with an entrepreneurial mind-set values uncertainty in markets and continuously seeks to \nidentify opportunities in those markets to pursue through innovation.44 In contrast, those without \nan entrepreneurial mind-set tend to view opportunities to innovate as threats. Importantly, an en-\ntrepreneurial mind-set also includes recognition of the importance of competing internationally, \nas well as domestically.45\nThe notion of an entrepreneurial mind-set also applies to firms, where it becomes a part of \ntheir organizational culture (see Chapter 12). Five dimensions characterize a firm’s entrepreneurial \nmind-set: autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness.46 \nIn combination, these dimensions influence the actions a firm takes to be innovative when using \nthe strategic management process.\nAutonomy, the first of an entrepreneurial orientation’s five dimensions, allows employees to \ntake actions that are free of organizational constraints and encourages them to do so. The sec-\nond dimension, innovativeness, “reflects a firm’s tendency to engage in and support new ideas, \nnovelty, experimentation, and creative processes that may result in new products, services, or \ntechnological processes.”47 Cultures with a tendency toward innovativeness encourage employees \nto think beyond existing knowledge, technologies, and parameters to find creative ways to add \nvalue. Risk taking reflects a willingness by employees and their firm to accept measured levels of \nrisks when pursuing entrepreneurial opportunities. The fourth dimension of an entrepreneurial \norientation, proactiveness, describes a firm’s ability to be a market leader rather than a follower. \nProactive organizational cultures constantly use processes to anticipate future market needs \nand to satisfy them before competitors learn how to do so. Finally, competitive aggressiveness \nis a firm’s propensity to take actions through which it can outperform rivals consistently and \nsubstantially.48\nBecause it has the potential to lead to continuous innovations, an entrepreneurial mind-set can \nbe a source of competitive advantage for a firm. An entrepreneurial mind-set is encouraged when \nindividuals have easy access to new information.

In 2022, \nFast Company identified Stripe as the most in-\nnovative company in the world. The huge online \npayments company started Stripe Climate, led by \nNan Ransohoff, that allows customers “to fund \nambitious carbon-removal technology by con-\ntributing a percentage of their digital sales that \nflow through Stripe’s software.”51 Microsoft is in \nthe top 10 for humanizing work processes based \non what it discovered in a 30,000-person survey. \nSpaceX is, too, for designing rockets that make it \nmore affordable to launch people into space.\n13-6 International Entrepreneurship\nEntrepreneurship is a process that many firms exercise at both the domestic and international \nlevels. International entrepreneurship is a process in which firms creatively discover and exploit \nopportunities that are outside their domestic markets.52 This is true for entrepreneurial ventures, \nas suggested by the fact that an increasing number of them move into international markets early \nin their life cycles. Large, established companies commonly have significant foreign operations and \noften start new ventures in international markets as well.53\nFirms engage in international entrepreneurship to enhance their performance.54 Nonetheless, \nthose leading firms generally understand that taking entrepreneurial actions in markets outside \nthe firm’s home setting is challenging and not without risks, including risks of unstable foreign \ncurrencies, market inefficiencies, insufficient infrastructures to support businesses, and limitations \non market size.55 In addition, there is inadequate patent protection in some countries, especially in \nemerging markets.56 Thus, the decision to engage in international entrepreneurship needs to be a \nproduct of careful analysis.\nEven though entrepreneurship is a global phenomenon, its rate of use differs within individual \ncountries. For example, according to the Global Innovation Index, the five most entrepreneur-\nial countries in 2021 were, in the following order, Switzerland, Sweden, South Korea, the Neth-\nerlands, and Finland.57 Switzerland’s selection as the most innovative country is because of its \nknowledge-based economy (e.g., many top universities) and ability to convert innovative thinking \ninto projects that yield value-creating products for customers. Sweden is another country that em-\nphasizes education. Also, the country invests more than 3 percent of its GDP into research and \ndevelopment. Those compiling the rankings suggest that, in general, the most innovative countries \nengage students through creative teaching techniques, enforce progressive laws, conduct business \nthrough intellectually designed practices, and are home to individuals and companies that are will-\ning to take risks. \nA nation’s culture is one reason for differential rates of entrepreneurship among countries \nworldwide. In Chapter 8, we discussed Israel’s unique culture, which has allowed the country to \nachieve high levels of innovation and business success despite limited resources and an extremely \nturbulent environment. Country cultures like those found in Switzerland, Sweden, or Israel balance \nindividual initiative and a spirit of cooperation and group ownership, which encourages innovation \nLearning Objective\n13-6 Explain international \nentrepreneurship and its \nimportance. \nInternational \nentrepreneurship is \na process in which firms \ncreatively discover and exploit \nopportunities that are outside \ntheir domestic markets.\nStripe was named the most innovative company in the world in \n2022 by Fast Company.\nSource: Stripe, Inc\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This means that for firms to be entrepreneur-\nial, they must provide appropriate autonomy and incentives for individual initiative to surface while \nsimultaneously promoting cooperation and group ownership of an innovation as a foundation for \nsuccessfully exploiting it. Thus, international entrepreneurship often requires teams of people with \nunique skills and resources.\nThe level of investment outside of the home country made by young ventures is also an import-\nant dimension of international entrepreneurship. In fact, with increasing globalization, a larger \nnumber of new ventures have been “born global.”58 One reason for this is that new ventures that \nenter international markets increase their learning of new technological knowledge and thereby \nenhance their performance.59 They increase their knowledge through the external networks (e.g., \nsuppliers, customers) that they establish in the new foreign markets, including strategic alliances \nin which they participate.60\nThe probability of entering and successfully competing in international markets increases when \nthe firm’s strategic leaders, and especially its top-level managers, have international experience. Be-\ncause of the learning and economies of scale and scope afforded by operating in international mar-\nkets, both young and established internationally diversified firms often are stronger competitors in \ntheir domestic market as well. Additionally, as research has shown, internationally diversified firms \nare generally more innovative.61\nA firm’s ability to develop and sustain a competitive advantage may be based partly or in large \npart on its ability to innovate. This is true for firms engaging in international entrepreneurship as \nwell as those that have yet to do so. As we discuss next, firms can follow different paths to innovate \ninternally. Internal innovation is the first of three approaches firms use to innovate, with coopera-\ntive strategies and acquisitions strategies being the other two.\n13-7 Internal Innovation in Organizations\nEfforts in firms’ research and development (R&D) function are one primary source of internal \ninnovations. Through effective R&D, firms can generate patentable processes and innovative \nproducts.62 Increasingly, successful R&D results from integrating the skills available in the global \nworkforce. Thus, the ability to have a competitive advantage based on innovation is more likely \nto accrue to firms capable of integrating the talent of human capital from countries around the \nworld.63\nR&D and the new products and processes it can spawn affect a firm’s efforts to earn above- \naverage returns while competing in today’s global environment. Because of this ability, firms try to \nuse their R&D labs to create disruptive technologies and products. Although critical to long-term \ncompetitive success, the outcomes of R&D investments are uncertain and often not achieved in the \nshort term, meaning that patience is required as firms evaluate the outcomes of their R&D efforts.64\nAs noted earlier, successful R&D programs must have high-quality human capital—star sci-\nentists. Yet, not all ideas begin in the laboratory. For example, firms have learned that customers \nare often good sources for new products that will satisfy their needs.65 Firms also use external net-\nworks such as other scientists, published research, and even alliance partners (discussed later in \nthis chapter).66 They may even be able to use public knowledge, such as that on a current technolo-\ngy, that can be combined to create an improved technology or perhaps even a new technology.67 In \naddition, some of the most successful firms use trial-and-error processes, or what might be called \n“strategy-by-doing,” in which they introduce a product and then make frequent design improve-\nments to keep them attractive to customers.68\nCompanies use several methods to obtain employees’ ideas for new products and other types of \ninnovation. One technique is called innovation contests, in which a firm offers awards to employ-\nees who can provide the most innovative ideas for products or processes.69 Also, some firms allow \nemployees to allocate a certain amount of their time to innovative activities. At Google, employees \nhave “20 percent time,” which allows them to dedicate up to 20 percent of their working hours to \nprojects they believe have the greatest potential to benefit the firm through innovation.70 At Erics-\nson, employees are encouraged to participate in Idea Boxes. After employees submit an idea, they \nform a partnership with “idea-to-innovation” managers to develop it further and determine if it is \nfeasible and valuable. Ericsson ONE is an internal venture-funding group that provides start-up \ncapital to the best ideas.71\nLearning Objective\n13-7 Describe how \nfirms internally develop \ninnovations. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Incremental innovations are evolutionary and linear \nin nature.73 In general, firms introduce incremental innovations into established markets where \ncustomers understand and accept a product’s characteristics. In essence, incremental innova-\ntions exploit an existing technology to provide an improvement over a current product. \nAdding a different kind of whitening agent to a soap detergent is an example of an incremen-\ntal innovation, as are minor improvements in the functionality in televisions (e.g., slightly better \npicture quality). Companies introduce to markets a larger number of incremental than radical in-\nnovations, largely because they are cheaper, easier to produce quickly, and involve less risk. Yet, \nfirms normally cannot rely solely on incremental innovations. If they do so, they risk moving from \nbeing market leaders to market laggards.74 Also, from the firm’s perspective, incremental innova-\ntions tend to yield lower profit margins compared to those associated with the outcomes of radical \ninnovations, largely because competition among firms offering products to customers that have \nincremental innovations is primarily on the price variable.75\nIn contrast to incremental innovations, radical innovations usually provide significant tech-\nnological changes and create new knowledge.76 Radical innovations, revolutionary and nonlinear, \ntypically use new technologies to serve newly created markets. The development of the original \nsmartphone is an example of such an innovation, as are driverless cars. Radical innovations are rare \nbecause of the difficulty and risk involved in their development. The value of the technology and \nthe market opportunities associated with it are highly uncertain.77 Consequently, although radical \ninnovations have the potential to contribute more significantly to a firm’s efforts to earn above- \naverage returns, they also expose the firm to a higher level of risk.\nRadical innovations can have a large impact on people’s lives. Consider agentic technologies, \nwhich are technologies that become an active participant in the everyday lives of the consumers who \nuse them.78 Fitbit is one example of an agentic technology. It not only tracks the behavior of its users, \nbut it also sends them reminders of things they should do to increase their health. In addition, Fitbit \ngives users positive feedback to reinforce their healthy behaviors. Because they deal with the tech-\nnology/human interface, agentic technologies can shape the way people feel, think, believe, and act.79\nDeveloping new processes is a critical part of producing radical innovations. Because radi-\ncal innovation creates new knowledge and uses only some or little of a firm’s current product or \ntechnological knowledge, creativity is required—creativity is as important to efforts to innovate \nin not-for-profit organizations as it is in for-profit firms.80 Creativity is an outcome of using one’s \nimagination. In the words of Jay Walker, founder of Priceline.com, “Imagination is the fuel. You’re \nnot going to get innovation if you don’t have imagination.” Imagination finds firms thinking about \nwhat customers will want in a changing world. For example, Walker says, those seeking to innovate \nwithin a firm could try to imagine “what the customer is going to want in a world where, for in-\nstance, their cellphone is in their glasses.”81 Imagination is more critical to radical than incremental \ninnovations.\nThis discussion highlights the fact that internally developed incremental and radical innova-\ntions result from using a set of deliberate activities. Internal corporate venturing is the name used \nto capture this set of deliberate activities—activities that firms used to develop internal inventions \nand particularly internal innovations.82 As shown in Figure 13.1, autonomous and induced stra-\ntegic behaviors are the two types of internal corporate venturing. Each venturing type facilitates \ndevelopment of both incremental and radical innovations. However, a larger number of radical \ninnovations spring from autonomous strategic behavior, while a larger number of incremental in-\nnovations come from induced strategic behavior.\nIn essence, autonomous strategic behavior results in influences to change aspects of the firm’s \nstrategy and the structure in place to support its implementation. In contrast, induced strategic \nbehavior results from the influences of the strategy and structure the firm currently has in place to \nsupport efforts to innovate. We emphasize these points in the discussions below.\n13-7b Autonomous Strategic Behavior\nAutonomous strategic behavior is a bottom-up process in which a product champion pursues a new \nidea, often through a political process by means of which they develop and coordinate the actions \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In trying to develop a bigger, stronger, tougher adhesive, Dr. \nSilver actually discovered something called microspheres, which retain their stickiness while hav-\ning a “removable” characteristic. This characteristic allows attached surfaces to peel apart easily \n(think of your Post-it Notes). It took years, and the forming of a partnership with Art Fry, another \n3M scientist, for the company to see the innovation-related potential of Dr. Silver’s invention. In \ndescribing how this result came about, Dr. Silver said that he become known as Mr. Persistent \nbecause he would not stop trying to sell his product inside 3M.84 His persistence indicates that Dr. \nSilver indeed was a product champion. As this example shows, internal innovations springing from \nautonomous strategic behavior differ from the firm’s current strategy and structure, taking it into \nnew markets and perhaps new ways of creating value (see Figure 13.1). \nAs discussed in the Strategic Focus, government agencies sometimes seek innovation through \nautonomous strategic behavior. This is the case with the Public Investment Fund, which provides fi-\nnancial support to projects of strategic importance to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).85 While \nreading about the Public Investment Fund’s actions, notice that developing innovation throughout \nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the force driving the fund’s investment choices. \n13-7c Induced Strategic Behavior\nInduced strategic behavior, the second form of corporate venturing through which firms develop \ninnovations internally, is a top-down process whereby the firm’s current strategy and structure \nfoster innovations that are associated closely with that strategy and structure.86 In this form of \nventuring, the strategy in place filters through a matching structural hierarchy. It allows the firm \nand its managers to determine the type and amount of innovation desired.87 For example, the firm \ncould develop an intense innovation process to be the industry leader by introducing new prod-\nucts regularly, even if they cannibalize currently successful products. Intel is an example of a firm \nfollowing this practice with the regular introduction of new microprocessors that make its current \nmicroprocessors much less attractive. \nA firm that uses an induced approach to innovation needs to determine if it wishes to partic-\nipate in open innovation, “where external ideas and technologies are brought into the firm’s in-\nnovation process” and “un- and under-utilized ideas and technologies in the firm are allowed to \ngo outside to be incorporated into others’ innovation processes.”88 Open innovation, when man-\naged well, can help firms appropriate value from technologies that can be used for a variety of \ndifferent purposes, such as artificial intelligence.89 The majority of innovation is closed innovation, \nalthough open innovation is becoming more common. Open innovation may be necessary to ad-\ndress what are sometimes called wicked problems, which are problems that are connected to so \nConcept of corporate strategy\nStructural context\nStrategic context\nAutonomous\nstrategic\nbehavior\nInduced\nstrategic\nbehavior\nFigure 13.1 Model of Internal Corporate Venturing\nSource: Adapted from R.A.

Created to invest funds \nderived from a country’s reserves in ways that benefit that country’s \neconomy and citizens, sovereign wealth funds are not uncommon. \nFor example, Norway has a sovereign wealth fund with over $1 trillion \nin assets, China’s is only slightly below $1 trillion, and Hong Kong’s is \na little over $500 billion.\nSaudi Arabia’s vision for its PIF is “to be a global investment pow-\nerhouse and the world’s most impactful investor, enabling the cre-\nation of new sectors and opportunities that will shape the future \nglobal economy, while driving the economic transformation of Saudi \nArabia.” This economic transformation is important as Saudi Arabia \nseeks to reduce its dependence on oil income as the foundation for \nits economy. The structure of the PIF allows it to invest in companies \nwith the potential to innovate because of their talent. The fund notes \nthat, to date, it has “invested in some of the world’s most innovative \ncompanies, forming partnerships that will ensure Saudi Arabia is at \nthe forefront of emerging trends.” The degree to which autonomous \nstrategic behavior may emerge in a company as a means of develop-\ning innovations influences the PIF’s decisions as it evaluates firms in \nwhich it may invest. \nNoon is an e-commerce venture, with 50 percent of the invest-\nment coming from the PIF. In partnership with Dubai businessperson \nMohamed Alabbar and other investors, Noon’s permanent opera-\ntional base is in Riyadh. One of the most expensive tech ventures in \nthe Middle East, Noon is a competitive response to Amazon’s strate-\ngic action of acquiring Dubai-based Souq.com as a means of boldly \nentering the Middle Eastern markets. Described by Mr. Alabbar as \nan Arabic-first ecommerce platform, Noon offers a range of cloth-\ning, home goods, grocery staples, and multiple other items. The PIF’s \nmanagers believe that Noon will innovate in ways that will lead to \ncommercial success in the online retail industry. In turn, Noon’s com-\nmercial success would provide one avenue to reducing Saudi Arabia’s \ndependence on oil revenue.\nNoon uses a 3.5-million-square-foot fulfillment order center in \nDubai to distribute its products. Mr. Alabbar is committed to “creating \na different kind of infrastructure: a viable competitor to Amazon.com \nInc. and other global e-commerce giants, which are moving into the \nMiddle East to capitalize on an online shopping boom.” To make Noon \nthe only Arabic-first e-commerce platform competing in the Middle \nEast, Mr. Alabbar and his colleagues seek to identify innovations to \nuse as the foundation for outcompeting its rivals. With Amazon’s \nSouq.com as a competitor, the battle to innovate as a means of cap-\nturing market share will be intense. In 2021, it was announced that \nNoon would be drawing fund financing in the amount of $2 billion \nfrom the PIF and other investors to upgrade infrastructure. \nNoon is one of several investments by the PIF. In 2021, the PIF \nannounced that it would be investing in a venture called Cruise Saudi \n“which aims to establish and develop the cruise industry in Saudi \nArabia.” The intention is to “form a bridge between sea and land oper-\nations by developing cruise ports and terminals in several Saudi cities \nto provide an integrated experience with the wider tourism sector in \nthe country.” \nSources: A.

Thus, firms use an entrepreneurial mind-set to \nidentify opportunities and then develop innovations and strategies to exploit them in the market-\nplace.92 Often, firms provide incentives to individuals to be more entrepreneurial as a foundation \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

One technique is called innovation contests, in \nwhich a firm offers awards to employees who can provide the most innovative ideas for products \nor processes.93 \nOften it is difficult to convince managers to fund new ventures because of the inherent risks \ninvolved.94 Consequently, strong, supportive leadership is required for the type of creativity and \nimagination needed to develop radical innovations. A vision and mission are also important, with \na strong innovation theme, an organizational culture that encourages risk taking, open communi-\ncations within the firm, allocation of sufficient resources to promote innovative activities, and a \ncompensation system that rewards entrepreneurial behavior.95\nAdditionally, firms sometimes encourage work teams to specify what they believe are the \nmost appropriate incentives for the firm to use as a means of encouraging innovative behavior.96 \nCollectively, employees use gathered knowledge to develop new, innovative products to intro-\nduce to new markets and to capture new customers—and gain access to new resources while \ndoing so. \nHaving processes and structures in place through which a firm can exploit its innovations is \ncritical. In the context of internal corporate ventures, managers must allocate resources, coordinate \nactivities, communicate with many different parties in the organization, and make a series of deci-\nsions to convert the innovations resulting from either autonomous or induced strategic behaviors \ninto successful market entries.97 As we describe in Chapter 11, an organizational structure depicts \nthe sets of formal relationships that support processes managers use to exploit the firm’s innova-\ntions. Often, separate business units that start internal ventures produce the types of innovations \nthat lead to these positive outcomes.\nTo implement the incremental and radical innovations resulting from internal corporate ven-\ntures, firms integrate the functions involved in internal innovation efforts—from engineering to \nmanufacturing and distribution. Increasingly, firms use product development teams to achieve the \ndesired integration across organizational functions.98 Such integration involves coordinating and \napplying the knowledge and skills of different functional areas to maximize innovation and to cre-\nate a culture of continuous improvement.99 Teams must help make decisions about which projects \nto continue supporting and those to terminate. Emotional commitments sometimes increase the \ndifficulty of deciding to terminate an innovation-based project.100\n13-7e Cross-Functional Product Development Teams\nCross-functional product development teams facilitate efforts to integrate activities associated \nwith different organizational functions, such as design, manufacturing, and marketing.101 A num-\nber of individuals, representing a wide swath of the organization, are members of cross-functional \nnew product development teams.102 The reason for this is that, “in today’s globally interconnected, \nfast-paced business environment, nearly every important initiative—whether it’s revenue growth, \ncost reduction, or new product innovation—requires insights and actions from people working \nacross an organization.”103 As team members, research scientists, for example, bring technolog-\nical content knowledge to decisions made by product development teams. Those from market-\ning bring insights about products that appeal to millennials compared to members of the baby \nboomer generation. In addition to members from the organization, cross-functional product \ndevelopment teams may also include people from major suppliers because they have knowl-\nedge that can meaningfully inform a firm’s innovation processes.104 In addition, it is possible to \ncomplete new product development processes more quickly and to commercialize the products \nresulting from the processes more easily when cross-functional teams work collaboratively.105 \nUsing cross-functional teams, the firm batches product development stages into parallel pro-\ncesses so that it can tailor its product development efforts to its unique core competencies and to \nthe market’s needs.\nHorizontal organizational structures support cross-functional teams in their efforts to inte-\ngrate innovation-based activities across organizational functions.106 These are structures that have \nfew levels between the top and bottom of the organization.107 Therefore, instead of using vertical \nhierarchical functions or departments as the design framework, core horizontal processes, which \nare relied on to produce and manage innovations, are the foundation for building the organiza-\ntion. Some of the horizontal processes that are critical to innovation efforts are documented as \nprocedures and practices. More commonly, however, these important processes are informal and \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

Such team members are likely to use \nthe same decision criteria to evaluate issues, such as product development efforts, when mak-\ning decisions within their functional units. This can impede collaborative functioning within a \ncross-functional team.\nAdditionally, individuals working in various organizational functions differ from one another \nin areas such as their goals, formality of the structure guiding their work, and the amount of time \nneeded to complete their work. In turn, these differences influence how individuals working in an \norganization’s functional departments view innovation-related activities. For example, a design en-\ngineer may consider the characteristics that make a product functional and workable to be the most \nimportant ones. Alternatively, a person from the marketing function may judge characteristics that \nsatisfy customer needs to be most important. These different orientations can create barriers to \neffective communication across functions and may even generate intra-team conflict as different \nparts of the firm try to work together to innovate.110\nSome organizations experience a considerable amount of political activity (i.e., organizational \npolitics) when using cross-functional product development teams. Determining how to allocate \nresources to different functions is a key source of such activity. This means that inter-unit conflict \nmay result from aggressive competition for resources among those representing different organi-\nzational functions. This type of conflict between functions creates a barrier to cross-functional \nintegration efforts. Those trying to form effective cross-functional product development teams \nseek ways to mitigate the damaging effects of organizational politics. Emphasizing the critical role \neach function plays in the firm’s overall efforts to innovate is a method firms use to help individuals \nappreciate the value of inter-unit collaborations.\n13-7f Facilitating Integration and Innovation\nShared values and effective leadership are important for achieving cross-functional integration \nand implementing internal innovations.111 As part of culture, shared values are consistent with the \nfirm’s vision and mission and become the glue that promotes integration between functional units.\nStrategic leadership is also important to efforts to achieve cross-functional integration and \npromote internal innovation. Working with others, leaders must set goals and allocate resources \nneeded to achieve them. The goals include integrated development and commercialization of new \nproducts. Effective strategic leaders also ensure a high-quality communication system to facilitate \ncross-functional integration. A critical benefit of effective communication is the sharing of knowl-\nedge among team members, who in turn are then able to communicate an innovation’s existence \nand importance to others in the organization. Shared values and leadership practices shape the \ncommunication routines that make it possible to share innovation-related knowledge throughout \nthe firm.112\n13-7g Creating Value from Internal Innovation\nThe model in Figure 13.2 shows how firms try to create value through internal innovation pro-\ncesses (autonomous strategic behavior and induced strategic behavior). As shown, an entrepre-\nneurial mind-set is foundational to efforts to identify entrepreneurial opportunities the firm can \npursue to create value through innovations.113 As we have discussed, cross-functional teams are \nimportant for promoting integrated new product design ideas and gaining commitment to their \nsubsequent implementation. Effective leadership and shared values promote integration and vision \nfor innovation and commitment to it. However, competitive rivalry (see Chapter 5) affects the \ndegree of success a firm achieves through innovation. Thus, firms must carefully study compet-\nitors’ responses to their innovations to have the knowledge required to know how to adjust their \ninnovation-based efforts, and even when to abandon those efforts if market conditions indicate \nthe need to do so.114\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

First, they provide infor-\nmation on new business opportunities and the innovations the firm might develop to exploit \nthem.115 In other instances, firms use cooperative strategies to align what they believe are comple-\nmentary assets that have potential to lead to future innovations. Compared to other approaches \nto innovation, combining complementary assets through alliances has the potential to result more \nfrequently in radical innovations.116\nRapidly changing technologies, globalization, and the need to innovate in ways that satisfy  \nglobal standards influence firms’ decisions to innovate by cooperating with other companies. \nSome believe that because of these conditions firms are becoming increasingly dependent \non cooperative strategies as a path to innovation and, ultimately, to competitive success in \nthe global economy.117 Both entrepreneurial ventures and established firms use cooperative \nstrategies to innovate. An entrepreneurial venture, for example, may seek investment capital \nas well as established firms’ distribution capabilities to introduce successfully one of its in-\nnovative products to the market.118 Alternatively, more-established companies may need new \ntechnological knowledge and can gain access to it by forming a cooperative strategy with \nentrepreneurial ventures. Large pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies form al-\nliances to integrate their knowledge and resources to develop new products and bring them \nto market.119\nAn alliance formed between Inter IKEA Group, the parent company of the IKEA furniture \nbrand, and Marriott International, Inc. is an example of large firms using a cooperative strategy \nto innovate. These firms formed an alliance to develop Moxy, a new hotel brand that is innovative \nin its design and the value it creates for customers.120 In this alliance, IKEA provides novel and \ninnovative construction techniques (such as its famed flat-pack technology through which it can \nquickly deliver and assemble furniture) to keep manufacturing costs down, while Marriott provides \nvalue in the form of unique design. The innovative foundation of the brand is combining value \n(IKEA’s contribution) with style (Marriott’s contribution). The hotel serves millennials with mod-\nerate prices and an open lobby/restaurant/bar with music at one end and space where guests can \nwork on their devices at the other. \nLearning Objective\n13-8 Explain how \nfirms use cooperative \nstrategies to innovate. \nCross-functional\nproduct development\nteams\nEntrepreneurial\nmind-set  \nCreating value\nthrough innovation\nFacilitating integration\nand innovation\n• Shared values\n• Entrepreneurial \n   leadership\nFigure 13.2 Creating Value through Internal Innovation Processes\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In addition to conflict that is natural when firms try to  \ncollaborate to reach a mutual goal, alliance members also \ntake a risk that a partner might appropriate their technology \nor knowledge and use it for its own benefit.121 Carefully \nselecting partner firms mitigates this risk. The ideal part-\nnership is one in which the firms have complementary \nskills as well as compatible strategic goals.122 When this is \nthe case, firms encounter fewer challenges and risks as they \ntry to successfully manage their partnership. Companies \nalso want to constrain the number of cooperative arrange-\nments they form to innovate, in that becoming involved in \ntoo many alliances puts them at risk of losing the ability to \nmanage each one successfully.123\n13-9 Innovation through Acquisitions\nAcquisitions are the final approach firms use to innovate. Evidence suggests that this approach \nis gaining in popularity as firms seek to enhance their technological capabilities on a continuous \nbasis. The Boston Consulting Group offers the following commentary about this issue: “For an \nincreasing number of organizations the answer is to buy rather than to build. Acquisitions of \nhigh-tech targets have become an instrument of choice for buyers in all sectors looking to boost \ninnovation, streamline operations and processes, shape customer journeys, and personalize \nproducts, services, and experiences.”124 The Strategic Focus illustrates how Pfizer is enhancing \nits own innovative potential through acquisitions of firms that have state-of-the-art products \nand technologies.\nOne reason companies choose to acquire others as a means of innovating is that capital  \nmarkets value growth, and acquisitions provide a rapid means to grow.125 The truth is that some-\ntimes the bureaucracies associated with large companies make internal innovation difficult. There \nare too many levels at which a new idea needs approval—too much of what is sometimes called \n“red tape.” Consequently, a strategic rationale for an acquisition is often to gain ownership of an \nacquired company’s innovations and access to its innovative capabilities.126 Like Pfizer, several \nlarge technology-based companies have acquired firms largely for these purposes. Netflix acquired  \nMillarworld to gain access to the firm’s current stable of innovative products and to increase its \nability to construct and tell innovative stories across time.127 \nLike internal corporate venturing and strategic alliances, acquisitions are not a risk-free ap-\nproach to innovation. Beyond the very real risk that the alliance itself may not work out well (see \nChapter 7), a risk associated with innovative activity is that a firm may substitute an ability to ac-\nquire innovations for an ability to develop them internally. Reducing allocations to R&D may result \nwhen a firm concentrates on financial controls to identify, evaluate, and then manage acquisitions. \nOf course, strategic controls are the ones through which a firm identifies a strategic rationale to \nacquire another company as a means of developing innovations. Thus, the likelihood a firm will \nachieve success through its efforts to innovate increases by developing an appropriate balance be-\ntween financial and strategic controls. This is especially the case when strategic purposes drive \nthe acquisitions and when the process to integrate the acquired firm into the focal firm proceeds \nwithout difficulty.128 \nDespite the risks, choosing to acquire companies with complementary capabilities and \nknowledge can support a firm’s efforts to innovate successfully. For example, Vertellus, a firm that \nmanufactures specialty materials, acquired Polyscope Polymers, a company that holds a global \nleadership position in specialty additives for coatings. Polyscope’s complementary product port-\nfolio, in addition to its highly advanced manufacturing capabilities, allows Vertellus to expand its \nEuropean production and increase its reach into rapidly growing end markets.129\nIf sufficient financial capital is available, firms lacking success with internal innovation efforts \nare more likely to acquire companies possessing strong technological capabilities or that have \nnew, potentially valuable innovations.130 The ability to learn new capabilities that can facilitate \nLearning Objective\n13-9 Describe how firms \nuse acquisitions as a \nmeans of innovation. \nThe first Moxy Hotel is innovative in both its design and the value it \ncreates for customers.\nMarriott International, Inc.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Arena is “a clinical stage \ncompany developing innovative potential therapies for the treat-\nment of several immune-inflammatory diseases.” Its portfolio of \ndevelopment-stage therapies includes many areas focused on \ndermatology, gastroenterology, and cardiology. These therapies \nhave the potential to treat diseases such as ulcerative colitis, \nCrohn’s disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, atopic dermatitis, and \nalopecia areata. Mike Gladstone, global president and general \nmanager over Pfizer Inflammation and Immunology, said, “We are \nexcited to add the impressive experience and pipeline of Arena \nPharmaceuticals to Pfizer’s Inflammation and Immunology thera-\npeutic area, helping us further our purpose of developing break-\nthroughs to change the lives of those with immuno-inflammatory \ndiseases. In particular, we’re hopeful that we can accelerate clinical \ndevelopment of etrasimod successfully to have a positive impact \non those living with these debilitating diseases.”\nPfizer has a long record of buying companies to enhance its \ninnovation portfolio. Medivation was purchased for $14 billion \nin 2016 to increase Pfizer’s cancer drug capabilities, especially \ntreatment of prostate cancer. Hospira, a $15.2 billion deal in \n2015, added the largest manufacturer of generic injectable med-\nicines. King Pharmaceuticals, a $3.6 billion acquisition in 2010, \nwas acquired to expand Pfizer’s pain relief products, but it also \nincluded the EpiPen and a line of animal health products. In the \nmost expensive Pfizer deal to date, Warner-Lambert was acquired \nin 2000 at a cost of $90.2 billion. This acquisition greatly expanded \nPfizer’s worldwide presence and added a huge portfolio of prod-\nucts, including Listerine.\nAs a result of increased sales due to its COVID-19 vaccine and \ntreatment, Pfizer continues searching for new deals to add to its \npipeline of experimental products. Pfizer invested $25 billion in \nbusiness development from 2019 to early 2022. “With a growing \nchest of cash, Pfizer says its deal-making strategy will focus on \ndrugs in early- and late-stage development in areas the company \nis already focusing on, such as oncology, immunology and rare \ndiseases.” \nIn May 2022, Pfizer announced that it would buy all the stock \nit didn’t already own in Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Co. for \napproximately $11.6 billion (a 79 percent premium over the previ-\nous day’s closing price). This acquisition adds a new migraine drug \nto Pfizer’s portfolio, which is a “potential blockbuster that analysts \nsay could add billions of dollars in yearly sales to a big drugmaker \nfacing several costly patent expirations in the coming years.” Pfizer \nexecutives say they want to add an additional $25 billion in new \nrevenue from deals by the end of the decade to offset sales lost \ndue to expiring patents on aging products.\nSources: J.

Thus, some firms produce innovations internally or use cooperative strategies to innovate, \nwhile others use external knowledge and external sources for innovations. Not surprisingly, large \norganizations tend to use all three approaches to innovate. However, the quality of actions used to \nimplement each approach influences their success.131 \n13-10      Creating Value through  \nStrategic Entrepreneurship\nEntrepreneurial ventures and younger firms are often more effective at recognizing opportunities \nthan are larger, established companies.132 For that reason, entrepreneurial ventures often produce \nmore radical innovations than do larger, more established organizations. Entrepreneurial ventures’ \nstrategic flexibility and willingness to take risks account partially for their ability to produce radi-\ncal innovations. Yet, because they tend to be novel, radical innovations are also risky. Thus, these \ninnovations often fail, which frequently means that the new venture fails because such firms have \nlittle slack.133 \nAlternatively, larger, well-established firms often have more resources and capabilities to man-\nage recognized opportunities strategically in the marketplace, but these efforts generally result in \nLearning Objective\n13-10 Explain \nhow strategic \nentrepreneurship helps \nfirms create value. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Thus, younger, entrepreneurial ventures \ngenerally excel in the opportunity-seeking part of strategic entrepreneurship while larger, more \nestablished firms generally excel in the advantage-seeking part. \nAs we have discussed in this chapter, whether in a new entrepreneurial venture or as a part of \nan internal venture of an established firm, competitive success and superior performance relative \nto competitors accrues to firms capable of recognizing and exploiting opportunities. When able to \nexploit opportunities, firms establish a competitive advantage relative to their rivals.134 On a relative \nbasis then, newer entrepreneurial ventures should seek to enhance their strategic skills, while older, \nmore established firms should try to become more entrepreneurial.\nFirms trying to learn how to be more entrepreneurial and strategic simultaneously (that is, firms \ntrying to use strategic entrepreneurship) understand that, after recognizing opportunities, leaders \nwithin entrepreneurial ventures and established organizations must help their firms develop capabil-\nities that are valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and nonsubstitutable (see Chapter 3). When capabil-\nities satisfy these four criteria, the firm has the foundation in place through which strategic actions \nbecome the pathway to exploiting innovations in the marketplace and developing a competitive \nadvantage. \nAs we explained in Chapter 1, without a competitive advantage, firm success is only temporary.135 \nIf grounded in a recognized and viable market opportunity, an innovation may be valuable and rare \nearly in its life; but, by itself, an innovation does not result in a competitive advantage—strategic \nactions taken to introduce the new product to the market and protect its position against com-\npetitors are the source of competitive advantage. In combination, these actions (recognizing viable \nopportunities and using strategic actions to exploit them in the marketplace) constitute strategic \nentrepreneurship.\nThe essential responsibility of top-level managers focusing on emerging brands or innovation \nis to verify that their firm identifies entrepreneurial opportunities consistently. Additionally, they \nmanage the firm’s portfolio of innovation projects, selecting those for which further investment is \nappropriate while terminating unattractive projects.136 These managers understand that some inno-\nvative projects fail; they try to learn from those failures to enhance the success of future projects.137 \nFor projects that are to continue receiving support, chief innovation officers collaborate with \nothers to integrate the innovation into the firm’s strategy. In this sense, those responsible for iden-\ntifying opportunities the firm might want to pursue. as well as those responsible for selecting and \nimplementing the firm’s strategies. share responsibility for verifying that the firm is taking en-\ntrepreneurial actions using a strategic perspective. Chief innovation officers and those working \nin their unit also help the firm select the innovations to use to pursue opportunities and decide \nwhether those innovations should be developed internally through a cooperative strategy or by \ncompleting an acquisition. In the final analysis, the objective of these top-level managers is to help \nfirms recognize entrepreneurial opportunities and then develop successful incremental and radical \ninnovations and strategies to exploit them.\nIn this chapter, we focused on innovation’s link to organizational success. Throughout the book, \nwe have examined decisions and actions firms exercise when practicing strategic management. \nBoth skills (the ability to innovate and the ability to be strategic in marketplace competitions) are \nvital for organizational success. Today’s organizations must learn how to engage simultaneously \nin opportunity-seeking and advantage-seeking behaviors—strategic entrepreneurship combines \nthese behaviors. Thus, companies that can simultaneously master these two types of behaviors are \npoised to achieve marketplace success at the expense of competitors that lack this ability. \nSummary\n \n● Strategic entrepreneurship involves taking entrepre-\nneurial actions using a strategic perspective. Firms \nusing strategic entrepreneurship simultaneously \nengage in opportunity-seeking and advantage-seeking \nbehaviors. The purpose is to continuously find new \nopportunities and quickly develop and exploit inno-\nvations while simultaneously exploiting competitive \nadvantages that are creating value through the prod-\nucts and services the firm currently sells.\n \n● Nascent markets are often new markets but can also \nbe existing markets that are experiencing significant \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Nascent markets evolve \ninto established industries through three develop-\nmental stages. During the incubation period, a tech-\nnological discovery or identification of an unmet need \nleads to vibrant enterprising activity. It ends with the \nfirst commercialization of a new product. In the sec-\nond stage, firms enter the new industry, slowly at first, \nfollowed by an increase in the number of competitors. \nThe third stage sees even more firms entering the \nindustry and a significant surge in sales. \n \n● Entrepreneurship is a process used by individuals, \nteams, and organizations to identify entrepreneurial \nopportunities without being immediately constrained \nby the resources they control. Corporate entrepre-\nneurship is the application of entrepreneurship \n(including the identification of entrepreneurial oppor-\ntunities) within ongoing, established organizations. \nEntrepreneurial opportunities are conditions in which \nnew goods or services can satisfy a market need. \nEntrepreneurship positively contributes to individual \nfirms’ performance and stimulates growth in countries’ \neconomies.\n \n● Firms engage in three types of innovative activities:\n \n● invention, which is the act of creating a new good, \nprocess, or service\n \n● innovation, or the process of creating a commercial \nproduct from an invention\n \n● imitation, which is the adoption of similar innova-\ntions by different firms\nInvention brings something new into being, while \ninnovation brings something new into use.\n \n● Entrepreneurs see or envision entrepreneurial oppor-\ntunities and then take actions to develop innovations \nand exploit them. The most successful entrepreneurs \n(whether they are establishing their own venture or \nare working in an established organization) have an \nentrepreneurial mindset, which is an orientation that \nvalues the potential associated with opportunities that \nare available because of marketplace uncertainties.\n \n● International entrepreneurship, or the process of \nidentifying and exploiting entrepreneurial opportuni-\nties outside the firm’s domestic markets, is important \nto firms around the globe. Evidence suggests that \nfirms capable of engaging effectively in international \nentrepreneurship generally outperform those compet-\ning only in their domestic markets.\n \n● Firms use three basic approaches to produce innovation:\n \n● internal innovation, which involves R&D and form-\ning internal corporate ventures\n \n● cooperative strategies such as strategic alliances\n \n● acquisitions\n \n● Autonomous strategic behavior and induced strategic \nbehavior are the two forms of internal corporate ven-\nturing. Autonomous strategic behavior is a bottom-up \nprocess through which a product champion facilitates \nthe commercialization of an innovation. Induced stra-\ntegic behavior is a top-down process in which a firm’s \ncurrent strategy and structure facilitate the develop-\nment and implementation of innovations. Thus, the \nfirm’s current strategy and structure drives induced \nstrategic behavior, while autonomous strategic behav-\nior can result in a change to the firm’s current strategy \nand structure.\n \n● Firms create two types of innovations—incremental \nand radical—through internal innovation that takes \nplace in the form of autonomous strategic behavior \nor induced strategic behavior. Overall, firms produce \nmore incremental innovations, but radical innovations \nhave a higher probability of significantly increasing \nsales revenue and profits. Cross-functional integration \nis often vital to a firm’s efforts to develop and imple-\nment internal corporate venturing activities and to \ncommercialize the resulting innovation. \n \n● To gain access to the specialized knowledge required \nto innovate in the global economy, firms may form a \ncooperative relationship, such as a strategic alliance \nwith other companies.\n \n● Acquisitions are another method firms use to obtain \ninnovation. Acquisitions can lead to direct access to an \nacquired firm’s innovations, and/or firms can learn new \ncapabilities from an acquisition, thereby enriching \ntheir internal innovation abilities.\n \n● The practice of strategic entrepreneurship by all types \nof firms, large and small, new and more established, \ncreates value for all stakeholders, especially for share-\nholders and customers.

How does strategic entrepreneurship help firms cre-\nate value?\nMini-Case\nElectric Aviation Is Coming Soon to an Airport Near You!\nConcerns about global warming and sustainability are \namong the most important issues today. These concerns \nwere a driving force in Shaw Industries’ clean carpet man-\nufacturing (Chapter 2), the increasing popularity of electric \ncars and trucks (Chapters 2, 8, and 11), Patagonia’s green \nstrategy (Chapter 3), and competition in the development of \nlarge-scale batteries (Chapter 5). It seems that electric tech-\nnologies are going to continue to replace fossil fuel tech-\nnologies throughout this century. But what about aviation? \nIs there any hope that electric engines will replace those \nmassive jet engines that currently predominate commercial \nairlines?\nSome of the major airlines are betting on electric air-\ncraft. United Airlines announced that it is going to buy 100 \nsmall zero-emission electric airplanes from the start-up Heart \nAerospace in Sweden. United will use them for short trips in \nthe United States beginning in 2026. Finland’s Finnair and \nthe regional U.S. airline Mesa Airlines have also signed up to \npurchase Heart’s aircraft. Europe’s EasyJet has a partnership \nwith an American start-up called Wright Electric to develop \nan “all-electric, 186-seat commercial passenger jet with an \n800-mile range that’s targeted to enter service around 2030.” \nAn earlier 100-seat version is due to be completed by Wright \nElectric in 2026.\nHawaiian Airlines invested in a company that is devel-\noping what are going to be called electric sea gliders. “The \nbattery-powered sea gliders being developed by Regent, a \nBoston-based startup, are a hybrid of a boat and a plane. \nThey would cruise 5 to 20 feet above the waves on average, \nflying on a cushion of air that keeps them aloft, known as \nthe ‘ground effect.’” Hawaiian Airlines would use the sea \ngliders for short hops between the Hawaiian Islands, which \naccount for about a fifth of its revenue. The sea gliders will \nbe able to travel 180 miles from port to port, at a speed of \n180 miles per hour. Because the gliders won’t need airport \nrunways, Hawaiian hopes they will be able to use them to \nfly between harbors, filling a niche in island airline travel. \n“Digital flight control systems will react to gusts and keep \nthe vessel above the notoriously rough seas between the \nislands.”\nBeyond these major ventures, scores of companies are \nentering the race to develop electric airplanes. Lilium, based \nin Germany, has developed a six-person capacity electric \nvertical take-off and landing jet. An Israeli company named \nEviation has created a nine-seat electric commuter airplane \nit calls Alice. Eviation has received numerous awards for \nits innovations, including the Crystal Cabin Award (2021), \nthe International Yacht & Aviation Award (2020), a Gold \nEdison Award (2020), and a European Technology Award \n(2019). The company was also recognized in Time maga-\nzine’s Best Inventions for 2019. Fast Company gave Eviation \na World Changing Ideas Award in 2018 and also listed the \ncompany in its World’s Most Innovative Companies for the \nsame year.\nLarge organizations such as Airbus, Boeing, NASA, and \nToyota are backing the development of first-generation elec-\ntric aircraft technology. Also, an accelerator in Germany called \nSustainable Aero Lab is mentoring sustainable aviation start-\nups. Their specific mission is to bring together founders, expe-\nrienced entrepreneurs, researchers, industry professionals, and \ninvestors with the purpose of building a sustainable future \nfor aviation. On their home page, we find: “Open innovation:  \nWe welcome anyone who can add value towards reducing the \nclimate footprint of aviation.”\nIn just a few years, electric aircraft will establish a foothold \nin the aviation industry. “Swiss bank UBS estimates that a full \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The case method calls for your \ninstructor to guide the discussion and to solicit alternative \nviews as a way of encouraging your active participation when \nanalyzing a case. When alternative views are not forthcom-\ning, your instructor might take a position just to challenge \nyou and your peers to respond thoughtfully as a way of gen-\nerating still additional alternatives. Often, instructors will \nevaluate your work in terms of both the quantity and the \nquality of your contributions to in-class case discussions. \nThe in-class discussions are important in that you can derive \nsignificant benefit by having your ideas and recommenda-\ntions examined against those of your peers and by respond-\ning to thoughtful challenges by other class members and/or \nthe instructor.\nDuring case discussions, your instructor will likely \nlisten, question, and probe to extend the analysis of case \nissues. In the course of these actions, your peers and/ or \nyour instructor may challenge an individual’s views and the \nvalidity of alternative perspectives that have been expressed. \nThese challenges are offered in a constructive manner; their \nintent is to help all parties involved with analyzing a case \ndevelop their analytical and communication skills. Develop-\ning these skills is important in that they will serve you well \nwhen working for all types of organizations. Commonly, \ninstructors will encourage you and your peers to be inno-\nvative and original when developing and presenting ideas. \nOver the course of an individual discussion, you are likely \nto form a more complex view of the case as a result of listen-\ning to and thinking about the diverse inputs offered by your \npeers and instructor. Among other benefits, experience with \nmultiple case discussions will increase your knowledge of \nthe advantages and disadvantages of group decision-making \nprocesses.\nBoth your peers and instructor will value comments \nthat contribute to identifying problems as well as solutions \nto them. To offer relevant contributions, you are encour-\naged to think independently and, through discussions with \nyour peers outside of class, to refine your thinking. We also \nencourage you to avoid using “I think,” “I believe,” and “I feel” \nto discuss your inputs to a case analysis process. Instead, con-\nsider using a less emotion laden phrase, such as “My analysis \nshows….” This highlights the logical nature of the approach \nyou have taken to analyze a case. When preparing for an \nin-class case discussion, you should plan to use the case data \nto explain your assessment of the situation. Assume that your \npeers and instructor are familiar with the basic facts included \nin the case. In addition, it is good practice to prepare notes \nregarding your analysis of case facts before class discussions \nand use them when explaining your perspectives. Effective \nnotes signal to classmates and the instructor that you are pre-\npared to engage in a thorough discussion of a case. Moreover, \ncomprehensive and detailed notes eliminate the need for you \nto memorize the facts and figures needed to successfully dis-\ncuss a case.\nThe case analysis process described above will help pre-\npare you effectively to discuss a case during class meetings. \nUsing this process results in consideration of the issues \nrequired to identify a focal firm’s problems and to propose \nstrategic actions through which the firm can increase the \nprobability it will outperform its rivals. In some instances, \nyour instructor may ask you to prepare either an oral or a \nwritten analysis of a particular case. Typically, such an assign-\nment demands even more thorough study and analysis of the \ncase contents. At your instructor’s discretion, oral and written \nanalyses may be completed by individuals or by groups of \nthree or more people. The information and insights gained by \ncompleting the six steps shown in Table 1 often are of value \nwhen developing an oral or a written analysis. However, \nwhen preparing an oral or written presentation, you must \nconsider the overall framework in which your information \nand inputs will be presented. Such a framework is the focus \nof the next section. \nPreparing an Oral/Written  \nCase Presentation\nExperience shows that two types of thinking (analysis and \nsynthesis) are necessary to develop an effective oral or writ-\nten presentation (see Figure 1). In the analysis stage, you \nshould first analyze the general external environmental issues \naffecting the firm. Next, your environmental analysis should \nfocus on the particular industry (or industries, in the case \nof a diversified company) in which a firm operates. Finally, \nyou should examine companies against which the focal firm \ncompetes. By studying the three levels of the external envi-\nronment (general, industry, and competitor), you will be able \nto identify a firm’s opportunities and threats. Following the \nexternal environmental analysis is the analysis of the firm’s \ninternal organization. This analysis provides the insights \nneeded to identify the firm’s strengths and weaknesses.\nAs noted in Figure 1, you must then change the focus \nfrom analysis to synthesis. Specifically, you must synthesize \ninformation gained from your analysis of the firm’s external \nenvironment and internal organization. Synthesizing infor-\nmation allows you to generate alternatives that can resolve \nthe significant problems or challenges facing the focal firm. \nOnce you identify a best alternative, from an evaluation \nbased on predetermined criteria and goals, you must explore \nimplementation actions.\nPreparing an Effective Case Analysis\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

These sections are \ndescribed in the following discussion. Familiarity with the \ncontents of your book’s thirteen chapters is helpful because \nthe general outline for an oral or a written presentation shown \nin Table 2 is based on an understanding of the strategic man-\nagement process detailed in those chapters. We follow the \ndiscussions of the parts of Table 2 with a few comments about \nthe “process” to use to present the results of your case analysis \nin either a written or oral format. \nStrategic Profile and Case Analysis Purpose\nYou will use the strategic profile to briefly present the criti-\ncal facts from the case that have affected the focal firm’s his-\ntorical strategic direction and performance. The case facts \nshould not be restated in the profile; rather, these comments \nshould show how the critical facts lead to a particular focus \nfor your analysis. This primary focus should be emphasized \nin this section’s conclusion. In addition, this section should \nstate important assumptions about case facts on which your \nanalyses are based. \nSituation Analysis\nAs shown in Table 2, a general starting place for completing a \nsituation analysis is the general environment. \nGeneral Environmental Analysis. Your analysis of the \ngeneral environment should focus on trends in the seven seg-\nments of the general environment (see Table 3). Many of the \nsegment issues shown in Table 3 for the seven segments are \nexplained more fully in Chapter 2 of your book. The objective \nyou should have in evaluating these trends is to be able to pre-\ndict the segments that you expect to have the most significant \ninfluence on your focal firm over the next several years (say \nthree to five years) and to explain your reasoning for your \npredictions. \nI.

Porter’s five forces model is a useful \ntool for analyzing the industry (or industries) in which your \nfirm competes. We explain how to use this tool in Chapter \n2. In this part of your analysis, you want to determine the \nattractiveness of an industry (or a segment of an industry) in \nwhich your firm is competing. As attractiveness increases, \nso does the possibility your firm will be able to earn profits \nby using its chosen strategies. After evaluating the power \nof the five forces relative to your firm, you should make a \njudgment as to how attractive the industry is in which your \nfirm is competing. \nCompetitor Analysis. Firms also need to analyze each of \ntheir primary competitors. This analysis should identify com-\npetitors’ current strategies, strategic intent, strategic mission, \ncapabilities, core competencies, and a competitive response \nprofile (see Chapter 2). This information is useful to the focal \nfirm in formulating an appropriate strategy and in predicting \ncompetitors’ probable responses. Sources that can be used \nto gather information about an industry and companies \nwith whom the focal firm competes are listed in Appendix \nI. Included in this list is a wide range of publications, such as \nperiodicals, newspapers, bibliographies, directories of com-\npanies, industry ratios, forecasts, rankings/ratings, and other \nvaluable statistics.\nInternal Analysis. Assessing a firm’s strengths and weak-\nnesses through a value chain analysis facilitates moving \nfrom the external environment to the internal organization. \nAnalysis of the value chain activities and the support func-\ntions of the value chain provides opportunities to under-\nstand how external environmental trends affect the specific \nactivities of a firm. Such analysis helps highlight strengths \nand weaknesses (see Chapter 3 for an explanation and use of \nthe value chain).\nFor purposes of preparing an oral or a written presen-\ntation, it is important to note that strengths are internal \nresources and capabilities that have the potential to be core \ncompetencies. Weaknesses, on the other hand, are internal \nresources and capabilities that have the potential to place a \nfirm at a competitive disadvantage relative to its rivals. Thus, \nsome of a firm’s resources and capabilities are strengths; \nothers are weaknesses.\nWhen evaluating the internal characteristics of the \nfirm, your analysis of the functional activities emphasized \nis critical. For instance, if the strategy of the firm is primar-\nily technology driven, it is important to evaluate the firm’s \nR&D activities. If the strategy is market driven, market-\ning functional activities are of paramount importance. If a \nfirm has financial difficulties, critical financial ratios would \nrequire careful evaluation. In fact, because of the importance \nof financial health, most cases require financial analyses. \nAppendix II lists and operationally defines several common \nfinancial ratios. Included are tables describing profitability, \nliquidity, leverage, activity, and shareholders’ return ratios. \nLeadership, organizational culture, structure, and control \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Case analysts and orga-\nnizational strategists as well seek to match a firm’s strengths \nwith its opportunities. In addition, strengths are chosen to \nprevent any serious environmental threat from negatively \naffecting the firm’s performance. The key objective of con-\nducting a SWOT analysis is to determine how to position the \nfirm so it can take advantage of opportunities, while simul-\ntaneously avoiding or minimizing environmental threats. \nResults from a SWOT analysis yield valuable insights into \nthe selection of a firm’s strategies. The analysis of a case \nshould not be overemphasized relative to the synthesis of \nsystems (see Chapters 11 and 12) are other characteristics of \nfirms you should examine to fully understand the “internal” \npart of your firm. \nIdentification of Environmental \nOpportunities and Threats and Firm \nStrengths and Weaknesses (SWOT Analysis)\nThe outcome of the situation analysis is the identification \nof a firm’s strengths and weaknesses and its environmental \nthreats and opportunities.

In addition, leadership \nchanges and new controls or incentives may be necessary \nto implement strategic actions. The implementation actions \nyou recommend should be explicit and thoroughly explained. \nOccasionally, careful evaluation of implementation actions \nmay show the strategy to be less favorable than you thought \noriginally. A strategy is only as good as the firm’s ability to \nimplement it. \nProcess Issues\nYou should ensure that your presentation (either oral or \nwritten) has logical consistency throughout. For example, \nif your presentation identifies one purpose, but your analy-\nsis focuses on issues that differ from the stated purpose, the \nlogical inconsistency will be apparent. Likewise, your alter-\nnatives should flow from the configuration of strengths, \nweaknesses, opportunities, and threats you identified by \nanalyzing your firm’s external environment and internal \norganization.\nThoroughness and clarity also are critical to an effec-\ntive presentation. Thoroughness is represented by the \ncomprehensiveness of the analysis and alternative gen-\neration. Furthermore, clarity in the results of the analy-\nses, selection of the best alternative strategy, and design \nof implementation actions are important. For example, \nyour statement of the strengths and weaknesses should \nflow clearly and logically from your analysis of your firm’s \ninternal organization.\nPresentations (oral or written) that show logical con-\nsistency, thoroughness, and clarity of purpose, effective \nanalyses, and feasible recommendations (strategy and \nimplementation) are more effective and are likely to be \nmore positively received by your instructor and peers. \nFurthermore, developing the skills necessary to make such \npresentations will enhance your future job performance \nand career success. \nresults gained from your analytical efforts. There may be \na temptation to spend most of your oral or written case \nanalysis on results from the analysis. It is important, how-\never, that you make an equal effort to develop and evaluate \nalternatives and to design implementation of the chosen \nstrategy.\nStrategy Formulation—Strategic \nAlternatives, Alternative Evaluation,  \nand Alternative Choice\nDeveloping alternatives is often one of the most difficult steps \nin preparing an oral or a written presentation. Developing \nthree to four alternative strategies is common (see Chapter 4  \nfor business-level strategy alternatives and Chapter 6 for  \ncorporate-level strategy alternatives). Each alternative should \nbe feasible (i.e., it should match the firm’s strengths, capabili-\nties, and especially core competencies), and feasibility should \nbe demonstrated. In addition, you should show how each \nalternative takes advantage of the environmental opportunity \nor avoids/ buffers against environmental threats. Developing \ncarefully thought out alternatives requires synthesis of your \nanalyses’ results and creates greater credibility in oral and \nwritten case presentations.\nOnce you develop strong alternatives, you must evaluate \nthe set to choose the best one. Your choice should be defen-\nsible and provide benefits over the other alternatives. Thus, \nit is important that both alternative development and the \nevaluation of alternatives be thorough. The choice of the best \nalternative should be explained and defended. \nStrategic Alternative Implementation Action \nItems and Action Plan\nAfter selecting the most appropriate strategy (that is, the strat-\negy with the highest probability of helping your firm in its \nefforts to earn profits), implementation issues require atten-\ntion. Effective synthesis is important to ensure that you have \nconsidered and evaluated all critical implementation issues. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

With its enormous wings, spacious inte-\nrior and broad domed crown, the aircraft was truly an engi-\nneering feat. However, sales of the A380 had failed to surge \nas the airline industry saw a decline in demand for very large \naircrafts, and Airbus decided to halt the production of the \nA380 from 2021.1 In a press address, Airbus CEO Tom Enders \nhad sadly declared,\nIt’s a painful decision. We have invested a lot of effort, a lot \nof resources and a lot of sweat into this aircraft. But, obvi-\nously, we need to be realistic. With the decision of Emirates \nto reduce orders, our order backlog is not sufficient to sus-\ntain production.2\nThe A380 was developed as a strategic tactic by Airbus to \ncompete with Boeing in the very large aircraft market space. \nThe Boeing 747 (B747) was launched in 1965, and became \na huge success as it was the only very large aircraft in the \nmarket.3 The B747 enjoyed a monopoly for a few decades, \nand became Boeing’s Cash Cow, helping catapult the com-\npany as the market leader in the commercial aircraft manu-\nfacturing industry.\nThe aircraft manufacturing industry was capital inten-\nsive and saw several waves of consolidations from 1960 to \n1990. By the end of the 90s, it had mainly two large play-\ners - Airbus and Boeing, who competed head to head and \naccounted for more than 90% of the market share. Between \n1990 and 2001, Airbus managed to launch several wide body \nand narrow body models, and eventually became the market \nleader in 2007. The A380 was officially launched in 2005; \nhowever, its first flight only happened in 2007, mainly due \nto several production delays of the aircraft. After the launch \nof the A380, the market for the very large aircraft was split \nbetween Boeing and Airbus.\nThe demand for very large aircrafts had emerged from \na market trend in the aviation industry, where the hub-and-\nspoke model was predicted to become the main form of air \ntravel by the late 1990s. Airlines had traditionally used the \npoint-to-point travel mode. However, with economic growth, \nespecially in Asia, many large cities had established them-\nselves as mega airport hubs, and relied on the hub-and-spoke \nto connect flights with other cities across the globe. London’s\nHeathrow Airport and Singapore’s Changi Airport were \nexamples of such mega hubs that had motivated airlines like \nBritish Airways, Emirates and SIA to rely on the hub-and-\nspoke model to reconfigure traditional air travel. Very large \naircrafts supported the hub-and-spoke configuration by facil-\nitating more seats per plane, higher fuel efficiency and lesser \ncost per seat for airlines using the model. The hub-and-spoke \nmodel also supported airport stopovers, and airport shop-\nping by travellers, thereby creating a wine and cheese correla-\ntion of airlines and airports.\nHowever, post the financial crisis in 2008, air travel had \nstarted to revert to the point-to-point mode, as airlines real-\nised that it was more economical to maintain and fly medium \nsized airplanes given that running very large aircrafts profit-\nably required a full aircraft for every flight. After the financial \ncrisis, many new budget airlines started to emerge and became \nhuge hits. Such airlines typically used medium to small sized \naircrafts and the point-to-point mode to offer travellers a seat-\nonly air travel experience for much cheaper ticket prices.\nBy 2010, the demand for very large aircrafts had started \nto slow down, and by 2018, many connoisseur airlines of hub-\nand-spoke travel started to reassess their strategies. Both A380 \nand B747 that catered to the hub-and-spoke model saw a dra-\nmatic decline in demand over the ensuing years. The A380 had \nbeen a hugely expensive project for Airbus in terms of R&D \nand development costs, which had far exceeded the original \nestimates by the time the aircraft was launched. Additionally, \nbecause of its size, it had required significant investments from \nthe buyers (airlines) to accommodate the plane on their run-\naways. To remain attractive for its clients, the A380 had to be \nsubsidised heavily for the airlines. By 2019, Airbus had incurred \nhuge losses from the A380 (around US$ 219 million for the \nyear alone)4, and as it became clear that the aircraft could not \nbecome profitable in the near future, the company made the \nharsh decision of shutting down its pet project in June 2020.5\nThe demise of the A380 indicated the volatility of the \ncommercial aircraft industry, and its frequent changing \nneeds over time. What had caused the A380 to fail? Was it \nbad strategy? How could Airbus keep its competitiveness \nwith changing times, and capture the potential of the devel-\noping air travel market in Asia? How could Airbus continue \nto maintain its leadership position in the market?\nAircraft Industry before the A380\nThe motivation for the A380 was rooted in Airbus’s history, \nand its vision of competing with American aircraft manu-\nfacturers.

Despite the \nprogressing duopoly, growth in air travel was predicted to \ncontinue expanding and the consensus was that the commer-\ncial aircraft industry would become a US$1 trillion market \nover the next 20 years.18\nIn the competition between Boeing and Airbus, Boeing \nheld the upper hand because of the B747, which became \nthe most profitable airplane in the industry, allowing the \ncompany to reinvest those profits in other segments.19 The \nB747 was the only aircraft at the time in the very large \naircraft category, with more than 400 seats. Boeing had \ninvested US$1.5 billion in the B747 and saw a growth of \n39% in orders over the decade (total orders jumped from \n935 in 1989 to 1303 in 1999, with an average of 37 planes \nper year).20 21 The aircraft generated an operating profit of \nUS$40 million per plane (on an average selling price of \nUS$150 million per plane). Analysts had estimated that the \nB747 accounted for 70% of Boeing’s operating profit during \nthe 90s.22\nlike Boeing and McDonnell Douglas had become the lead-\ning providers of jet airliners in the world.6 European airplane \nmanufacturers, who had produced some of the world’s best \npassenger aircraft and pioneered commercial jet travel, felt \nthreatened, and were worried that they would end up as \nsub-contractors to American manufacturers. In July 1967, \nministers from France, Germany and Britain agreed to \nform a joint consortium named Airbus to compete with the \nAmerican manufacturers.\nThe consortium launched its first aircraft, Airbus A300, \na short-to-medium range twin-engine aircraft for short-\nhaul air travel, which started operating in 1972.7 The market \nresponse to A300 was poor, and the European governments \nhad to subsidise the consortium to keep it going. Despite the \npoor initial success, Airbus managed to sell 81 aircrafts by \n1979, and launched the A320 in 1981. The A320 was hugely \nsuccessful, with over 400 orders even before its first flight, \ncatapulting Airbus into a major player in the industry.8 While \nthe A300 was a wide body aircraft, the A320 was a narrow \nbody plane, and became popular in the point-to-point \nroutes.9\nStrategically, Airbus had started its journey building \nwide bodies, while Boeing had mainly focussed on build-\ning narrow bodies.10 However, by the late 70’s large airport \nhubs had started to emerge globally, motivating airliners to \nadopt the hub-and-spoke model increasingly.11 Foreseeing \nthis market trend, Boeing had launched the first very large \ncommercial aircraft, B747, in 1970, to cater to the long-haul \nmarket, taking international air travel to a new level of excite-\nment.12 The wide body B747 brought comfortable air travel \nat affordable prices to the forefront and saw humongous suc-\ncess as a passenger as well as a cargo aircraft.13 From 1970 to \n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0\nAirbus\nBoeing\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\nYear\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\nExhibit 1 Airbus and Boeing Market Share\nSource: Ivan Png, Airbus vs Boeing, Managerial Economics, Cases, National University of Singapore, https://www \n.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ipng/mecon/cases/Airbus.pdf, accessed July 2021.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

They purchased parts such as engines, wings, frames \nand flight instruments from many long-term suppliers who \nwere heavily reliant on the manufacturer for revenues. Any \nchanges in specifications, quality standards, or delivery dates \ncould significantly and adversely affect the supply chain and \nthe production timeline of the planes.23\nAirbus and Boeing also had manufacturing sites spread \nacross different locations. Boeing developed its aircrafts \non the U.S. soil, and Airbus in Europe. Boeing manufac-\ntured its commercial aircrafts in the two principal facilities \nof Everett and Renton, in Washington, U.S. The company \nrelied on other facilities for the production of sub-assem-\nblies and machine parts from nine national (U.S.) sites and \nfive international facilities. Airbus had 15 different facilities \nacross four countries in Europe, where parts and assem-\nblies were manufactured. The wings and various parts of \nthe fuselage were manufactured at separate plants and \nsent to Toulouse, France, or Northern Germany for final \nassembly.24\nAirlines\nBy 1998, the airline industry had consolidated into two dis-\ntinct market segments. The first was the hub-and-spoke \nmarket dominated by established and powerful carri-\ners, and the second, were peripheral markets serviced by \npoint-to-point carriers, exemplified by Southwest Air-\nlines.25 The airline industry was also becoming increasingly \nglobal in orientation and scope. 26 The established airlines \nheld a dominant position in their respective countries \nand were able to fend off penetration and competition by \nnew entrants.27 At the global level, none of the individual \nmega-carriers dominant in their respective regions were \nbig enough to be a global player. All these airlines concen-\ntrated their hold on their home/niche market as a primary \nstrategy, and had limited resources to expand on a global \nscale. Most carriers opted for choosing compatible partners \nto expand globally.28\nAirlines would either purchase or lease a plane, and place \norders with the manufacturer a few years in advance, as \nplanes could take anywhere between one to two years to be \nproduced and delivered. Aircraft purchase was a huge invest-\nment decision for airlines, and typically, most airlines chose to \ninvest in models that were technologically similar to the ones \nthey already owned so that cabin personnel benefited from \nfamiliarity of aspects on various aircraft types and required \nminimal additional training to operate. This enabled cross \ncrew qualification – pilots trained to fly one aircraft could \nqualify to operate another with relatively little extra training \nand allowed airlines to better match capacity and demand. \n29 Both Boeing and Airbus tried to build commonality in all \ntheir models to promote sales and decrease operating costs. \nAdditionally, airlines also looked for attributes like fuel effi-\nciency, operational costs per seat, number of seats, and range \nwhen deciding which aircrafts to purchase or lease.30\nDecision to Launch the A380\nThe idea of the very large “super-jumbo” A3XX aircraft was \npresented in 1994. Following the announcement of the A3XX \nproject, Airbus saw a swift growth in its market share and \nby 1998, clinched 52% of the market for new aircrafts and \nreceived 556 firm orders.31\nIn 2001, the aircraft design of the new A3XX was final-\nised, the model name A380 was revealed, and the production \nprocess of the aircraft was implemented. The number 380 \nwas a break from the Airbus sequence, A300 to A340, and \nhad two primary motivations. First, the number 8 resem-\nbled the double-deck interior cross section alignment of the \nmodel. Second, it was considered a lucky number in Asian \ncountries, particularly China - the most promising growth \nmarket at the time.32 For building the A380, Airbus consulted \nmore than 20 leading airlines about what it wanted to see in \nthe new double-decker, and refined its design based on feed-\nback, targeting a 15–20% reduction in operating costs over \nthe existing Boeing B747–400.33\nThe decision to launch the A380 was driven by several \nstrategic considerations. Airbus felt that the very large air-\ncraft market had potential, and the B747 was mainly success-\nful because of its monopoly. In a company publication, Jean \nRoeder, a senior executive at Airbus, had noted,\nIf Airbus Industries was to become a real global player, \nthe 747 monopoly would have to end. Airbus was making \nefforts at this time to get 30 percent of the market, and we \nthought that this just would not be possible in the long term \nif we did not get a complete set of aircraft in our program.34\nHowever, launching the A380 was a high stake decision,  \nbecause the barriers to entry into the very large aircraft  \n(super-jumbo) market was huge due to costs involved. Boeing \nestimated the development cost for a new super-jumbo \nmodel (from scratch) would be US$20 billion (note that the \nfirst B747-100s were sold at a list price of US$24 million and \nhad estimated development cost of US$3.7 billion).35 The pro-\ncess of developing a plane typically took 2 to 5 years and the \ntotal cost of development as a rule of thumb was estimated at \nUS$20 million per seat of launch for a new plane.36 Contrary \nto Boeing’s opinion, Airbus had estimated the development \ncost for its new aircraft to be slightly over US$10 billion, total-\nling US$11.9 billion after adding operating costs.37\nAirbus management strongly believed that airlines would \ncontinue to maximise existing hub- and-spoke systems and \nhigh capacity aircrafts would help accommodate the growing \nnumber of passengers and alleviate airport slot congestion. \nThey surmised that new airlines like Emirates would find the \nsuitability of the large planes for hub-and-spoke systems and \nlong haul routes more attractive.38\nFor a while, Airbus and Boeing held discussions about \nbuilding the new “super-jumbo” together. However, these \ntalks fizzled out, as Boeing changed its perspective of the \nfuture. Boeing’s interest had declined as it believed that such a \nproduct was unlikely to recover the projected US$11.9 billion \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

However, Airbus foresaw a market for \n1,200 super-jumbo passenger aircrafts by 2025, which rep-\nresented a market value of approximately US$416 billion.39 \nBoeing had a more conservative estimate of 530 very large \naircrafts by 2025.40 Boeing also believed that any new super-\njumbo would need more than 600 seats while Airbus felt that \nthe new super-jumbo would need 500 seats.41\nThere were a few other market factors, which influenced \nthe A380 launch decision.42 The first was related to the oper-\nation costs incurred by airlines for flying aircrafts. For every \nairplane maintained by an airline, there were fixed operation \ncosts. Each seat on the plane represented a portion of the \ntotal flight cost, and hence revenue per seat and total revenue \nfrom an airplane was an important consideration.43 A hub-\nand-spoke network strategy was preferred as higher revenues \ncould be achieved through this mode with higher load in \nlarger aircrafts, while maintaining the same amount of fixed \nground facilities and personnel, leading to cost savings.\nAnother factor was the availability of slots at airports \nfor airliners to load their airplanes. Due to limited avail-\nable slots, airliners could maximise their revenue capacity \nby using larger airplanes. For example, the use of the A380 \ncould enable nearly 10 million more passengers to fly to or \nfrom London Heathrow without increasing the number of \nflights. Moreover, the percentage of passengers that used at \nleast one hub on their journey was surprisingly high and the \nvolume of seats offered for hub-to-hub or hub-to-secondary \ncity markets far outstripped the secondary-to- secondary city \ngrowth rates.44\nFor travellers, instead of travelling directly to the desti-\nnation, they could depart from their origin and connect with \nanother plane at the hub before reaching their final desti-\nnation, which usually involved a longer travel time, but at a \nlower price.45 46 In a survey conducted in 2004, 33% of respon-\ndents had chosen their particular flight based on airfare. Only \n11% of respondents picked non-stop service as their prime \nmotivation to choose a given flight.47 The economics of long- \nrange non-stop services between hub cities using smaller air-\ncraft was less feasible for airlines to undertake as competitive \nlow fares were almost impossible to achieve due to expenses \nof slots and other costs incurred at hubs.48 Large airplanes \nalso provided increased comfort standards to passengers, \nsignificantly lower fuel burn per passenger, lower costs per \npassenger mile and the ability for “slot poor” airlines to carry \nlarger number of high yield passengers.49\nRise of A380\nThe early response to the A380 was promising. By 2001, the \nproject had won 50 firm orders from six airlines - Air France, \nBritish Airways, Emirates Airlines, Qantas Airways, SIA and \nVirgin Atlantic. In addition, the same six customers had \ntaken options to buy another 42 of the new jets. However, \nwith its humungous costs of building, the company needed \nto book between 250 and 300 orders before the project could \nbreak even.50\nThe initial orders of the A380 not only increased the \nvisibility of Airbus’s commitment to the high capacity air-\ncraft market, but also put the company in a position where it \nwould be costly and embarrassing to back out.\nThe manufacturing of the aircraft commenced in 2002, \nwith the production of the wing-box component, followed \nby subassembly in 2003 and final assembly in 2004. In Jan-\nuary 2005, the first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse, and \nthe first commercial flight was collaborated with SIA on 27 \nApril 2005.51 The full-length double deck aircraft had a typi-\ncal seating capacity of 550 and was certified to carry up to 853 \npassengers. It was powered with four Rolls Royce turbofans \nand provided a range (distance it could travel between take-\noff and landing) of 8,000 nautical miles (14,800 kilometres).52\nAirbus offered a suite of services for the A380, which \nwere packaged and customised to meet customer needs.53 \nMany airlines had been able to provide new solutions, con-\nsolidate frequencies and introduce new routes relying on the \nA380’s offerings. For example, British Airways had used the \nA380 to consolidate frequencies and release valuable slots \nfor new destinations. 54 Thai Airways had replaced 10 weekly \nflights between Bangkok and Paris with a daily A380 flight \nfor the same route.55 In 2008, SIA switched all three daily \nB747 frequencies to A380 on its London to Singapore route \nto capture the high levels of demand and carry more pas-\nsengers.56 Such switches and consolidations allowed airlines \nto reduce traffic in their runaways, optimise their network, \nfocus on peak travel times and create some savings in the \nprocess.57\nThe seating capacity was believed to be the biggest advan-\ntage of the A380. More passengers in one flight reduced per \npassenger cost, translating to lower fares. This helped airlines \nattract travellers who would trade a stopover to pay a little \nless. The A380’s unique size also allowed airlines to maximise \ntheir revenue potential through an optimised, segmented \ncabin design. Analysts had estimated the A380’s operating \nmargin to be between 14 to 19%.58\nA380’s interior design was flexible and allowed different \nclass configurations depending on an airline’s needs across short \nas well as long-haul flights providing solutions to maximise rev-\nenue and increase passenger traffic (refer to Exhibit 2 for images \nof A380 – exterior and interior). The A380 cabin was considered \nthe quietest and most spacious in the sky, and its service offer-\nings ranged from a comfortable row of 11 seats in the economy \nsection (each with a spacious 18-inch width), to a private three-\nroom suite for a luxurious first-class experience.59 On-board \nbars, lounges and even showers could be added because of \nits more than 500 square meters of usable floor space, which \nwas 50% more than other large wide body models. Increased \ncomfort of travel, flexible arrangement of seats to accommo-\ndate economy, business and luxury travellers, and ability to pro-\nvide better airfares because of economies of scale contributed \ntowards making the A380 one of the most popular jets amongst \nthe passengers.60\nAirports also benefited from the scale of the A380. Both \nHeathrow and Hong Kong airports had noticed that with \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

The two airports were so keen to have \nthe A380 traffic, that they reduced the landing fees for the \nplane.61 The A380 also had a dramatic effect on connecting \ntraffic. Traffic figures had shown that the introduction of the \nA380 from San Francisco to Frankfurt had increased con-\nnecting traffic volume via Frankfurt by nearly 80%. Higher \npassenger volume also provided more revenue from regional \nand domestic feeder flights and competitive unit costs due to \neconomies of scale.62\nIncreased tourism was also observed as a key benefit of  \nthe A380 in hub airports. For example, Emirates concen-\ntrated on long-haul traffic flows between Europe, Asia, \nIndia and Australia via its hub at Dubai, serving both pri-\nmary and regional airports. Dubai’s tourism benefited from \nthis system, and it was reported that more passengers were \nstopping at Dubai for tourism, conference and business \npurposes.63 Tourism in the regions and countries linked \nby Emirates had also benefited. For example, Emirates had \ninvested heavily to promote Australia and Europe to the \nMiddle East, which attracted a large number of tourists to \nAustralia. Similarly, China Southern also benefited from \nincreased tourism through its new flights between Australia \nand UK via Guangzhou using the A380. SIA also benefited \nwith increased tourism in Singapore through the long-haul \nroutes using the A380.64\nDemise of the A380\nBy 2010, Airbus had seen some initial success for its A380 \nwith 189 orders and 41 deliveries.65 The A380 had been well \nreceived by some of the key hub airlines in Asia like Emirates \nand SIA, and received positive responses from these clients in \nthe initial years. However, despite the promising sales perfor-\nmance, some market trends had started to become increas-\ningly unfavourable against larger aircrafts. While the A380 \nrose in popularity, the demand for the B747 remained bleak, \nand Boeing reduced its production capacity of the aircraft \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Allegedly, the project had \ngarnered collective subsidies of approximately US$6.5 billion, \ncausing significant loss of sales for the Boeing 747 aircraft. \nThe EU retaliated to these allegations by filing a complaint on \nthe US aid provided to Boeing, amounting to US$19 billion.68 \nOver the years, the WTO ruled that both sides had unfairly \nsubsidised their aircraft makers.69\nProduction Delays and Rising Costs\nThe A380 also experienced several production hiccups that \ndelayed deliveries significantly. Due to the size of the aircraft, \nproduction imposed many challenges (such as the assembly \ngradually (refer to Exhibit 3 for Airbus and Boeing aircraft \norders).66 Airbus had anticipated that the economies of \nChina and India would expand rapidly, and consequent pas-\nsenger growth and volume demands between hubs in Asia \nwould force airlines to consider using larger aircrafts. How-\never, increased congestion of about 60% at hub airports in \nAsia had started to show up as early as in the late 90s, espe-\ncially in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan and many airlines \nhad started to explore point-to- point routes with smaller \naircrafts.67\nAllegations\nIn addition to changing market conditions, the A380 faced \nother roadblocks over time.

Not counting supplier facilities, around \n16 Airbus sites scattered across Europe were involved in \nthe construction of the major components. The logistics of \ntransporting components from one site to another was also \ncumbersome, and huge parts were transported by land to \nassembly units.70\nProduction delays also increased due to the complex-\nity and more time required than estimated for installing \nwiring in each aircraft, testing for weight related concerns, \nand building customised cabin interiors for each airline.71 To \nadd to these problems, the plane encountered a wing fracture \nissue during ground testing requiring elaborate fixes to the \nnew wings, which extended the delay further.72\nDue to production delays, complex fixes and re-tests, \nproject costs for the A380 crept up significantly over the years, \nmaking it almost impossible for the company to recover the \nproduction costs from sales. At the official start of the project, \nthe projected development cost was US$10.7 billion with an \nadditional capital expenditure cost of US$1.2 billion putting \nthe total development and launch cost at US$ 11.9 billion.73 \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Other mod-\nifications included reinforcement of pavements, installation \nof updated signals and lights, modification of blast pads and \nbridges and acquisition of necessary support infrastructure \nfor expanding passenger and baggage handling systems.76\nBoeing’s Counter Strategy\nTo make matters worse, Airbus’s competitor, Boeing \nresponded to the market by coming up with a completely \ndifferent strategy and product compared to the A380, which \nworked in its favour.\nIn response to the A380, Boeing had initially come up \nwith the solution of a stretched version of the B747 (425 seats) \nin 2000, which would cost about US$4 billion to develop.77 \nThe company however, failed to secure any orders for the \nstretched B747 before announcing its decision to abandon \nthe programme. But with the increasing popularity of the \nA380, Boeing announced in 2005 to develop the refined \nlonger version of the B747, the B747-8 (or referred to as B747 \nAdvanced), which would use fuel-efficient engines to carry \n450 passengers. Boeing claimed that the B747-8 would be \n10% lighter per seat and save airlines around 20% in trip-cost \nor a 6% reduction in the cost per seat-mile.78\nHowever, soon Boeing’s management changed its decision \nafter observing the congestion at hub airports, and concluded \nthat airlines would demand smaller and faster jetliners that \nwould bypass hubs altogether. In 2003, Boeing started work-\ning on a new project called the B787 Dreamliner. The B787 \nwas designed for long haul flights, with lightweight structure \nbuilt from composite materials (reducing maintenance and \nreplacement costs). The plane allowed airlines to offer direct \nflights between any pair of cities without layovers. With a \ncapacity between 248 and 336 passengers and a range of up \nto 7530 nautical miles, the B787 was designed to use 20% \nless fuel compared to other similar sized airplanes, and pro-\nvided a 10% lower cost per seat-mile compared to any other \naircraft.79\nBy 2008, Boeing received orders from more than 50 air-\nlines for 895 Dreamliner’s. The overwhelming response to the \nBoeing 787 forced Airbus to rethink its strategy and quickly \nredesign its competitive mid-sized wide-bodied jet, the A350, \nto make it even wider, and re- release it as the A350XWB \n“extra wide body”.80 Analysts believed that Boeing’s Dream-\nliner with a state-of-the-art and more recent engine technol-\nogy was likely to be far more fuel efficient than the Airbus \nA380. Boeing’s new model also provided a longer range for \nlower capacity, and therefore was more cost efficient. 81 The \nB787 was designed to bridge the gap between Boeing’s 767 \nand 747, and was priced at US$442.2 million, which was \ncheaper than the A380 - priced at US$445.6 million.82\nBoeing’s counter prediction against Airbus’s hub-and-\nspoke forecast also fared well. Boeing’s projection was that \npassenger traffic would grow by 4.9 % year on year, the airlines \nindustry would need a larger number of smaller aircrafts, and \nthe single aisle airplanes would command the largest share \nof new deliveries.83 The predicted change in demand pattern \nbecame clearer as Boeing planes designed for point-to-point \nsystems started to become increasingly popular. The mid-size \nB777 (200-300 seaters) became the company’s most lucra-\ntive model, and by 2008, orders for the second-generation \nB777 model approached 1098 aircrafts (refer to Exhibit 4 for \nAirbus and Boeing models).84 85\nAnalysts attributed the dominance of point-to-point \ntravel, despite the growth of airport hubs, to the Open Skies \nagreement, under which countries agreed to open up their \nairspace to market dynamics as opposed to being controlled \nby political allocations.86 The EU nations, the U.S. and many \nother countries had signed the agreement, allowing more \nsecondary cities to be able to offer international routes \nusing point-to-point model. Under the agreement, airlines \ncould respond to market demands and not be subject to \npolitical arrangements between countries on landings and \ntake-offs.87\nFall in Demand\nThe demand for very large aircrafts in the market had \nstarted to fall by 2010.88 Airlines that initially favoured big \nhubs such as Singapore and Dubai began to offer more \ndirect flights from a significant number of middle-sized \nairports. Most importantly, the 2008 economic crisis had \nseriously cut into the growth in air traffic, and while some \ngrowth had returned a year later, the market was smaller \nthan expected, making it harder to fill a 550 seat wide-body \naircraft.\nSurprisingly, although the airline industry made US$26 \nbillion net profit in 2019, success remained unevenly distrib-\nuted, with 65% of the total profit generated in North Amer-\nica.89 In the face of its reputation for dynamic growth and \ndemand, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for less than 20% \nof the global profitability.90\nBesides, the rise of low-cost (budget) airlines had brought \nin influential new players in the airline market and weak-\nened the long-time leaders that had seen big prospects for \nthe A380. The 2010\nAirbus Global Market Forecast had predicted that almost \n26,000 new passenger and freight aircrafts worth US$3.2 \ntrillion would be required over the next 20 years to satisfy \ndemand.91 However, these were mainly in the single-aisle seg-\nment, which was the workhorse of short-haul flights, espe-\ncially for budget airlines.\nAirlines had realised that compared to large aircrafts like \nthe A380, smaller models were more feasible for meeting con-\nsumer demand and adapting to changing market conditions. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Smaller planes took small budgets and much \nshorter timeframe to upgrade. The estimated cost of upgrad-\ning a large aircraft could be over US$45 million - almost half \nof the list price of a smaller new plane like the A320. At the \nsame time, new aircrafts with progressive technologies also \nhelped airlines gain more fuel efficiency, which was a major \ncompeting criteria amongst airlines in a cut-throat compet-\nitive market.92\nDue to high development costs, large aircrafts also faced \na longer breakeven period. Airbus had estimated that the \nbreak-even for A380 could be achieved by 2015, after taking \ninto account - delayed deliveries and overshooting develop-\nment costs.93 The program’s total number of orders had only \nreached 234 by 2010.94 Although the sales picked up in 2013, \nthe A380 soon started losing its foothold.95 It did not sell \nwell in 2014 and 2015, with a grand total of 15 orders over the \ntwo-year period.96 In 2015, Airbus delivered 55 A380s and \nin 2016, 28 A380s, rapidly depleting its order backlog. Due \nto the diminishing orders and shrinking backlog, Airbus \ndecided to slash production of the A380 to 20 units in 2017 \nand then 12 annually beginning in 2018.97 Notably, both the \nB747 and A380 saw dropping demand because of the chang-\ning market. The B747 had 92 deliveries in 1970 compared \nto seven in 2019, while Airbus had only eight deliveries in \n2019, indicating a demand dip of almost 92% for very large \naircrafts.98\nLosing Buyers\nThe connoisseurs of the A380 also started to back out on \ntheir support for the project (refer to Exhibit 5 for key cli-\nents airlines of the A380). Emirates, A380’s biggest and most \nardent client, deferred six orders from 2017 to 2018 and \nanother six orders from 2018 to 2019 due to engine problems. \nWhile Emirates had notable success with the hub-and-spoke \nmodel, like many airlines that had purchased the A380, it had \nstarted going the opposite direction by opening up new point- \nto-point routes. 99 Emirates also became more demanding \nasking for newer and customised models of A380 that could \nadapt to the market trends.100\nSIA had supported the A380 project from the start, but \nthe relationship started to turn sour when the first orders \nof the A380 got delayed by almost two years. In 2010, SIA \nexperienced faulty engine issues in three of its 11 A380 \nsuper-jumbo jets.101 In 2012, an A380 was turned back to \nSingapore after an engine problem three hours into a flight \nto Frankfurt. A380 planes were reported to be affected by a \nnumber of technical problems including minor cracks on \npart of its wings. While the A380 had been a very popular \naircraft with passengers, SIA felt that it did not quite pro-\nvide the economy and the profits that the airline had been \nexpecting.102\nThe big size of the A380 proved to be a disadvantage \nin low peak periods when it became hard to fill every seat, \nnegatively affecting the aircraft’s yield. Airlines which used \nthe A380 also faced several challenges on the ground, as \nonly a few airports could accommodate the A380 because \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Additionally, the down-\ntime (the time it took for the aircraft to manoeuvre in the \nairport and complete boarding) for the aircraft was also \nhigher, which was a deterrent in ‘slot-congested’ large air-\nports. The airlines which operated the A380 also suffered \nfrom lower fuel efficiency as lower load-factor (occupancy \nof flight) could dramatically reduce the aircraft’s fuel effi-\nciency because of its high fuel requirements.103 Besides, the \nA380 was designed for passenger transport and its freight \n(cargo) version was halted due to its size, weight issues and \nlower initial demand.\nNotably, the cargo market was a faster growing market \nthan the passenger air travel market and aircrafts like B747 \nhad minted on this opportunity due to their flexibility of \nbeing re-configured as a freight aircraft.104\nAlthough the A380 had been developed with the ambi-\ntion of luring airlines in China, the aircraft failed to attract \nthe Chinese customers. Only one airline in China, China \nSouthern, had procured five A380s from Airbus in 2011.105 \nSeveral factors had affected this muted response from \nairlines in China. Firstly, very large aircrafts had a small \ndemand in China, as the travel need was mainly domes-\ntic. Moreover, the A380 brought a risk of lower yields to \nChinese airlines, and this was a key consideration as most \nChinese airlines needed help with boosting yield and not \nvolume.106\nOther airlines also gradually lost interest in the A380 \nVirgin Atlantic had ordered six A380s in 2001 but never took \ndelivery of the planes and later cancelled its order in 2018. In \nFebruary 2019, Quantas cancelled its order of eight A380 air-\nplanes, amidst doubts of the airplane’s future. SIA had taken \ndelivery of its original batch of 19 A380s and placed a top up \norder for an additional five aircrafts taking its total commit-\nment to 24 – just one short of the number it had originally \nsigned for in 2000. However, before these new aircrafts were \ndelivered, SIA dropped a bombshell in 2016, when it decided \nnot to extend its leases on its early batch of aircrafts, reducing \nits order total from 24 to 19 airplanes.107 In February 2019, \nEmirates decided to cancel its order for 39 planes, opting \nto replace them with A350 and A330 Neos.108 Amidst such \nnegative market sentiments, Airbus decided to close the pro-\nduction of the A380 by 2021, thereby ending its super-jumbo \ndream project.\nThe Saga Continues\nDespite the A380’s much criticised journey, Airbus had con-\ntinued to remain competitive in the market with its other \nairplanes (refer to Exhibit 3 for Airbus and Boeing orders). \nMeanwhile, aviation technology had forged ahead with new \nairframes and engines, which promised lower fuel burn, less \nnoise and more efficient flying.\nNarrow-Bodies Market Trend\nNarrow body aircrafts had gained popularity due to rise in \npoint-to-point routes in the mid-size market segment, which \nwas seen to carry huge potential.109 The share of narrow bodies \nwas expected to increase from 58% in 2019 to 66% by 2029.110 \nThe demand for narrow-body aircraft was attributed to the \ngrowth of the low-cost carrier (LCC) or the budget airlines \nbusiness model (refer to Exhibit 6 for the Growth of LCC from \n2006 to 2019). Narrow bodies fitted the business model of the \nLCCs because of their extended ranges, fuel efficiency, and \n123\n24\n14\n12\n12\n10\n10\n10\n10\n6\n6\n6\n5\n3\nOrders in units\nEmiratas\nSingapore Airlines\nLufthansa\nBritish Airways\nQantas\nKorean Air\nEtihad Airways\nAir France\nQatar Airways\nMalaysia Airlines\nThai Airways International\nAsiana Airlines\nChina Southern Airlines\nAll Nippon Airways\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nSource: Author’s own, adapted from Orders and Deliveries, Airbus, Commercial Aircraft, https://www.airbus.com/aircraft \n/market/orders-deliveries.html, accessed July 2021; Orders and Deliveries, Boeing, Commercial, https://www.boeing.com \n/commercial/#/orders-deliveries, accessed July 2021.\nExhibit 5  Major Clients of The A380\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

COMAC had also started designing other planes \nin different market segments, and industry analysts felt that \nthe company could soon potentially become a competitor to \nAirbus and Boeing.120 After Boeing and Airbus struck deals \nto take over production of rival planes made by Embraer and \nBombardier, China’s COMAC was perceived as the third option \nin the market for planes with more than 100 seats.121\nAirbus Market Lead\nDespite the failure of the A380, and losses incurred from the \nproject, Airbus had fared well in the market in terms of beating \ncompetition. In 2019, it had made 863 aircraft deliveries com-\npared to 380 commercial aircrafts delivered by Boeing. Airbus \nhad also secured 768 net orders, which included 476 A321neos, \nwhich accounted for well over 70% of all orders. Meanwhile, \nBoeing’s order book had increased very modestly, with 246 gross \norders offset by 192 contractual cancellations. Boeing’s narrow \nbody aircraft (B737 MAX) had been grounded by various gov-\nernments, including China, after a report of two accidents in \n2019. This in turn had impacted many of its suppliers around the \nworld who were heavily reliant on their Boeing contracts and \nhigher maximum take- off weight.111 The goal was to accom-\nmodate more passengers with airplanes that were cheaper to \noperate than the larger, less flexible wide-body aircrafts that \ndominated long-haul flights. This transition also reflected a \ngreater willingness by passengers to accept smaller cabins on \nlong-haul flights than what was the norm just 10 years ago.112\nThe global wide-body fleet was forecast to remain at about \n20% of the market share from 2019 to 2029 with minimal growth \nprospects.113 On a separate note, worldwide passenger numbers \nwere set to surpass 4.7 billion by 2020 and increase on average \nby 200 million every year. In a 2019 report, the mature mar-\nkets of North America and Western Europe were forecasted to \nexperience relatively modest growth while Asia was expected \nto see high levels of growth, with China, India, Middle East \nand Asia Pacific growing at annual rates of 7.9%, 9.9%, 4.7%, \nand 4.2 %.114 However, almost all of the growth in these markets \nwere expected to come from budget airlines, with little over-\nall increase in premium traffic. Consequently, the new traffic \nflows were highly price sensitive, with passengers attracted to \naffordable seats provided by LCCs, which on a global basis was \nexpected to account for over a third of the market.115\nGrowing China Market\nFurther market changes and trends were fuelled by the rising \ndominance of the Chinese economy. By 2020, China had \nemerged as the world’s biggest market for aircrafts. Both \nAirbus and Boeing had sold heavily to China’s multiple state \nairlines.116 A total of 3,639 aircrafts were operating in China \nby the end of 2018 and Airbus accounted for half the market \nshare by 2019.117 China had announced a massive US$35 billion \norder for 300 Airbus planes in 2019, which was widely seen as \na blow to Boeing, which faced risks in the China market due \n0\n5%\n10%\n2006\n15.7\n17.5\n19.2\n20.3\n21.4\n22.8\n23.4\n25\n25.9\n25.4\n25.5\n30\n31\n31\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n15%\n20%\nMarket share\n25%\n30%\n35%\nExhibit 6  Growth of Budget Airlines (LCC Growth)\nSource: Low cost carriers' worldwide market share from 2007 to 2020, Aviation, Statista, https://www.statista.com \n/statistics/586677/global-low-cost-carrier-market-capacity-share/, accessed July 2021.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Amidst uncertain times, \nboth Airbus and Boeing were expecting the pandemic to take \na toll on their businesses. While both the A380 and the B747 \nwere slated to be written off soon, their experiences had surely \nleft the two competing companies with several key takeaways. \nFor Airbus, had the A380 been just a bad strategy? Alterna-\ntively, had it been a good strategy gone wrong in execution? \nWhat learning lessons had the A380 provided Airbus? How \ncould Airbus stay competitive despite the demise of its mag-\nnificent A380 in the near future? Would environmentally \nfriendly planes become the new battlefield for the two rivals - \nAirbus and Boeing?\nshared production costs with the company.122 The demand for \nthe B747 had also dwindled and it had ceased to be a Cash Cow \nfor the company. In July 2020, Boeing had decided to end the \nproduction of the B747 due to the changing market conditions.123\nEnvironmental Adaptations\nIn September 2020, Airbus had come up with three environ-\nment friendly commercial aircraft ideas that used hydrogen \nas their primary fuel source, with the ambition of making \nzero emissions a reality by 2035. This was in line with the air \ntransport industry’s long-standing goal of reducing its carbon \nfootprint by 50% below 2005 levels by 2050.124 Airbus’s CEO \nhad shared,\nWe think the laws of physics don’t need to change to \nmake hydrogen competitive on planes, it’s just a lot of \nwork on technologies, on demonstrators, on testing, on \nregulations, on certification to make it work, we believe \nit’s feasible within the time frame that we have devel-\noped.125\nIn contrast, Boeing had invested in the rollout of sus-\ntainable aviation fuels (SAF) for all its new aircrafts by 2030. \n1.

Through loyalty \nprograms, airlines rewarded repeat business with benefits \nsuch as lounge access, upgrades, free flights, and reduced \nfares. Although business travellers represented only 12 per \ncent of the market, they accounted for up to 75 per cent of \nprofits on certain routes.6 By 2018, 802 million people trav-\nelled within the European Union (EU) annually.7\nCore airline costs included fuel, aircraft, and wages (see \nExhibit 1), with fuel costs varying substantially over time \n(e.g., fuel costs increased 54 per cent from 2017 to 2018).8 \nProfitability in the wider airline industry varied, with airlines \nthemselves being the least profitable.9 In Europe, airlines \nearned an average of US$6.65 (€5.64)10 per passenger, gener-\nating a margin of 3.37 per cent.11\nAir transport was regulated by the EU. In 1997, the EU \nliberalized its air space,12 giving carriers the right to fly \nanywhere and encouraging countries to negotiate bilateral \nagreements on the management of landing and take-off \nslots and airport capacity.13 Deregulation had three conse-\nquences. First, legacy carriers14 formed hub-and-spoke net-\nworks to increase the number of destinations they served, \nfill their planes, and reduce operating costs.15 Second, the \ncreation of airline alliances made it possible for individual \nCase 2\nAir France–KLM: A Strategy for the European Skies1\nBenjamin Smith was appointed chief executive officer (CEO) \nof French air transport group Air France–KLM SA (Air \nFrance–KLM) in September 2018, after Jean-Marc Janaillac, \nthe incumbent CEO, resigned. The group needed to end \nits losses, and in January 2019, work began to develop the \nfirm’s new vision, to be presented at the forthcoming board \nof director’s meeting.2\nFaced with several challenges, such as low profitability, \nfalling prices, and increasing competition, Air France–KLM \nhad gone from leading the European market in 2004 to fourth \nposition, as local low-cost airlines and high-end emerging \neconomy airlines joined the competition.3 Air France–KLM \nhad created several businesses to challenge the new compe-\ntition but had yet to improve its financial results or increase \nits market share.4 In this changing competitive context, what \ncould Smith do to reassess the strategic role of the group’s \nbusiness units? What strategy could he propose to return the \ngroup to its leadership position?\nThe Air Transport Industry in Europe\nAirline passengers were divided into two categories: lei-\nsure and business.5 The former was typically price sensitive, \nwhile the latter valued flight schedules and service quality. \nCompanies\nSalary \nCosts (%)\nDepreciation  \n(%)\nMaintenance  \n(%)\nOperating \nCosts * (%)\nRoads and \nCharges (%)\nFuel  \n(%)\nAir France–KLM SA\n30.0\n11.1\n9.3\n23.0\n7.3\n19.2\nDeutsche Lufthansa AG\n24.9\n6.2\n5.2\n33.8\n12.6\n17.2\nInternational Airlines Group\n22.7\n10.1\n8.6\n23.3\n10.3\n24.9\nRyanair\n14.7\n9.6\n2.9\n25.3\n11.2\n36.3\neasyJet plc\n14.7\n4.2\n6.1\n44.4\n7.8\n22.9\nExhibit 1 Main Costs of Airlines\nNote: *Operating costs included commercial charges, airport services, aeronautical services, and other unspecified expenses.\nSources: Air France–KLM, Document de référence 2018 (n.p.: Air France KLM Group, 2019), https://www.airfranceklm.com/fr/system/files/document_de_reference_air_france-klm_2018 \n_vf.pdf; Lufthansa Group, Annual Report 2018 (Cologne: Deutsche Lufthansa AG, 2019), https://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/themes/annual-report-2018.html; International Airlines \nGroup, Annual Report 2018 (Harmondsworth, UK: International Airlines Group, 2019), https://www.iairgroup.com/~/media/Files/I/IAG/documents/annual-report-and-accounts-2018 \n-interactive.pdf; Ryanair DAC, Annual Report 2019 (Dublin: Ryanair, 2020), https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ryanair-2019-Annual-Report.pdf; EasyJet Plc,  \nThe Warmest Welcome in the Sky: Annual Report and Accounts 2018 (Bedfordshire, UK: EasyJet Plc, 2019), http://corporate.easyjet.com/~/media/Files/E/Easyjet/pdf/investors/results-centre \n/2018/2018-annual-report-and-accounts.pdf.\nGwyneth Edwards and Paul Marchand wrote this case study solely to provide material for class discussion.

Consequently, airport charges at major European air-\nports doubled.21 By 2018, many European airports were on the \nverge of saturation; the EU estimated that there would be an \novercapacity of 1.9 million flights by 2035 if congestion issues \nwere not resolved.22\nOther industry events also increased competition between \nair and other forms of travel. Given that planes were the most \npolluting mode of transport,23 approximately one in five trav-\nellers claimed to have reduced their air travel out of concern \nfor the environment.24 The EU’s 2009 Shift2Rail initiative, \nwhich aimed to increase rail travel significantly,25 drove the \ndevelopment of Europe’s high-speed rail network, leading \nto a fall in air ridership as train travel times decreased26—in \nsome cases, by as much as 80 per cent.27\nWithin the EU, airline companies were exposed to tax \nsystems, social systems, and regulations that varied between \ncountries. The taxation of airline activities, for example, \nled to decreases in passenger demand, flights, and industry \njobs.28 In 2017 and 2018, the industry experienced a wave of \nlow-cost carrier bankruptcies, while active carriers continued \nto experience significant financial difficulties.29\nCompetition\nDeutsche Lufthansa\nFounded in 1953 and based in Cologne, Germany, Deut-\nsche Lufthansa AG (Lufthansa) had the largest number of \nseats in the European market, at 12.5 per cent at the start \nof 2019 (see Exhibit 2). It was also a member of the Star \nAlliance, which represented 21.7 per cent of the world’s air \ntraffic.30 The firm owned six companies: Lufthansa, Swiss \nInternational Airlines AG, and Austrian Airlines AG made \nup the high-end network segment, while Brussels Airlines, \nGermanwings GmbH, and Eurowings GmbH (Eurowings) \nformed the low-cost (point-to-point) segment.31 Lufthansa \nalso operated three aeronautical service subsidiaries: \nLufthansa Cargo AG, Lufthansa Technik AG, and the LSG \nSky Chefs. In 2018, the turnover breakdown was as follows \n(see Exhibit 3): high-end business (63 per cent), low-cost \nsegment (12 per cent), maintenance services (11 per cent), \nlogistics services (7 per cent), LSG Sky Chefs (7 per cent), \nand other services (2 per cent).32\nThe company’s goal was to remain the first choice for \nshareholders, customers, and employees, based on quality \nof service and strict cost control.33 In 2012, Lufthansa intro-\nduced its “Synergy, Cost, Organization, Revenue, Execution” \n(SCORE) restructuring plan. As part of the plan, Lufthansa \ntransferred all point-to-point flights from Lufthansa to \nEurowings and renegotiated its employee contracts. It \nreduced hierarchical levels, promoted communication \nbetween subsidiaries, and reduced headcount. By 2014, it \nposted an additional revenue of €2.3 billion and focused \non upgrading its high-end businesses.34 From 2017 onward, \nLufthansa was one of the few companies worldwide—and \nthe only European firm—to be certified with five stars by the \nagency Skytrax.35\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG) was \nbased in Madrid, Spain, and was formed through the 2010 \nmerger of British Airways (UK) and Iberia, Líneas Aéreas \nde España, SA Operadora, Sociedad Unipersonal (Iberia) \n(Spain). IAG accounted for 9.2 per cent of the European \nmarket (see Exhibit 2) and was part of the Oneworld alliance, \nwhich accounted for 15.6 per cent of world air traffic.36 IAG \nsubsidiaries included British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, and \ntwo low-cost companies, Vueling Airlines SA and OpenSkies \nSASU (operating as LEVEL). IAG provided its subsidiaries \nwith several commercial services, such as IAG GBS [global \nbusiness services], which delivered digital and information \ntechnology (IT) services; the Avios loyalty program, which \nhad 8.7 million members; IAG MRO [maintenance, repair, \nand overhaul] and Fleet, which provided maintenance ser-\nvices; and IAG Cargo, which transported goods.

The \nfirm’s key activities were passenger transport (88 per cent), \ncommercial services (6.8 per cent), and freight transport  \n(4.8 per cent).37\nIn 2018, IAG’s objective was to become the top company \nin the world by maximizing the creation of value for its \nshareholders and customers (see Exhibit 3).38 It sought to \nextend its dominant position in its main markets (London, \nMadrid, Barcelona, Dublin, and Rome) by offering new \nroutes and establishing new markets with the launch of \nLEVEL long haul in Paris and LEVEL medium haul39 in \nVienna.40\nAfter the merger, Iberia cut 3,800 jobs, reduced the size \nof its fleet, and renegotiated supplier contracts, allowing \nit to compete with low-cost airlines in Spain and capture \nmarket share in the premium long-haul segment.41 British \nAirways renegotiated employment contracts, reduced its \nworkforce, and froze wages for four years.

From 1946 onward, the \ncompany offered luxurious in-flight services that included \nprivate cabins, meals cooked by top chefs, and champagne \nand claimed to be the ambassador of French gastronomy.60 \nIn 1995, the company restructured its hub networks at Par-\nis’s Charles de Gaulle (CDG) and Orly airports. In 2018, 51.4 \nmillion passengers travelled on its airlines, which included \nAir France, Air France Hop (HOP!), Joon SAS, and Transavia \nAirlines SAS (Transavia France).61 Total operating revenue \nwas €166 million with an operating margin of 1.7 per cent \n(see Exhibit 5).\nKLM was launched as the Netherlands’ national airline \nin 1919 and was the oldest airline to continue using its found-\ning brand name.62 KLM’s main hub was located at Schiphol \nAirport in Amsterdam. It managed four subsidiaries: KLM \nCityHopper, for short- and medium-haul flights; Transavia \nAirlines CV (Transavia), in operation since 1966 for low-cost \ntravel; and KLM Cargo and Martinair, for the transport of \ngoods. KLM was the leading airline in the Netherlands, with \nTransavia in second place.63 In 2018, KLM posted an operat-\ning revenue of €1,073 million and an operating margin of 9.8 \nper cent (see Exhibit 5).\nIn May 2004, Air France and KLM merged, creating \na joint venture based in Tremblay-en-France.64 The Air \nFrance–KLM Group held 100 per cent of KLM’s economic \nrights but only 49 per cent of KLM’s voting rights. The \nremaining 51 per cent of voting rights remained in the hands \nof two Dutch foundations (44.84 per cent), the State of the \nNetherlands (5.92 per cent), and other shareholders (0.30 per \ncent).65 Air France–KLM was comprised of two divisions: \nAir France, with 51,707 employees, and KLM, with 29,818 \nLike other low-cost airlines, initially Ryanair offered only \none class of travel to all its passengers, with limited services \n(e.g., checked luggage cost extra). The company also stood \nout from its competitors by operating out of secondary air-\nports46 and regions that experienced lower air traffic, allow-\ning passengers to disembark and board quickly and increas-\ning overall capacity.47\nHowever, although Ryanair claimed it was the most punc-\ntual airline in Europe and experienced the lowest percentage \nof lost baggage and flight cancellations,48 in 2014 it was ranked \nthe second-worst brand in the world.49 In response, in 2014, \nthe firm launched its “Always Getting Better” plan, which \nfocused on additional services for business passengers, such \nas free checked luggage, priority boarding, flexible booking, \nand better seats.50 The firm also allowed for a second piece of \ncabin baggage, reduced the price of printing a boarding pass \nat the airport, and enabled seat reservations.51\nEasyJet\nEasyJet PLC (easyJet) was founded in the United Kingdom \nin 1995 by Stelios Haji-Ioannou, a Greek-Cypriot business-\nperson, and represented 6.3 per cent of the European market  \n(see Exhibit 2).52 Unlike its rival Ryanair, easyJet operated from \nmajor airports in major cities and competed head on with tra-\nditional airlines.\nIn 2008, it launched its annual easyJet Plus subscription, \nwhich allowed members to board first and benefit from \nin-flight services.53 In 2018, it introduced a plan to improve \ncustomer experience and retention by optimizing flight \nschedules for its business class passengers.54 The company \nalso focused on providing passengers with effortless trips and \nthe “the warmest welcome in the sky.”55 It was the first low-\ncost airline to offer a loyalty program.56\nGulf-Based Companies\nIn the long-haul flight segment, Europe faced competition \nfrom Emirates, Qatar Airways Company QCSC, and Etihad \nAirways, Persian Gulf–based carriers that provided a luxury \nexperience for the same price as flights with European-based \ncompanies. From 2004 to 2014, the number of routes between \nEurope and the Gulf countries increased from 23 to 69.57 \nBetween Europe and Asia, first-class travel on these three \nairlines grew 67 per cent, while business class travel grew  \n47 per cent.58 In 2018, Qatar Airways was ranked the sec-\nond-best airline in the world while Emirates was ranked \nfourth (see Exhibit 4). Lufthansa was the only European air-\nline present in the top 10 (in seventh position).\nThe Air France–Klm Merger\nPrior to the Air France–KLM merger, Compagnie Nationale \nAir France (Air France) and Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatsch-\nappij NV (KLM) operated as two independent organizations, \ntargeting business and high-end leisure customers.

Their largest joint \nventures included Delta Air Lines Inc. (USA), Alitalia–Soci-\netà Aerea Italiana SpA (Italy), and Virgin Atlantic Airlines \nLtd. (UK), which dominated the transatlantic market.75\nThe Air France–KLM Group’s ambition was to become \nthe European aviation leader and one of the world’s lead-\ning airlines through social and environmental responsibil-\nity.76 The group was recognized for making its planes more \nenergy efficient and for using biofuels. For 10 straight years, \nthe group held the top spot in the Dow Jones Sustainabil-\nity Index Airlines category.77 Following the eurozone crisis \n(2009–2011), Air France–KLM experienced an intensification \nof competition, facing price pressure from both low-cost com-\npetitors and traditional competitors such as British Airways \nand Lufthansa. Emerging economy organizations (e.g., Turk-\nish Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and the Gulf-based compa-\nnies) also exerted pressure on long-haul flights through their \npremium services. In this increasingly complex market, new \nstrategies were required for each of the group’s subsidiaries.78\nThe Air France Division\nAir France\nUntil 2013, Air France operated under one brand, target-\ning the business and high-end leisure traveller. It had the \nlargest long-haul network in Europe. In response to the \nemployees. In 2018, through its 548 aircraft (see Exhibit 6), \nthe group earned 93 per cent of its revenue from air passen-\nger and freight transport and 7 per cent from maintenance \nactivities, with a total revenue of €26.5 billion (see Exhibit 7). \nThe increase in the price of oil and strikes occurring in 2018 \nnegatively impacted the group’s revenue.66\nAir France–KLM focused on three activities: passenger \nand freight transport, low-cost passenger transport, and \naircraft maintenance. The group’s head office managed sev-\neral departments common to the two divisions, including \nfinance, sales and alliances, commercial strategy, engineering \nand maintenance, cargo, IT, and the general secretariat. The \ngroup managed pricing, sales, and commercial alliances for \nall its airlines. It also managed the tiered loyalty program, \nFlying Blue, which had 15 million members.67 The program \nallowed members travelling with the group to accumulate \npoints, which were exchangeable for tickets, upgrades, or \nin-flight options. Platinum status benefits included priority \nboarding and access to private airport lounges.68 In 2018, Air \nFrance–KLM carried 101.8 million passengers,69 of which 60 \nper cent travelled for leisure and 40 per cent for business; 55 \nper cent were Flying Blue members.70\nAir France was a founding member of the SkyTeam alli-\nance, which accounted for 16.1 per cent of world air traffic,71 \nallowing the group to increase its network to 1,150 destina-\ntions in 177 countries.72 Air France–KLM alone had the larg-\nest long-haul network in Europe.73 The alliance also allowed \nmember airlines to co-coordinate flights, sales, ground \noperations, and loyalty programs.74 The group also formed \nExhibit 6 Air France–KLM Fleet—number of Aircraft, 2018\nNote: * Includes HOP! and Joon.\nSource: Air France–KLM, Registration Document 2018, Air France KLM Group, 2019, https://www.airfranceklm.com/en/system/files/registration_document_air_france-klm_2018_va_def.pdf.\nAircraft\nAir \nFrance*\nKLM\nTransavia \nFrance\nTransavia \nNL\nOwned\nFinance \nLease\nOperating \nLease\nTotal\nLong Haul\n106\n66\n–\n–\n69\n32\n71\n172\nMedium Haul\n115\n50\n34\n40\n77\n28\n134\n239\nRegional\n82\n49\n–\n–\n60\n33\n38\n131\nCargo\n2\n4\n–\n–\n6\n–\n–\n6\nTotal\n305\n169\n34\n40\n212\n93\n243\n548\nExhibit 5 Financial Results for Air France and Klm\nSources: Air France KLM Group, “Full Year 2018 Results,” press release, Air France–KLM, February 20, 2019, https://www.airfranceklm.com/sites/default/files/q4_2018_press_release \n_en_vdef_0.pdf; Air France KLM Group, “Full Year 2016 Results,” press release, Air France–KLM, February 16, 2017, https://www.airfranceklm.com/sites/default/files/communiques \n/fy_2016_press_release_en.pdf; Air France KLM Group, “Full Year 2014 Results,” press release, Air France–KLM, February 19, 2015, https://www.airfranceklm.com/sites/default/files \n/communiques/2014-q4_press_release_en_def.pdf.\nOperating Costs  \n(€ millions) and \nMargin (%)\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nAir France Division\n−174 (−1.0%)\n−314 (−2.0%)\n426 (2.6%)\n372 (2.4%)\n588 (3.7%)\n266 (1.7%)\nKLM Division\n301 (3.0%)\n175 (1.8%)\n384 (3.9%)\n681 (6.9%)\n910 (8.8%)\n1,073 (9.8%)\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The strikes \ncaused flight delays and trip cancellations, leading to a loss \nof €335 million. 85 The Air France–KLM CEO at the time, \nJanaillac, resigned.86 By the end of 2018, Air France’s Net \nPromoter Score87 was 18 out of a possible 50 points and the \nairline was ranked 70th (of 87) on the list of most punctual \nairlines.88 According to Skytrax, Air France was the 25th best \ncompany in the world, down 10 spots from 2015.89 Despite \n73 per cent of French citizens holding a positive opinion of \nchanging industry landscape, Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of \nAir France from 2012 to 2016, launched two strategic plans: \n“Transform 2015” and “Perform 2020.”79 In 2014, Perform \n2020 was launched to target a greater share of the business \nand premium economy markets by increasing the number \nof seats in business and premium economy classes, which \nwere respectively 1.5 and 3.0 times more profitable than econ-\nomy class. The intent of “Transform 2015” was to enable the \ngroup’s companies, particularly Air France, to become com-\npetitive again in the European market. The group cut 2,800 \nAir France jobs and increased the subcontracting of opera-\ntions in French airports, a practice usually done by low cost \ncompanies.80 Air France regional flights were transferred to a \nnew business, HOP! In 2014, Perform 2020 was launched to \ntarget a greater share of the business and premium economy \nmarkets by increasing the number of seats in the business \nand premium economy classes, respectively 1.5 and 3.0 times \nmore profitable than economy class.81\n (in € millions)\n2018\n2017\n2016\n2015\n2014\nTurnover\n26,515\n25,864\n24,844\n25,689\n24,912\nOther Activity Income\nProduct Activity Ordinary\n3\n26,515\n3\n25,867\n2\n24,846\n2\n25,691\n18\n24,930\nExternal Charges\nStaff Costs\nTaxes and Duties\nOther Income and Expenses\nEBITDA*\n(15,224)\n(7,759)\n(166)\n851\n4,217\n(14,188)\n(7,620)\n(158)\n862\n4,763\n(14,243)\n(7,474)\n(164)\n842\n3,787\n(15,768)\n(7,464)\n(155)\n1,110\n3,414\n(15,791)\n(7,316)\n(169)\n(65)\n1,589\nOperational Rents (Aircraft)\nEBITDA\n–\n–\n(1,073)\n2,714\n(1,027)\n2,387\n–\nDepreciation, Impairment, and Provisions\nCurrent Operating Results\n(2,885)\n1,332\n(2,840)\n1,923\n(1,665)\n1,049\n(1,607)\n780\n(1,718)\n(129)\nDisposal of Aeronautical Equipment\nOther Income and Expenses Non-Current\nResults of Operational Activities\n4\n(16)\n1,320\n18\n(1,925)\n 16\n21\n46\n1,116\n(5)\n305\n1,080\n–\n880\n751\nCost of Gross Financial Debt\nCash Income and Cash Equivalents\n(465)\n39\n(570)\n34\n(309)\n49\n(372)\n62\n(446)\n76\nCost of Net Financial Debt\n(426)\n(536)\n(260)\n(310)\n(370)\nOther Financial Income and Expenses\nPre-Tax Profit of Integrated Companies\n(271)\n623\n649\n129\n(33)\n823\n(604)\n166\n(318)\n63\nTaxes\n(227)\n21\n(294)\n(30)\n(209)\nNet Income from Discontinued Operations\nNet Profit\n–\n411\n(8)\n163\n270\n792\n26\n127\n(4)\n(189)\nExhibit 7 Consolidated Financial Results for Air France–Klm\nNote: *EBITDA = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\nSources: Air France–KLM, Document de référence 2018, Air France KLM Group, 2019, https://www.airfranceklm.com/fr/system/files/document_de_reference_air_france-klm_2018_vf.pdf; \nAir France–KLM, Reference Document 2016 [in French], Air France KLM Group, 2017, https://www.airfranceklm.com/sites/default/files/publications/afk_amf.pdf; and Air France–KLM, \nReference Document 2014 [in French], Air France KLM Group, 2015, https://www.airfranceklm.com/sites/default/files/publications/afklm_doc_de_reference_2014_fr.pdf.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

We have the ambition to become the most focused \nEuropean airline to customers, most innovative and most \neffective.”106 As part of the plan, the firm launched “KLM \nCompass,” a program aimed at retaining employees and rais-\ning their awareness of the company’s mission and values, \nemployee responsibilities, client expectations, and the prin-\nciples of leadership.107 In an effort to increase productivity, \nin partnership with employees and with the support of new \ntechnologies, organizational hierarchy levels were reduced \nand employees were given more responsibility.108\nIn 2016, KLM launched “Digital Studio” to improve cus-\ntomer service and operational efficiency.109 The firm used \ntechnology to track baggage locations, decrease losses, and \nenable faster baggage offloading in the event of a passenger’s \nabsence. In addition, to provide competitive customer ser-\nvice, 9,500 cabin crew and ground staff were given tablets \nand access to “Appy2Help,” which provided access to cus-\ntomer profiles (e.g., birthday information). Appy2Help also \nprovided information on connecting flights and allowed pas-\nsengers to be checked in and assigned seats, compensated in \nthe event of a broken-down plane, and rebooked in the case \nof a schedule disruption.110 Other applications that focused on \nimproving operational efficiency included Bax@Risk, which \ncould predict which passengers were in danger of missing a \nflight, and PLUG, which optimized aircraft parking. Digital \nStudio apps reduced delays and maximized aircraft use.111\nKLM was present on all social networking platforms, \nsupported by the largest digital team in the industry  \n(300 employees).112 The platforms used artificial intelligence  \nto provide customer service including packing instructions \nand information on checking luggage size in 10 languages.113 \nKLM was also the first company to sell tickets on Facebook \nMessenger (2016) and the first non-Chinese company to autho-\nrize payments via WeChat (2018).114 Through social media, \ncustomers could upgrade their seats or buy in-flight services. \nKLM also moved upmarket with “World Business Class,” \nwhich provided more services and access to the Schiphol Air-\nport lounge.115 KLM was considered to be one of the best com-\npanies, globally, with a Net Promoter Score of 42.116\nThe Transavia Business\nIn service in the Netherlands since 1966, and in France since \n2007, Transavia operated 225 lines in Europe and North \nAfrica.117 As the group’s low-cost carrier, it maximized capac-\nity while offering simplicity in service and pricing through \na light management model and significant outsourcing of \nactivities.118 In 2014, Air France–KLM launched Transavia \nEurope to open new hubs in Portugal and Germany and \nattempted to renegotiate pilot and crew contracts to save on \ncosts. In response, Air France pilots launched a strike, leading \nto €330 million in losses.119 The group abandoned the project, \ndeciding instead to further develop Transavia France. The \nunions supported a maximum increase of 40 aircraft on Air \nFrance routes.120\nthe firm, 43 per cent felt that Air France’s image had deteri-\norated and 83 per cent said that their fares were excessive.90\nHOP!\nIn 2013, as part of Transform 2015, HOP! was created as a \nseparately managed, single-class airline dedicated to regional \nflights. HOP! flew Air France passengers from regional air-\nports into the CDG hub, enabling long-haul connections from \nacross France. The airline also flew point to point between \nFrench cities,91 focusing on the busier airports and adapting to \nthe schedule needs of business customers.92 HOP! also offered \ncustomers low prices, particularly with flexible price grids,93 \nalong with a self-service website. The logo included Air France \nin small print. All flights qualified for Flying Blue miles.94\nIn addition to HOP!’s offerings, Air France offered several \nshort-haul options. For example, passengers could book both \nplane and train travel on the Air France website by choosing \nfrom 13 possible rail routes to and from CDG.95 First-class \nand business travellers who were provided the equivalent rail \ntravel class, could earn Flying Blue points, and were entitled \nto free taxi transfers between the airport and rail station.96 \nDespite the desire to provide lower prices to its customers, \nHOP! was often criticized for its high prices.97 In 2018, the \nshort-haul network recorded losses of about €170 million.98\nJoon\nIn 2017, as part of the Trust Together program, Air France–\nKLM created Joon, also independently managed within the \nAir France division, to operate 18 medium- and long-haul \nroutes where Air France was experiencing losses.99 Joon’s \ncrews were paid less than Air France crews, and operating \ncosts were 13 per cent lower.100 The airline targeted the 18- \nto 35-year-old segment, which was price sensitive but also \nin search of comfort.101 It offered several travel classes and \non-board services such as Wi-Fi and in-flight entertainment. \nIt also offered a menu that included detox drinks, craft beer, \norganic products, and tapas.102 When Joon was launched, Air \nFrance–KLM’s CEO defined it as a “long-haul company with \nlower costs” that stood for “comfort, business class travel, \nflexibility, attractive offers, modern chic, relaxed, eco respon-\nsible, digital.”103 Business class passengers experienced the \nsame level of service as on Air France, while economy class \nservices came at an additional cost. Within a year of service, \nJoon flew at 90 per cent capacity.104\nThe Klm Division\nAs one of the oldest traditional airlines, KLM, like Air France, \nalso targeted the business and high-end leisure traveller. In \n2014, a veteran KLM employee of 21 years, Pieter Elbers, was \nappointed as chair of the KLM management board. The focus \nwas on reducing costs, investing in the future, and transform-\ning the organization with the intention of increasing profit-\nability and flexibility while becoming more customer-cen-\ntric.105 KLM’s chief operating officer, René de Groot (also a \nveteran employee of 24 years) stated, “We have determined \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The firm \nmanaged over 500 conversations through the social network-\ning platforms per day.122 In 2018, it transported 15 million \npeople, who could earn Flying Blue miles, to France and the \nNetherlands; was awarded for its reservation service; and was \nranked first as the most punctual company in Europe.

MYbank on the other hand \nhad largely focused on rural small, micro, and medium sized \nenterprises (SMEs) and farmers, and had serviced around 45 \nmillion SMEs and rural clients since its inception. There were \nalso a few other private online banks operating in China, and \ncompetition was tough. The senior executives at MYbank had \narranged brainstorming sessions to understand how the firm \ncould tackle disruption, beat competition and incorporate a \ntechnology-led growth model while staying true to its vision.\nAdditionally, other business issues like the negative after \neffects of the pandemic and ongoing regulatory challenges \nrequired contemplation as well. During and after the pan-\ndemic, rural micro-lenders in China had faced adverse eco-\nnomic conditions, and MYbank had cut interest rates for its \nmicro loans in 2020 and 2021 to help its customers cope, while \nusing strategies like cost optimisation and economies of scale \nto offset the impact of interest cuts on profits. MYbank’s Pres-\nident, Jin Xiaolong shared,\nIn the past three years, the recurrence of epidemics and \nthe danger of disasters caused by extreme weather have \nled to a slowdown in the growth of some consumer sec-\ntors, which has directly affected the business environment \nof small and micro groups… In this context, it is even \nmore necessary for financial institutions to increase scien-\ntific and technological exploration and increase support \nfor small and micro-operators. So, what is the next step \nin technological development for SME finance? In my \nopinion, it is necessary to continue to follow the original \naspiration of providi ng financial credit services for every \nsmall and micro businesses operating with integrity.\nSeparately, the macro-economic trends of China had pre-\ndicted slower growth in 2022, due to several factors including \ndebt problems of major property developers, resurge of \nCOVID-19 infections, contraction of onshore manufactur-\ning activity and softened export demand. It was expected \nthat the aggregate net profit of China’s commercial  \nbanks would grow around 10% in 2022 compared to 12.6% \nin 2021.\nHowever, despite the challenges, expectations were \nupbeat, as MYbank had reported a year-on-year growth of \n31.6% for the first quarter of 2022. The loans and advances for \nthe period from January to March 2022 had totalled a stag-\ngering US$30 billion (RMB189.1 billion4).5 Even so, executives \nin the company knew that continued growth could only come \nthrough careful strategic planning.\nIndustrywide, sustainable banking services6 had also \nbecome prevalent in other parts of the world to develop \nfinancial products and services, meet the needs of the people \nat the bottom of the pyramid (BoP) and safeguard the envi-\nronment while generating profit. Many governments and \nfirms were implementing the triple bottom line of People, \nPlanet and Profit7 to ‘do good’ using environment and social \nassessment guidelines for negative screening within the lend-\ning process. Yet, unlike MYbank, very few banks had adjusted \ninterest rates based on their borrowers’ business performance \nduring downturns.\nTraditionally, banking had always paid more atten-\ntion to high-net-worth individuals (HNWI), focussed on \nfewer accounts, and one-on-one relationships. However, \nMYbank had focused on technology to enable quick trans-\nactions, a large volume of customers over a few customers \nof high financial standing, and lower operational costs to \ncreate a sustainable business model. The objective was to \nuse automation, standardisation, and artificial intelligence \n(AI) to reach a very large number of small customers at \nthe BoP.\nCould MYbank adopt a low margin, high volume model \nlike assembly line business models to target large swathes \nof the rural population and pull them up the BoP pyramid? \nCould MYbank become the McDonald’s of rural, digital \nbanking? Separately, could it beat competition to stay ahead \nin the cut-throat online banking business?\nRural China and Agricultural Finance\nMYbank’s home base, China, had over the past few decades \nrisen in economic rankings and emerged as a global leader \nin world economics. However, China had also a large BoP \npopulation (239 million adults in 2015), making it the world’s \nThis case was written by Professor Heli Wang and Lipika Bhattacharya at the Singapore Management University.

Thus, rural develop-\nment and food production was a huge concern and formed a \nkey part of the country’s policy.\nTo put it in perspective, China had 9% of the world’s \narable land to feed its people (20% of the world’s population) \nin contrast to the US, which had 16.5% of the world’s arable \nland to feed its people (4% of the world’s population).11 Geo-\ngraphically only 13% of the total land in China was arable, \nand that too faced constant pressure due to heavy industri-\nalisation and urban encroachment. The Chinese government \nhad introduced strict farmland protection measures and \ndrawn “red lines” to protect the country’s farmlands from \nindustrial encroachment.12\nOver the past decade, China had tried to ramp-up its \nown food production to reduce its dependency on imports \nby introducing higher-yield grains, improved farming tech-\nniques, and privatisation policies to incentivise farmers. \nHowever, the country still lagged in yield and food safety \nrelative to developed countries with robust agriculture sec-\ntors. In addition, ageing rural demographics, environmental \ndegradation, climate change, groundwater depletion, heavy \nmetal pollution and a lack of technological adoption also \nposed challenges to its agricultural sector, which employed \naround 350 million people as of 2021.13 In its annual central \nrural conference in Beijing in 2021, China had pledged con-\ncrete measures to consolidate the agriculture sector, advance \nrural vitalisation, and analyse existing issues related to agri-\nculture, rural businesses, and farmers.14\nHistorically the country’s agricultural policy had allowed \neven distribution of arable land amongst farmers to guar-\nantee employment and livelihood. Farmers were given col-\nlective land ownership rights by the state, resulting in frag-\nmented land plots that made large-scale agribusiness difficult \nto execute without land transfers.15 As a result, over 98% of \nfarmers in the country operated small-scale farms averaging \nless than 6 square km (in comparison, the average US farm \nsize was about 1,800 square km).16 Small farm holdings and \nlack of sufficient rural finance made investment in large-scale \nagriculture technology economically less viable. Moreover, \nvaried soil quality, water, temperature, and climate in differ-\nent regions made standardised and unified production pro-\ncesses harder to implement and scale up nationally.\nAnalysts had predicted China’s demand for food to \nincrease by 60% by 2050, but its agricultural system was \nalready under pressure to satisfy current demand and the \nonly way to increase food production beyond existing levels \nwas to invest in sustainable technologies and climate-smart \nagriculture.17 Yet financing the agricultural sector to help \nupgrade to sustainable technologies presented many chal-\nlenges for financial institutions. These challenges encom-\npassed high costs of reaching remote rural areas, weather \nrisks, issues with scattered crop concentration, and price \nvolatility, which in turn increased the credit risk for lenders \nlike banks, reducing their appetite for the sector. Financing \nthe agricultural sector required integral risk-management \nstrategies and formed a key agenda of inclusive finance strat-\negies implemented by the Chinese government.18\nThe Rise of Inclusive Finance\nThe term ‘Inclusive Finance’ had gained popularity since \nthe early 2000s and was first discussed at length at a \nUnited Nations conference in 2005. The purpose of Inclu-\nsive Finance was to make financial services more accessi-\nble to low-income people while promoting sustainability \nand green rural development.19 The concept had originally \nemerged from the analysis of challenges posed by the \nunequal distribution of wealth across the world, which was \nmore or less in line with the 80/20 Pareto principle.20 In \nChina, the equation was similar, i.e., traditional banking \ninstitutions were focused on 20% of the customers (high-\nvalue clients) who controlled 80% of the country’s wealth \nand resources.21 The remaining 80% of the population \n(which included 45% of the country’s population in rural \nareas) had marginalised income, and found it harder to get \nformal credit access.22 This was partly due to the high over-\nhead costs of branch banking which forced banks to focus \nonly on market segments that offered the highest margins. \nBesides, only one third of the population in China had \ncredit records while the rest were ‘credit invisible’ and loans \nin rural areas accounted for only 23% of the country’s total \nloan balance.23\nThe rural credit statistics had motivated the govern-\nment as well as international organisations like the World \nBank (WB) to take action. WB had established an initiative \nin China in 2016, to extend loans to farmers and promote  \nclimate-smart, sustainable agriculture.24 The initiative tried \nto implement mitigation and adaptation measures to address \nthe impacts of climate change by providing incentives to \nproducers to apply innovative, sustainable, solutions.25 Prior \nto this, China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) \nhad introduced new regulations in 2014, to promote Inclu-\nsive Finance and allow privately-owned organisations like \nMYbank to operate in the banking sector to serve the rural \npopulation. This decision of the government was motivated \nby the rapid proliferation of the internet and smartphones in \nrural China.\nNotably, as of 2015, 49% of the country’s population were \nactive internet users, internet penetration amongst the rural \npopulation was 30%, and promotion and sales of agricultural \nproducts on internet using e-commerce was commonplace.26 \nSmartphone acquisition in rural China was also high and had \nrisen further (from 32% in 2015 to 46%) by 2019.27 Besides, \nthe online retail market in China was the largest in the \nworld (since 2013), with Alibaba at its forefront as the largest  \ne-commerce player.28\nThe new banking regulations in China (introduced in \n2014) had allowed private banks to operate in the country \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Prior to this regulation, private investors \nwere not allowed to be stakeholders of banking institu-\ntions. Five online-only banks were licensed under the new \nregulations—namely, Tencent backed WeBank, Ant Group \nbacked MYbank, Baidu backed AiBank, Xiaomi backed XW \nbank, and Suning backed Suning Finance.29 The policy intent \nwas to allow the experimentation of new, completely online, \nbanking models to improve available capital for small busi-\nnesses and encourage economic growth in a way that state-\nowned banks were not set up to provide. Regulators were also \neager to see if online banks could support economic growth \nin rural regions far from the main cities.30\nMYbank\nMYbank was established in 2015 by Ant Financial and its \npartners with the vision of empowering rural entrepreneurs \nthrough financial services. It was among the first batch of pri-\nvate commercial banks in China to use technologies like data \nanalytics and AI to provide efficient services to its custom-\ners. The name MYbank was curated based on the company’s \n‘do good’ vision to provide financial inclusion and a sense \nof empowerment to its small business borrowers, and was \nbased on the belief that banking services could be provided \nonline to the rural population at a higher efficiency, lower \ncost and wider coverage as compared to branch banking. It \naimed to create ‘shared value’ through a business model that \ncould achieve social benefits without sacrificing corporate \nsuccess and profits—using technology as its magic wand to \nfulfil this objective. The syllables ‘MY’ in MYbank were part \nof its brand design to attract rural SMEs and make them feel \nmore attached to the bank.\nInitially, MYbank was authorised to make loans only and \nnot accept deposits, as regulators wanted to first evaluate the \nefficacy of private ownership modes and the implications of \nonline banking services. Wang Jian, Chief Algorithm Expert \nfor rural finance at MYbank recalled,\nPrior to MYbank, we had started a division known as \nAli Microloans (阿里小贷), which focused on financial \nservices for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Then \naround 2015, we formally set up MYbank to serve SMEs. \nOur initial concept was akin to a system of fine capillar-\nies, which could deeply penetrate rural China and deliver \nfinancial service to many SMEs across all provinces.\nTo deliver its services online, MYbank, focussed on hiring \nresources who mainly worked on high-tech development, \nuser-centred design (USD), risk modelling, and operations.31 \nIt did not have client managers or branches, but instead \nused internet-based interactions with customers during the \ntransaction process. Initially it catered to SMEs and sellers \nacross the country engaging with the Alibaba e-commerce \nplatforms (including Taobao and T-Mall). The duration of \nthe loans, on average, was approximately up to 90 days and \ncustomers could flexibly borrow money and pay back the \nloans on a rolling basis. However, the majority of the loans \napproved were not made based on consumer credit history or \ncollateral—which many small businesses, particularly those \nrun by women, did not have. Instead, they were approved by \nan automated risk profiling algorithm using what MYbank \ncalled its ‘310’ lending model, wherein it took only three min-\nutes for a customer to apply for a loan, one second for the \nsystem to approve the loan, and the whole process involved \nzero human interaction (refer to Exhibit 1 for Key Metrics of \nMYbank’s ‘310’ model).\n310 Lending Model\nThe ‘310’ lending model included more than 100,000 risk pro-\nfiling metrics and 100 credit risk models specifically suited \nto SME and individual lending which were developed over a \nperiod of time and subjected to iterative testing and refining. \nThe platform assessed loan applications using built-in algo-\nrithms to weigh the risk parameters.

The algorithms used data of consumer \nrepayment records from e-commerce platforms like Alibaba \nand Alipay, customer smartphone payment records, regis-\ntered online customer profiles, e-commerce transactions, \nlocal government records and insurance records. However, \nby principle, they followed the rule of only using the min-\nimum amount of personal information to make optimised \nrisk-related lending decisions and adopted data privacy pro-\ntection measures to protect consumer data. The algorithms \ncould also assess monthly sales of small businesses and pre-\ndict their repayment patterns in the future (refer to Exhibit 2 \nfor a Snapshot of MYbank’s Risk Controls).\nThe lending model helped stimulate loan approval rates, \nwhich quickly rose to four times of traditional lenders (who \ntypically rejected 80% of SME loan requests and took at least \n30 days to process the applications), and also helped con-\ntrol MYbank’s average non-performing loan (NPL) ratio at \naround 1%.\nThe average loan amount granted to consumers was \nUS$4,850 (RMB 34,000) and about 8.66% of the loan appli-\ncations were submitted between 11 pm and 4 am, when tra-\nditional banks in China were closed for business, reflecting \nthe need of anytime financial access by small entrepreneurs. \nMYbank also tried to support green business practises by \nExhibit2 Snapshot of Mybank’s Risk Controls\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Notably, 60% of MYbank’s total liabilities \nwere due to interbank funding.37\nIn 2018, MYbank reported its first net profit of US$96 \nmillion (RMB 670 million), with a return on assets (ROA) of \n0.8%. By 2019, the bank had gained a market share of close \nto half of all SMEs in China, and about 78% of these custom-\ners were first-time borrowers (refer to Exhibit 3 for MYbank \nCustomer Growth). Female SME owners accounted for 40% \nSource: Company Data\nof the customers served.38 MYbank’s innovation and success \nin the SME market became a strong motivation for other \nChinese banks to boost their SME lending.

The first farmer loan \nprogram was launched in mid-2015 to provide credit loans to \nrural farmers who planted crops, bred animals, or ran small \nagricultural businesses and featured streamlined application \nprocedures and a speedy approval process. The farmer loans \nalso followed the ‘310’ lending model, and were delivered in \ncollaboration with numerous financial institutions which \nserved as sources of capital.40 Users could borrow and repay \nat any time, and interest was calculated based on the duration \nof the loan. There were no penalty interest charges or fees for \nearly repayment, and the credit limit amount was restored \nin real time for the customer, once the repayment was made \n(refer to Exhibit 4 for an example of a MYbank serviced \nfarmer lender).\nRural Finance Division\nMYbank also set up a rural finance division to provide cus-\ntomer support and assistance to its rural customers; the divi-\nsion’s aim was to integrate the entire portfolio of micro-fi-\nnancial services including payment, wealth management, \ninsurance, financing and credit, and work closely with Ali-\nbaba’s rural Taobao programme and smart logistics network \nCainiao.\nAlibaba’s Taobao programme had engaged rural entre-\npreneurs to open online shops on the Taobao Marketplace \nand had seen huge success. The rural Taobao program had \nexpanded rapidly, from 212 villages in 12 counties in 2014 to \nmore than 30,000 villages in 1,000 counties by 2018.41 The \nExhibit 4 Mybank Farmer Loans\nFarmer Kai can now easily circle his farmland on the mobile phone, authorize the produce data and apply for an agricultural loan \nfrom MYbank.\nSource: Company Data\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

It did \nnot do well in its first year, accumulating a bad debt of \naround US$8.95 million (RMB 60 million).42 This was pri-\nmarily because it relied on Alibaba’s rural Taobao agents \nfor credit risk assessment, which presented many risks like \nmisjudgement by the human agent, non-payment due to \nfailure of the lender’s business and instances of fraud due \nto human involvement.\nAdditionally, there were a few biases within the division, \nlike a general assumption that rural people were much poorer \nthan city dwellers and did not have the willingness to repay. \nHowever, after several field visits, the team found that many \nof the rural farmers had a decent annual income and were \nsupporting their children studying in cities and towns. They \nalso found that the non-performing rate of farmer loans was \nactually lower than other loans, and that farmers were no \nless trustworthy than city dwellers. The real issue was the lack \nof customised solutions that could service them, and these \nwere tricky to build as many farmers did not have any form \nof online credit history. Besides, many farmers felt humili-\nated to apply for loans, as they felt it reflected that they were \nnot doing well financially or were facing a family problem/\nurgency.\nOn further research, the MYbank team found that \nthere was secondary data available on farmers in existing \ndocuments (such as land rights, land contracts, crop seed \nsubsidy distribution files, and farming machinery pur-\nchase invoices), which were public information and could \nbe potentially used to assess a farmer’s credit worthiness. \nThe challenge was to assemble such information, and it was \nbelieved that this could be done through computing and \nalgorithms.\nInitially, MYbank experimented the usage of drones to \nhelp deliver farmer loans. However, the cost of using drones \nwas relatively high and it was difficult to popularise the tech-\nnology across the country.43 Later, the bank adopted AI and \nsatellite technology to service the loans.\nBy end 2016, the farmer loan service expanded to 1,000 \nvillages and 65 counties across 28 provinces. The loans were \nunsecured and worth US$7,462 (RMB 50,000) each on aver-\nage, involved flexible repayment terms of six, twelve, or \ntwentyfour months (slightly longer than other MYbank \nloans), and accepted various repayment methods (including \ncash and electronic payments).\nAI for Farmer Loans\nTo deliver the farmer loans, MYbank combined its ‘310’ model \nwith its in-house AI-based system called ‘Tomtit’, whose name \nwas inspired by the rural songbirds. The technology was \nbased on satellite remote sensing and image recognition. To \napply for a loan, farmers would download the MYbank app \non their mobile phone, authorise the application for informa-\ntion inquiry, identify their farmlands by selecting their farm-\nland plot (also known as the act of ‘circling’ in Chinese), and \nthen receive loans within a few minutes. As part of the risk \ncontrol process, the Tomtit system checked for pre-existing  \nrecords of the applicant on other platforms like Alibaba’s \nTaobao and Alipay to create an accurate understanding of \nthe customer’s financial situation.\nUsing publicly available satellite images and the image \nof the farmers’ self-authenticated crop field (‘circled’ farm-\nland), data on climate, industry patterns, land registration \ndata from government agencies and information about fac-\ntors affecting price and expected crop growth, Tomtit could \nestimate the yield and output value of the selected land and \naccurately evaluate risk.\nThe unambiguous risk analysis method allowed Tomtit \nto assess and grant reasonable levels of credit and an appro-\npriate repayment plan to the farmers based on the risk scores \ngenerated.\nSatellite Technology\nFollowing the loan disbursement, the farmlands were con-\nstantly monitored by Tomtit using satellite images to assess \nthe growth/condition of the crops and predict any likely risks \nof loan default or additional capital requirements during the \nharvest season (Refer to Exhibit 5 for a Pictorial Demonstra-\ntion of Satellite Technology for Farmer Loans).\nA spectral recognition technology was applied to the \nsatellite images to identify the type and growth status of the \ncrops. The satellite images were updated frequently in real \ntime in a cycle of five to seven days. The frequent monitoring \nof the croplands enabled the bank to make precise assess-\nments, and proactively manage the risks on the loans. It also \nhelped build trust between the bank and the farmers, as the \naccuracy of the deductions were high, and farmers knew that \nthe loans were being approved based on the actual condition \nof their farms. While agricultural finance had been available \nto farmers through traditional banking earlier, it was not as \nconvenient, and entailed monitoring of farmland through \ninstitutional visits to the fields, which were time-consuming, \nexpensive to conduct and required a large number of trained \nemployees. Frequent monitoring with satellites made the pro-\ncess faster, cheaper, more accurate and transparent.\nMYbank mostly used low and medium-resolution satel-\nlite images from optical satellites, which were then processed \nby Tomtit AI recognition and deep learning algorithms, to \neliminate cloud interference and identify the crops accurately. \nThe lower resolution images were cheaper but had higher \nrequirements in terms of obtaining training samples, training \nmodel parameters, and other AI and big data processing capa-\nbilities. After integrating the images with algorithm models \nfrom multiple data sources, the Tomtit platform was able to \nachieve more than 93% accuracy in crop species recognition.\nThere were two key challenges to using satellite imagery, \nhowever. One was the cost factor—high-resolution images \nwere expensive, and low-resolution images required a lot of \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The second challenge was to \nsolve the problem of differentiating similar crops. China had \na vast geography with varying agricultural conditions—for \nexample, the reflected spectrum of corn grown in north-\nern China could be similar to some weeds or rice grown in \nsouthern China, which challenged the remote sensing classi-\nfication algorithms. To address such issues, MYbank used an \nagricultural knowledge map to optimise crop identification \nusing common-sense information sources such as terrain, \nprecipitation, accumulated temperature, commonly grown \ncrops in the region and historical crop data.\nMonitoring farmlands with satellite image processing not \nonly helped minimise credit default risks of farmer loans, but also \nsignificantly eased the “analytics burden” of financial experts at \nMYbank, through access to close-to-real-time data from fields. \nIn addition, there were several other benefits of such technology \ndriven farmer loans that encompassed both environmental and \nsocial benefits, outside the equation of the business itself.\nBenefits of Farmer Loans\nIndustry observers had opined that MYbank farmer loans \ncould contribute significantly to China’s agricultural develop-\nment due to several reasons. 44 Firstly, they could help farmers \nimprove crop yield by allowing them to invest in equipment, \nseeds, fertilisers and other crop-growing tools and imple-\nment sustainable farming practices.45 Secondly, they could \npotentially bring rural small holding farmers out of the pov-\nerty cycle, and benefit the overall economy.46 Thirdly, they \ncould dissuade farmers from taking loans from loan sharks \nand rural moneylenders who would charge them exorbitant \ninterest rates, often forcing them into a destructive cycle of \nmore loans and repayments and abject poverty. Fourthly, \nthey could allow the bank to collect useful information on \nfarmer-consumers, who were hitherto outside the financial \nsystem due to their unique needs.47 Finally, they allowed the \ngovernment to promote inclusive finance and sustainable \nagricultural practices for farmers conveniently with minimal \nsetup costs.48\nMYbank tried to solve the big problem of access, and \nalmost 80% of its users were first-time loan seekers. For the \nfarming community, MYbank’s interest rates were lower than \nother options available to them. However, executives in the \nbank had observed that the main concern of rural agricultural \nlenders was turnover, and not interest rate, as the demand for \nfunds of such users was relatively urgent.\nAlso, because the borrowing cycle for the loans was short, \nthe users were relatively less sensitive to interest rates and \nmore concerned about quick access, convenience of get-\nting the loan and repayment, and whether the loan amount \ngranted was sufficient to meet their needs. Elaborating on the \nbenefits, Wang explained,\nThe traditional banks largely serve the top-tier customers \nin rural communities, who are rich farmers with large \nfarmlands. According to industry estimates, in terms \nof person-hours and expenditure, it costs one or two \nthousand yuan (for a bank representative) to drive down \nto meet a user to initiate a transaction. Our customer base \nis focused on small scale farmers and agro businesses, \nwhere competition is not particularly intense yet.\nThe rural consumer group itself is relatively complex, and \nits complexity is reflected in several dimensions. The first \nis the complexity of China’s geographical environment: in \nsome plain areas of the North for example, the fields are \nmainly grain producing. In some mountainous areas in the \nsouth, mostly fruit trees or highland vegetables are grown. \nIn Shandong or Hebei (in north-east), for example, fruits \nsuch as pears and peaches are grown. Such variations lead \nto a relatively complex industrial structure. In addition, \nthe structure of the agricultural production sector further \nstratifies the people in our target customer group.\nIn terms of the loan financing and execution, MYbank \nused its Tomtit platform and internal credit rating system for \nloan delivery, and partnerships with rural banks to finance \nthe loans. An example was its partnership with Zhongmou \nZhengyin rural bank in 2020, wherein it had extended loans \nto more than 50,000 individual households within two \nmonths, 90% of whom were new customers.\nMore Products\nIn October 2021, MYbank launched a loan scheme for SMEs \nto help with their supply chain financing. To support the loan \nscheme, MYbank launched a completely digital, supply chain \nfinancial system, called the “Goose System”, which combined \ntraditional supply chain finance processes with technolo-\ngies such as large-scale graph computing, multimodal rec-\nognition, blockchain, and deep learning AI to service both \nupstream and downstream partners in the SME industry.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, SMEs were one of the \nworst hit due to their lower capacity to absorb shocks, and \nfaced financing difficulties both on the supply and demand \nside. Within its first year of implementation, the Goose \nsystem was able to sign up over 500 suppliers, including big \nlocal brands like Haier, Mengniu and Want to help the SMEs.\nMYbank referred to traditional supply chain models as the “1 \n1 N” model, and its technological approach to solve the supply \nchain issue of SMEs as the 1 1 N2 solution. The Goose system \ncatered to loan demand and integrated fund management needs \nof SMEs across supply payments, procurement of orders, goods \ncollection, franchising, and salary payments. In terms of execu-\ntion, the supply chain financing scheme was straightforward. \nFor example, if an SME wanted to procure equipment from \nsuppliers but did not have the funds to do so, the Goose system \nwould allow the SME to apply for a MYbank loan to pay off the \nequipment supplier after providing procurement details, and \nthen repay that loan through monthly instalments.\nThe loan scheme helped both the SMEs and suppliers – \nwhile SMEs could now easily fund their business requirements \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Products eligible for such monthly pay-\nout included farming and agricultural equipment, livestock \nmachinery, communications security equipment, commer-\ncial office equipment leasing, transport equipment, Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) equipment, irrigation machinery, solar \nequipment etc., and the plan was to continue extending the \nsupplier base such that SMEs had access to borrowing from \neven more suppliers.\nResponsible Business\nESG\nMYbank’s vision was to bring long term value to all its stake-\nholders using technology as its key driving force. The firm’s \nshort-term goal was to deal with the epidemic that had \nplagued SMEs and the long-term development goal was to \nenable a deeper understanding and grasp of the needs of the \nsociety. Its ESG strategy, focused on environmental, social, \nand governmental issues, formed the backbone of this vision, \nand emphasised on green finance management, with clearly \nset out goals for achieving environmental targets like ‘carbon \npeak’ and ‘carbon neutrality’. A ‘green evaluation system’ was \nlaunched to identify environmentally-friendly SME lenders \nfor green loan discounts based on how they operated their \nbusiness. Such SMEs were also granted additional benefits \nlike a zero balance savings account and preferential interest \nrates for vehicle procurement.\nMYbank also implemented a digital governance system \nwith personal data privacy protection measures, wherein all \ncustomer information were collected through secure techni-\ncal methods using a multi-party trusted service and comput-\ning server. Using such technology-focused, ESG guided solu-\ntions, MYbank had serviced almost 70 million households by \nthe end of 2021, which included 25 million SMEs, 35 million \nfarmers and 10 million small and micro-operators with green \nratings (highly-rated users).\nCSR\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) and the triple bottom \nline of people, planet and profit fared high in MYbank’s \nagenda, and included initiatives to promote women entre-\npreneurship, green lifestyle, inclusive finance, and digi-\ntal enablement.49 The strategic objective was to also help \ndevelop China’s green financial system and green finan-\ncial instruments, promote participation among consumers \nand investors in green finance, and guide small and micro \nenterprises to practice green finance as a means of deliver-\ning on China’s broader green production and consumption \ngoals.50\nBeyond being part of country level strategic goals, MYbank \nalso implemented a series of measures to help small and \nmicro business owners overcome the economic impact of the \npandemic, including waiving or lowering interest rates. It also \npartnered with 100 banks to launch an initiative to support \nSMEs as they resumed operations post pandemic. The initia-\ntive was able to serve over 10 million SMEs and extend loans \ntotalling US$63 billion (RMB 400 billion) in 2020.\n51\nA “zero-payment-day” service was launched in February \n2020, which attracted around 6.5 million rural lenders in one \nmonth and was extended to another four months due to the \nexpansive effect of the pandemic on the rural population.52 \nElaborating on some other CSR initiatives in 2022, Wang \nJian, shared,\nThis year, there were floods in Henan and Shaanxi; \nMYbank launched interest-free coupons and issued \ninterest-free loans to help farmers cope with this difficult \nperiod. Through remote sensing and processing on the \nTomtit platform, we can clearly know which customers \nand which farmers’ fields are flooded and what state they \nare in. Then we can accurately issue interest-free coupons \nto these farmers and provide them with some discounts \nto help tide over difficult times.\nTo help with the flood situation at a national level, MYbank \nalso worked with China Agricultural University to assist the \nNational Disaster Reduction Committee create a model to \nmeasure the flood situation—depicting what each area looked \nlike and how to evaluate the economic loss. Despite taking up \nsuch philanthropic commitments on a regular basis, MYbank \nhad managed to remain profitable in a market that formal \nfinancial institutions had always been apprehensive to enter \ndue to its complexities, risks and lower margins. As of last \nquarter of 2021, MYbank had served more than 45 million \nSMEs and reported a surge in customer growth of almost \n30% year-on-year. Statistically, around 90.8% of these SME \nlenders had paid back their loans on time, which had in turn \nhelped increase their credit levels while continuing to main-\ntain the non-performing loan ratio at low levels.53,54\nMYbank had also launched social welfare programs \nto reduce economic parity. According to the International \nFinance Corporation (IFC), women entrepreneurs in emerg-\ning markets faced a daunting gender finance gap when it \ncame to growing their start-ups, as they continued to face \nunequal access to capital in the traditional banking and \ninvestment environment. MYbank tried to bridge this gender \nbias by employing completely digital approval and delivery of \nloans which were known to be less biased. In addition, the \nbank tried to address the two key challenges faced by women \nentrepreneurs—accessing financing opportunities and lack of \ndigital knowhow, through a ‘3D’ approach—by enabling dig-\nital financing, providing digital skills training and building \ndigital communities. The understanding was that the com-\nbination of these three key components could play a unique \nrole in scaling up women entrepreneur’s equitable and inclu-\nsive development.55\nBy 2020, over 50% of MYbank loan recipients were \nwomen entrepreneurs, and about 80% of them had received \ntheir first-ever loan from the bank. Between 2015 and \n2020, MYbank was able to provide financing to more than  \n8.2 million women-operated SMEs in China, with an average \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The default rate of MYbank loans \nacross the board for all its products, was about 1.5%, which \nwas 60% lower than the industry average, and almost half of \nthe average ratio of 2.99% for SME loans in China.\nMYbank also established a comprehensive digital com-\nmunication community called the “business engine”, which \nwas housed on the Alipay app. The community provided \nan open, safe and interactive place for about 40 million of \nits SMEs who had signed up, including 19 million women \nentrepreneurs to share learning experiences from their entre-\npreneurial journey. This initiative was further upgraded to \nform the “Mulan Community”, catering exclusively to women \nentrepreneurs.56 The Mulan Community provided three  \nservices—a hotline for business advice, a virtual “Mulan \nUniversity” that offered over a hundred financial and tech \ncourses, and an online chatroom for women to exchange \nbusiness ideas. Such a community environment provided a \nfeeling of empowerment to the women entrepreneurs and \nhelped them collaborate with career mentors, tech lead-\ners and friends who shared a similar vision and challenges  \n(refer to Exhibit 6 for further details on MYbank’s initiatives \nto support women entrepreneurship).57\nExhibit 6 Supporting Women Entrepreneurs\nSource: Ant Group Website\nWomen entrepreneurs in Dangshan County in eastern China’s Anhui Province were able to expand their fruit business with loans from MYbank.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The latter could improve the quality and safety of agri-\ncultural products, enhance the brand name of smaller farms, \nand increase operative benefits of agriculture and farming. \nTowards this end, partnerships were formed to bring new \ntechnologies to farmers.\nFor example, in 2020, MYbank’s loan offerings were \npaired with Ant Group’s rural vitalisation technology. Ant \nGroup partnered with Agricultural Bank of China and the \nlocal government of Anhui Province’s Dangshan County to \ncreate a rural vitalisation model called the ‘Dangshan Model’ \nto enable improved credit assessment. Each Dangshan-grown \npear was verifiable with a unique ID generated by blockchain \ntechnology that could trace data on the source of the fruit, its \nplanting history, distribution, and government supervision \ndata, thereby establishing a fully credible and traceable agri-\ncultural production chain. The technology also allowed the \ntracking of the fruit’s sales, delivery, and other related data in \nplatforms like Taobao and Tmall, which in turn could be used \nby MYbank in its credit-assessment. Such solutions backed \nby technology created a robust foundation for the rural credit \nsystem and efficiently solved the dual problem of inclusive \nfinance and sustainable agriculture.58\nIn another project in Inner Mongolia, MYbank’s inclusive \nfinance loan was paired with Ant’s blockchain technology \n(AntChain) to create an efficient system for enabling green \nagriculture. This smart agricultural system used blockchain \nfor traceability and authentication to determine and verify \nthe value of a particular rice field and assign its produce a \ngreen digital ID, called the ‘green-core’ food safety code. The \ninitiative was a pilot experiment to establish how technology \ncould be used to standardise green produce, enable MYbank \nto assess credit needs and apply preferential credit rates for \nfarmers based on such data, and promote green agriculture.\nHowever, sustainable finance initiatives like the ones \nimplemented above, were not new, had been tested unsuccess-\nfully in many countries, and had their fair share of challenges.59 \nFor example, hundreds of dams and agricultural schemes \nset up across Africa by the World Bank had mostly failed to \nreach their intended goals due to problems associated with \npolitical and governmental management frameworks.60\nThe distributed inclusive finance solutions launched by \nMYbank on the other hand provided smallholding farmers \nwith the capital and motivation required to implement more \nclimate-sensitive farming practices, without the bureaucratic \ninfluence of political and management frameworks.61 Ana-\nlysts had forecasted that such technology solutions, usage of \ndigital currencies, and increasing consumer interest in trans-\nparent carbon-offsets could establish an efficient pathway for \nnew forms of liquidity pools62 to counter financial risks from \nsmall-scale farmers exploring sustainable, eco-friendly agri-\ncultural techniques.63\nFive Year Plan, Digital Yuan,  \nand Moving Forward\nIn June 2020, MYbank had laid down its five-year plans \nfor expansion; the objective was to reach more SMEs \nacross China by working with partners across multiple \nsectors and embedding its services seamlessly into new \nuse cases. To enable further growth, MYbank tried to \nestablish new partnerships, using emerging technolo-\ngies to build new, more efficient business solutions, and \nspread its user net wider.\nTowards this end, the firm had collaborated with Chi-\nnese logistics platform Log56.com (with 70,000 registered \ncorporate users), leveraging on Ant Group’s blockchain tech-\nnology, to extend micro loans to 200,000 truck drivers and \nmicro logistics business owners. The blockchain technology \naided credit risk assessment with reliable, tamper-proof logis-\ntics information such as order and execution numbers. In \nanother project, MYbank teamed up with Chinese food man-\nufacturing company Jinmailang Food to extend loans to over \n5,000 distributors across its supply chain, which helped the \ndistributors cope with the economic impact of the pandemic \nby using short-term loans to restock their supplies. \nFast forwarding to April 2022, as China’s rural economy \nstarted to slowly recuperate after the pandemic, MYbank’s \nrole as an enabler of rural entrepreneurship became even \nmore critical, amidst rising regulatory control to support \nstricter oversight on data sources and data use.64 However, \ncompetition in the online banking market was increasing, \nand players like WeBank had also encroached into the SME \nmarket space, making it more difficult for MYbank to expand \nits profits based just on scale (refer to Exhibit 7 for compari-\nson of MYbank and WeBank).\nA separate consideration was regarding digital curren-\ncies. In January 2022, China had launched its pilot digital \nyuan, also referred to as the e-CNY, which had been high-\nlighted by international and national institutions as a tool to \npromote an inclusive digital economy. Such currencies were \npredicted to promote financial inclusion and contribute to \nthe countries’ efforts towards creating a new financial system \nthat centred around the needs of the people. As the financial \necosystem became increasingly digital, people who did not \nhave bank accounts could be left further behind; and digital \ncurrencies could help avoid this gap by establishing a more \ninclusive digital payment ecosystem and creating financial \ndata identities.65\nMYbank had been selected as one of the distributors \nof e-CNY, which required residents in China to link their \ne-CNY services to a bank account. The e-CNY was expected \nto have a symbiotic relationship with payment platforms like \nAlipay and WeChat Pay and provide benefits to online pay-\nment platforms by creating more visibility and generating \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Tom Gores, the billionaire founder of pri-\nvate-equity firm Platinum Equity (Platinum), was facing crit-\nicism from activists over one of the investments in the firm’s \n$23 billion portfolio, Aventiv Technologies (Aventiv).1 Like \nmost private-equity firms, Platinum was used to buying com-\npanies, adding operational expertise to improve company \nperformance, and then divesting the company in three to five \nyears for a nice profit. The formula had worked very well in \nmany industries Platinum invested in including chemicals, \ncommunications, logistics, health care, automotive, industrial \nproducts, and business services. But Aventiv, acquired for \n$1.5 billion in 2017, when the company was named Securus \nTechnologies (Securus), was part of a multibillion-dollar \nindustry that served the over two million inmates in the US \nprison system. As such, the company drew attention not only \nfor its business performance but also for its business practices \nat the nexus of broad national debate about social justice, \ncriminal justice, race, and mass incarceration in America. \nEarly on, Platinum discovered that this made the Securus \ninvestment different. Gores said later, “I don’t think we really \nhad a good sense of the social issues underneath of it all.”\nThe social issues around prison telecommunication cen-\ntered primarily on the high rates charged to inmate consum-\ners and their families and friends. For 20 years, the US prison \nindustry had been in a growth market from which the tele-\ncom companies serving the industry had benefited greatly. \nCompanies like Aventiv’s subsidiary, Securus, contracted \nwith the operators of federal, state, and local corrections facil-\nities (the customer) for the right to offer telephone and other \ncommunications services to inmates and their friends and \nfamilies (the consumer). Unlike traditional phone services \npeople used every day on the outside, deploying telecommu-\nnications in a correctional environment had to account for \na wide range of safety, security, legal, and operational con-\nsiderations that added cost and complexity. Those services \nwere paid for by the inmate and family consumers, not by \nthe facility customers. In fact, in many cases, an additional \ncharge was tacked onto the inmate consumers’ bills and paid \nto the agency customers in the form of a “site commission” \nthat was, in effect, a tax that generated revenue for the prison \nor jail operator. Those prison and jail operators valued not \nonly the telecommunications platform and the service it pro-\nvided to inmates and their families, but also the commissions \nthey received—which helped fund their budgets. However, \nthe consumers wanted the highest degree of access at the \nlowest possible price. That created a friction in balancing the \ndemands of the agency customers and the inmate consumers. \nSecurus Executive Randy Phillips said, “Because some of our \nconsumer wants and the facility wants are sometimes dia-\nmetrically opposed to each other, we’re in the middle of it…\nyou need to serve the facility customers in order to be able to \nserve the consumers…and that puts us in a very difficult spot \nat times to balance out all the parties’ needs.”\nAfter Platinum bought the business, it pledged to make \nexisting telecommunications products more affordable and \naccessible. And strategically, it planned to expand the busi-\nness beyond telecommunications and into tablet and related \ntechnology that would offer education, entertainment, job \ntraining, and post-incarceration products and services that \nwould benefit inmates on the inside and help reduce recidi-\nvism once they were released. A new corporate parent, Aven-\ntiv, was formed to drive this technology transformation. The \ntransformation program represented a significant decision by \nPlatinum to lean into the issues facing the company and the \nindustry, rather than run away from them.\n“We could sell and get out,” said Gores, who owned the \nDetroit Pistons in addition to leading Platinum and its 50-plus \noperating companies. “But some other person may just get in \nand focus on the business aspects at the expense of the social \naspects. They’re not going to make the necessary change. Sell-\ning would have been a lot easier for us than taking the lumps \nthat go along with really transforming a company and an \nindustry, but I think this investment provides a really unique \nopportunity to do something that I think is revolutionary.”\nThe first step was installing a new CEO, Dave Abel, with \na mandate to launch broad and deep reforms. Then, in short \nsuccession, an outspoken advocacy group focused on broad \ncorrections reform targeted Gores and Platinum for a pres-\nsure campaign, and then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. That \nonly accelerated the company’s rethinking of past industry \npractices. Gores knew that Aventiv and the industry were at \na crossroads. The battering they were taking in the press only \nmade change feel more urgent. And while it was only about \n1% of Platinum’s portfolio, Gores commented that, “It will \nbe maybe one of the most important companies I ever buy.” \nChange was coming.

Stricter sentencing \nlaws emanating from the Sentencing Reform Acts of 1984, \nalong with later “tough on crime” legislation—like the 1994 \n“Three Strikes Law” in California, which required long man-\ndatory sentences for repeat offenders, and the 1994 Violent \nCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act—led to a massive \nand sustained uptick in US incarcerations. In 1980, less than \n320,000 people were serving time in state and federal pris-\nons, a number which grew to 1.47 million by 2003.2 By 2009, \nthis number had peaked at 1.61 million.3 By adding prisoners \nin local jails to the figure, the total number of people incar-\ncerated rose to a high of 2.3 million in 2008, representing \na peak incarceration rate per capita of about 1,000 inmates \nper 100,000 adults.4 By 2021, the United States (with less than \n5% of the world’s population) imprisoned nearly 20% of the \nworld’s incarcerated,5 yielding a higher rate per capita (639) \nthan any other nation (Exhibit 1).\nThe incarceration rate disproportionately affected the \nAfrican American community. By 2003, African Ameri-\ncan men were more than five times more likely than white \nmen and three times more likely than Hispanic men to be \nserving time.6 While this rate began to decline thereafter,7 \nby 2019, African Americans were still more than three times \nmore likely to be incarcerated than white people (Exhibit 2). \nAs prison populations grew, spending surged to create new \nprisons, hire new corrections staff, and supply the prison \necosystem with myriad services. This effectively created an \neconomic stimulus and jobs programs in many communities. \nBetween 1980 and 2000, more than $7 billion per year was \nspent on the construction of new prisons.8 State expenditures \non corrections grew from an annual rate of $6.7 billion in \n1985 to $60.9 billion by 2018 (Exhibit 3).\nDeregulation Shapes the US \nCorrectional Communications Market\nOne of the critical services benefiting from this rise in pris-\non-related spending was the telecommunications industry, \nwhich began to deregulate from AT&T’s effective monop-\noly control in 1984. The breakup resulting from deregu-\nlation meant that AT&T would provide long-distance ser-\nvices while new independent “baby bell” regional operating \ncompanies would provide local telecom services. Until 1984, \nthe inmate telephone market was controlled exclusively by \nExhibit I  Countries with the Largest Number of Prisoners per 100,000 Residents as of May 2021\nData source: “Countries with the Largest Number of Prisoners per 100,000 of the National Population, as of May 2021,” Statista, May 2021, https://www.statista.com/statistics/300986 \n/incarceration-rates-in-oecd-countries/ (accessed Sept. 16, 2021).\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\nUnited States\nEl Salvador\nTurkmenistan\nPalau\nRwanda\nCuba\nMaldives\nVirgin Islands (UK)\nThailand\nBahamas\nPanama\nGrenada\nGuam (US)\nVirgin Islands (US)\nSt. Kitts and Nevis\nCosta Rica\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines\nAnguilla (UK)\nBrazil\nBelarus\nAmerican Samoa (US)\nUruguay\nTurkey\nNicaragua\nRussian Federation\nSeychelles\nNorthern Mariana Islands (US)\nCayman Islands (UK)\nBelize\nAntigua and Barbuda\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Thereafter, the service was offered by a mishmash of \nbaby bells such as MCI, and new market entrants like Pay-Tel \nCommunications and Global Tel*Link (GTL).\nWith a raft of communications firms now competing for \nlucrative contracts (usually between three and five years in \nlength), county, state, and federal decision-makers began to \nmonetize their position. At the time, pay phone providers \nrented space in high-traffic areas by paying a share of the rev-\nenue to the space’s owner (for a pay phone in McDonald’s, \nrevenue would be split between franchisee and phone oper-\nator, or if a phone was on a city street corner, revenue would \nbe shared with the city). As a result, the corrections customer \nbegan to require commissions (as a percentage of revenue) or \n“kickbacks” in order to sign deals. Some facilities started pri-\noritizing these kickbacks over low rates or technology options \nwhen choosing a phone provider.9 With budget demands \nrising, many sheriffs and jail officials welcomed the new \nsource of revenue, which was passed along in higher per-min-\nute costs to the inmate or their family and friends. Such com-\nmissions ranged from 10% to 55% of gross revenues and by \n1995, were required by 90% of correctional systems nation-\nwide.10 Further deregulation in the Telecommunications Act \nof 1996 led to an acceleration of market entrants competing \nfor communications contracts with correctional facilities.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

A recent 2021 RFP stated \nthe following (Table 1).\nA scoresheet was compiled, often with the help of consul-\ntants, rating each of the bidders in the various categories to \nselect a winning bid (Exhibit 4).\nTo some, it made sense that the inmate (and their family \nand friends) should bear this additional expense rather than \nthe taxpayer (who hadn’t committed a crime), but the end \nrate paid by the inmate soon began to grow rapidly. By the \nmid-1990s, the price of a single 15-minute in-state call had \ntopped $20 in some places, and out-of-state fees spiked as \nhigh as $2 per minute.11 This stood out in contrast to the \noverall telecommunications industry, where consumer rates \navailable outside of facilities plummeted due to deregulation \nand competition. Over time, the commissions grew with \neach new contract and encompassed third-party-services \npayments, signing bonuses, and equipment and technology \ngrants. By 2000, the state of New York charged a national \nhigh of 60% and earned more than $20 million per year from \nprison phone revenue (a figure matched by California and \nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons).12\nThroughout the 1990s the market for inmate commu-\nnications companies remained fragmented, but through a \nseries of acquisitions, it came to be dominated by two car-\nriers operating on lines leased from local exchange carriers: \nGTL and Securus. By 2021, GTL served 2,400 facilities in \nall 50 states; Washington, DC; and Puerto Rico (controlling \n45% of the market), and Securus served about 2,000 facil-\nities serving nearly one  million incarcerated individu-\nals (with 40% of the market). Typically, contracts ran for \nthree years with two one-year renewals that could make the \ncontract five years. Andrew Becker, a long-term employee \nresponsible for financial analysis, estimated that the con-\ntract incumbent was about 20% more likely to retain the \ncontract during the next bidding process, “because change \nis painful, right?” Fraudulent or criminal events originat-\ning from prison and jail phone calls along with technology \ninnovations began to increase the need and ability for new \ntechnology that allowed corrections workers, police inves-\ntigators, and prosecutors access to recordings on demand, \nwhich could be used by investigators across jurisdictions as \na crime-solving tool.13 By 2021, the prison telecom industry \nwas worth $1.2 billion,14 not including other revenues for \nparticipants like tablet applications and sales, money trans-\nfer, and monitoring.\nPrivate Equity Discovers a Growth \nIndustry\nThe growth in inmates and prison facilities meant that an \nincreasing amount of dollars from state and federal budgets \nwere devoted to the prison ecosystem. The cottage industry \nof companies servicing the telecommunications needs of this \ngrowth industry began to gain attention. Private-equity inves-\ntors were quick to see value in companies like Securus that \nserved the prison population. Securus had everything that \nprivate-equity investors valued—high margins, long-term \nrecurring contracts, and growing cash flow. In 2011, invest-\nment firm Castle Harlan bought Securus from H.I.G. Capital, \na private-equity firm based in Miami. At the time, Securus \nserved 2,200 facilities across 44 states; Washington, DC; and \nCanada.15 In 2013, Securus was acquired by ABRY Partners \nfor $640 million (HarbourVest Partners and Mesirow Finan-\ncial also participated).16\nIn 2017, Beverly Hills–based private-equity firm Platinum \nbecame interested in Securus. GTL and IC Solutions (ICS) \nwere Securus’s main competitors. GTL and Securus offered \nthe two most robust offerings in the market, while ICS was \nmore of a pure telephone company competing primarily in \ncounty and municipal markets. While GTL was bigger on \nthe phone side, Securus had a lead in the tablet business \nand potentially more room to grow. Platinum’s thesis was \nexplained by one of the firm’s partners, Mark Barnhill: “We \nlook for broken companies. Undermanaged, underperform-\ning. We buy them at a discount to market. We then fix what’s \nTable 1 2021 communications RFP.\n9.2 Proposals will be reviewed by an Evaluation Committee and scored on the following criteria:\n0–10 points Technical Specifications, System, Installation, & Operational Requirements\n10\n0–20 points Merits of the Proposal: clarity and directness of responses\n20\n0–20 points References, company background, qualifications, and stability\n20\n0–20 points Service and support capabilities\n20\n0–10 points Calling rates to be charged\n10\n0–20 points Commission and Call Accountability\n20\n100\nSource: Aventiv Technologies; used with permission.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The opportunity at \nSecurus started with an operations transformation centered \non moving from inmate telephony to a broader technology \nplatform with more expansive products and services. But we \nalso saw the importance of being change agents driving a \nlarger industry transformation with respect to criminal justice \nand social-justice reform.” Securus was acquired by Platinum \nthrough a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout in November 2017. \nTerm loans worth over $1.1 billion along with a $150 million \nrevolving credit line were provided by BNP Paribas, Jeffries \nFinance, Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, \nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank.17\nBecker pointed to the logical reason private equity liked \nthe sector: “The only reason private equity would buy any-\nbody is to make money, would they not? To have a long-\nterm investment portfolio and grow the business somehow.” \nPlatinum’s initial focus was on the operational transforma-\ntion, but social-justice issues very quickly rose in prominence \nbecause much had changed in society. The global pandemic \ncreated both health concerns and isolation for inmates; \nsocial protests emanating from the death of George Floyd \nin 2020 magnified attention to racial, social, and economic \njustice issues in America; and the US election of the Biden \nadministration brought a more progressive national legisla-\ntive agenda. Tensions also flared between law enforcement \nand the communities it served. With respect to incarceration, \nthe line was blurred between providing necessary products \nand services to prisons and jails and unnecessarily “profi-\nteering” from that captive customer base. Aventiv, Securus, \nPlatinum, and Gores all felt pressure to defend themselves \nas investors and change agents rather than profiteers, and \nGores would later admit that he underestimated the “head-\nline risk” and backlash from activists that his ownership of \nSecurus would bring.18 Critics were demanding lower phone \nprices for inmates, particularly at a time when the world was \nrecovering from a pandemic. But because of the competi-\ntive nature of the industry, the multijurisdictional contracts \nwith commissions, and Securus’s cultural legacy, change was \nunlikely to be easy.\nHistory: Tele-Matic Becomes Securus \nBecomes Aventiv Technologies19\nThe predecessor company to Securus, T-Netix, Inc. (T-Netix), \nwas founded in 1986 under the name Tele-Matic Corporation. \nA series of business combinations through the 1990s culmi-\nnated in the merger of two correctional industry giants in \n2004: H.I.G. Capital–owned Evercom with T-Netix, forming \nSecurus. Randy Phillips, who joined the company in 2008, \nexplained that the implications of traditional collect calling \noffered to consumers of jail and prison phone calls and billed \nthrough local exchange carriers increased bad debt expense \nacross many providers, threatening the financial health of the \nindustry. At the time, the business worked like this: Inmates \nmade collect calls home to family. The family would accept \nthe charge, but not have to pay until later. Securus and other \nproviders would bill telecom carriers for each completed \ncall. Securus would then pay contractual commissions to the \ncorrections facility. It would take several months to recon-\ncile whether the family would pay for the collect calls to the \ntelecom carrier, and an increasing number did not pay. This \nresulted in bad debt that was passed on to Securus (which \nwas not paid, but still had to pay the corrections facility). \n“There were a number of competitors that failed to under-\nstand these operational complexities and would ultimately \nshut down,” said Phillips.\nIn 2008, Rick Smith, a former telecom executive from \nEschelon Telecom in Minnesota, joined the company as \nCEO, a position he would hold until the end of 2017. Phillips \nexplained that Smith introduced a “disciplined financial, \nsales, and operational mindset,” while at the same time the \nindustry was changing, and society began to rapidly scale \nthe use of cell phones. Unlike local exchange carrier billing, \ncell phone providers did not bill collect calls on behalf of jail \nor prison telecom providers. Phillips explained, “As society \nincreased adoption of cell phones, it meant prison and jail \ntelecom providers would need to migrate to a prepaid model. \nThis meant friends and family members would need to open \nand fund a prepaid calling account before they could accept \ncall charges from someone in jail or prison.” Soon, though, \nanother problem arose. Phillips explained, “Under previous/\ntraditional collect calling methods, consumers accepting call \ncharges were simply deferring payment until they received \ntheir home bill. Under evolving cell phone adoption, the pre-\npaid function would add the complexity of informing con-\nsumers who was calling, and why and how to create and set \nup an account to accept calls.”\nTo tackle these new consumer-facing issues, Securus \nbegan to test a number of “first call connect” strategies, such \nas 20-second free calls. The North Star of the company in \nthose days was increasing call volume by reducing barriers to \nentry in order to maximize profitability. In order to facilitate \nefficient account creation and take online payments, Securus \ncreated a number of website capabilities—something histori-\ncally not needed under traditional collect calling. That added \nan alternative to an 800 number or the option for friends and \nfamily to physically go to Western Union and pay the asso-\nciated fees. Phillips explained that to improve call comple-\ntions, “We had to be consumer friendly—we had to make our \nservices easy to use.” Around 2010, additional development \nenabled inmates access to their own telecom debit account. \nIf they transferred money to these debit accounts, it allowed \nthem to make and pay for calls to anyone (not just to friends \nand family that had prepaid) unless restricted by the facility. \nCosts continued to be high to the consumer, though, partly \ndue to legacy telecom charges and dominant carrier rates, \nwhich were prevalent throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and \npartly due to an attempt to recover earlier bad debt losses \nfrom collect calls. In some cases, carriers in certain regions \ncharged scaled-fee structures that Securus passed on in \nthe form of $2.50 surcharges for calls, 35 cents for the first \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Interstate \ncalls could be even higher, with some costing a $3.95 sur-\ncharge and 95 cents per minute. The company’s hope was to \ndecrease rates in time and make up for the revenue loss by \nincreasing call volume.\nFollowing the 2011 sale of Securus to Castle Harlan, the \ncompany went on a buying spree to consolidate its market \nposition and build out its services for the changing market. \nIn 2012, Securus bought DirectHit Systems (provider of \na data-analysis tool for law enforcement and corrections \nclients) and bought Primonics (video provider to the cor-\nrections industry). In 2013, Securus bought Satellite Track-\ning of People, since renamed Securus Monitoring (which \nmade GPS ankle monitors). In 2014, the company acquired \nJLG Technologies (provider of voice-biometric analysis and \ninvestigative tools) and bought Telerus, (an automated inter-\nactive voice-response system). In 2015, Securus tacked on \nfour more acquisitions: CellBlox (a system to limit use of \ncontraband wireless devices in prisons), JPay (which offered \nmoney transfer, a tablet program, and other financial services \nfor inmates and family), Guarded Exchange (which provided \nforensic services for recovered digital devices), and Cara \nClinicals (a service for electronic medical records and health \ncards). 2015 was also the year a security breach—a hack of \ncall records—occurred in a company just before Securus \nacquired it.20 Abel explained, “As early as my interview pro-\ncess with Platinum, I highlighted the need for every company \nto significantly upgrade cybersecurity protections, and espe-\ncially a company with as much data under its care as Aventiv. \nOur consumers and customers must trust our stewardship \nof critical information, and the threats were clearly getting \nmuch worse across all industries. My very first hire upon \narrival was a new chief information security officer (CISO). \nShe has significantly improved our protection and faces an \never-evolving and maturing threat.”\nJPay was another price-inflation issue. The company pri-\nmarily made money as a payment platform, facilitating the \ntransfer of money from consumer to inmate by online pay-\nment, phone call, cash deposit at any MoneyGram agent loca-\ntion (including Walmart and CVS), or through a mobile app. \nThe charges varied by state and facility, but in some instances, \nindividuals could pay fees of more than 30% per transfer. \nRates to send money to inmates in Virginia at the Appala-\nchian Men’s Detention Center, for example, cost $2.95 for the \nfirst $20 transferred, $5.95 for a transfer of between $20.01 \nand $100.00, $7.95 for a transfer of between $100.01  and \n$200.00, and $10.95 for a transfer of between $200.01 and \n$300.00. One inmate said, “The company charges us egre-\ngious fees to put money into our prepaid phone accounts: My \nbrother refills mine for me, and gets charged several dollars \nfor every $50 he puts in—the maximum he can transfer in a \nsingle transaction.”21\nBy 2021, the company had regional offices in Carrollton, \nTexas; Houston, Texas; and Miramar, Florida; with additional \nteams in Massachusetts; Missouri; and Montreal, Canada; \nand employed approximately 1,800  people. The corporate \nculture during those years seemed largely focused on profit, \ngrowth, and serving the needs of the facilities customer, with \nless regard for the needs of the consumer, including inmates \nand their friends and family. Operations Manager Kelly \nBrooks, who joined Securus in 2016 in a customer-service \nrole, explained, “In the old management, facility was the \nprime customer.” Nicole Sullivan, who joined the company \nabout six months before Platinum acquired it, commented \nthat, “I get that it’s business, I’ve been in business my entire \nlife, but it felt a little predatory to me…We had a market that \nreally couldn’t go anywhere, with competitors who were run-\nning their business the same way we were. And so, we kind \nof put people in a position where they didn’t have choices, \nand the choices they did have are probably not something \nyou and I would be really excited about.” That included high \nprices and quality that “wasn’t as high as it should have been.” \nMarci Thompson, a product leader, commented, “Histori-\ncally, we’ve been about making our customer happy, which \nis the facilities, department of corrections, the sheriff. And \nso, when you’re completely focused on that and only that, \nyou make different decisions than when you are focused on \nboth—our friends and family and our incarcerated versus our \ncustomer, which is the contract owner.”\nFollowing the 2017 acquisition of Securus by Platinum, \nthe company attempted to acquire ICSolutions, the industry’s \nthird-largest company, in 2018. After reviewing the transac-\ntion, though, the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division \nand the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) sig-\nnaled they would likely block the deal. In a press release,22 \nFCC chair Ajit Pai wrote, “Based on a record of nearly 1 mil-\nlion documents comprised of 7.7 million pages of informa-\ntion submitted by the applicants, as well as arguments and \nevidence submitted by criminal justice advocates, consumer \ngroups, and other commenters, FCC staff concluded that this \ndeal posed significant competitive concerns and would not \nbe in the public interest.” The company decided to abandon \nthe deal that would have further strengthened the duopoly \nwith GTL.\nPlatinum’s investment thesis envisioned moving Securus \naway from being a pure telecommunications services pro-\nvider, and toward a more diversified technology offering \nbased on tablet technology and a broader array of enter-\ntainment, education, job training, and post-incarceration \nproducts and services. In 2019, the company announced a \ncorporate reorganization reflecting that vision and announc-\ning a new corporate parent (Aventiv) focused on research, \ndevelopment, and innovation; and three underlying busi-\nness lines (Securus, JPay, and AllPaid). Together, these busi-\nnesses would focus on product-line expansions including \nnext-generation tablets, new financial-management tools, \nand new government payment platforms.23\nPlatinum Equity Installs Abel as CEO\nIn 2019, Platinum unveiled a reorganization of Securus. \nThe goal was to continue to transform the company from \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

At the time, CEO Bob Pick-\nens said, “We are working to ensure that our core commu-\nnications services are more affordable, more responsive and \nattuned to the needs of all of our customers, including correc-\ntions agencies, incarcerated individuals, families, and friends. \nAt the same time, we are developing innovative technology \nproducts and services that will better serve both customers \nand consumers and have broader application beyond the cor-\nrections marketplace.”25 Gores, however, was not happy with \nthe pace of things under Pickens. Reflecting back, he noted, \n“Our old management team just wasn’t listening.”\nIn April 2019, Platinum recruited Abel to develop an \naccelerated business-transformation program for Securus. \nAs an executive at IBM and a partner at Pricewaterhouse-\nCoopers, Abel was responsible for turning around and grow-\ning service and software businesses, gaining particular expe-\nrience working with government contractors throughout his \ncareer. On January 13, 2020, Abel was named president and \nCEO of Aventiv. At the time, Bryan Kelln from Platinum \ncommented, “Dave is an innovative leader who we recruited \nin April to develop and accelerate an ambitious business \ntransformation program for Securus.”26 A key part of the \ntransformation was becoming more consumer focused. \nWhen Abel was hired, he said, “We have the opportunity—\nand the responsibility—to address the financial and social \nneeds of the communities we serve, making our services \nmore affordable and accessible while continuing to innovate \nand help our government partners keep those communities \nsafe and secure.”27\nOne of the first surprising things Abel discovered when \nhe became CEO was that Aventiv was facing a liquidity crisis. \n“We had such a high debt ratio and we had constrained cash \nflow and a lot of investments in infrastructure, technology, \net cetera—and we were dangerously close to running out of \ncash, which means you’re going to run out of blood in the \nbody.” The business had enjoyed steady growth until 2019, \nwhen profitability declined. Cash flow had been spent ineffi-\nciently, in Abel’s opinion. Money was spent servicing existing \ncontracts rather than in pursuit of new ones. There was also \nhigh turnover in call centers and the poor integration of sev-\neral acquisitions. “The turn came really quickly. Part of that \ncame from COVID,” Abel said. There was less travel because \npeople were locked down, so expenses decreased. Meanwhile, \nincarcerated individuals wanted to use more telecommunica-\ntions to check on their loved ones, so volumes surged. Much \nof that increased demand was met by a program the company \nenacted that would ultimately provide 41.5 million free phone \ncalls, totaling over 341.5 million free minutes.\nWhen Abel took the helm, his top priority was around \nchanging the company’s culture. That required setting a new \nagenda and clarifying the mission. It also meant changing \nthe leadership team. Within the first 18 months, Abel and \nPlatinum had replaced 10 of the 14 people on the leadership \nteam. Abel also pushed to decentralize the decision-making \nto be as close to customers and consumers as possible. “Cre-\nating a different purpose for the company is job number 1,” \nsaid Abel. “The purpose of this company when I joined was \nto be bought and sold…but by itself that is not a purpose; it’s \nan outcome or even a byproduct.” Abel believed the num-\nber-one challenge for the company was to “balance out the \ncreation of value in the organization equally, fairly among \nconsumers, customers, shareholders, and employees.” What \nabout advocates, legislators, and regulators? Abel didn’t think \nthey were primary stakeholders in the traditional sense. He \nviewed them as key influencers worthy of engagement, but \nclearly noted that “we are not here to create value for them.” \nStill, Abel believed that had the industry appropriately bal-\nanced value creation for its true stakeholders in the past, “you \nwould not need lawmakers or regulators to step in and try to \ndo the job.”\nAbel’s second priority was “accessibility, affordability, and \nthe quality of the products that we deliver.” The phones and \ntablets had to be reliable, and the pricing had to come down \nso that the services were accessible. The third priority was \nresearch and development. “I fully expect tablets to replace \nphones.” Innovation would continue to be important going \nforward to help connect people. That required research, \ninnovation, and capital. In the press release around Abel’s \nhiring, he previewed the main initiatives of the transforma-\ntion: accessibility and affordability, transparency and educa-\ntion, re-entry and recidivism, listening and responsiveness, \nand technology and innovation (Exhibit 5).\nPrimary telecommunications (the traditional prison \nphones on walls) was the largest part of the company’s busi-\nness, though it was shrinking. With the average daily prison \npopulation unlikely to expand, and a resource-limited con-\nsumer, different approaches would be necessary to grow the \nbusiness. In addition to the consumer base, margins were \nshrinking—mostly because of continued price pressures, \nbut also because of cost-side inflation. The fastest-growing \npart of the company’s business was media, messaging, \nand education—core tablet content. Abel explained that \nits growth rate was “60%, 70%, 80% quarter over quarter,” \nshowing the demand in the market for such services. Tab-\nlets were introduced to the prison market as early as 2010, \ninitially as MP3 players. One corrections officer commented \non the impact tablets had at his prison: “Suicide attempts and \nsuicide ideations are down by at least 50%. If we can have \na positive impact on recidivism rates and it makes it safer \nfor the inmates and my officers, it’s a win-win scenario.”28 \nThe tablet business was improving, despite the fact that the \noverall prison population had declined since the start of the \npandemic—due mostly to COVID-related early releases. \nThis was because a larger percentage of inmates were using \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The company sought \nto balance the surge in demand by offering free credits for \ncommunications services such as e-messages, video chats, \nand phone calls.29\nGTL and Aventiv were both exploring different models \nfor getting the tablets to prisoners, who valued the ability \nto video-call friends and family on the outside. Charging \ninmates up front for the tablets didn’t make economic sense \nfor jails wherein individuals were held for only a month or \ntwo. For prisons, where stays were much longer, ownership \nof tablets could reduce the likelihood that tablets would be \nbroken, which as of 2021 stood at 10% per year.\nThere was also the issue of the tablet programming. \nAventiv, in an effort to sell music on tablets and media play-\ners, cut deals with publishing companies in the music, movie, \nvideo game, and educational industry to offer many options. \nInmates seeking to better themselves would have access to \ncollege courses and other educational material. But they also \nhad the ability to play video games and fill their time with \nmore mindless entertainment options—for a cost, of course. \nSome figured the average prisoner would play games and \nmusic 8 to 10 hours a day, just like anyone in America, rather \nthan work on programs that helped their rehabilitation.30 \nSome were concerned about the possibility that tablets would \nreplace in-person visits, which were thought to be better \nfor lowering recidivism. Indeed, before Platinum bought \nthe company, Securus had signed several contracts directly \nincentivizing prisons to restrict in-person visiting hours in \norder to drive more people to using the tablet product. “We’ve \nrooted that out of the system,” said Barnhill. When the pan-\ndemic arrived, though, in-person meetings were not allowed, \nand inmates were thankful for the technology.\nAbel was acutely aware of criticism in the industry and \nhad plans to address it. “Our products are too expensive. \nThe price of our products needs to be reduced. Period.” \n(Exhibit 6.) Prices had come down by more than 30% under \nExhibit 5 Dave Abel’s 2020 Plan for Aventiv Technologies\n1. Accessibility and Affordability\n \n●\nWhile Securus has reduced the average cost of calls by 30% over the past 3 years, not all consumers felt the same relief. The company \npledges to work with all our institutional customers to broaden rate relief for more consumers by targeting the elimination of legacy \noutlier rates and reinvesting in the development innovations and tools to further reduce costs.\n \n●\nIn 2019 Securus became the only service provider to announce full neutrality on the presence of site commissions and the provision of \nproducts regardless of the funding source and model determined by each locality. The organization will build on that in 2020 by working \nwith all interested institutional customers on implementing these lower-cost-to-consumer alternatives.\n \n●\nSecurus will reduce the application of third-party funding fees by investing in technology solutions where possible -- and negotiating \nlower rates where outside vendors are still required -- to provide savings to consumers of at least 35% on these fees by year end.\n2. Transparency\n \n●\nSecurus will provide a clear and simple recitation of call rates to both customers and consumers, ensuring that those call rates are always \navailable online and at the time of each call before they are accepted.\n \n●\nThe Company will commission an annual report of inmate calling costs, produced and published by an independent third party, including \na breakdown of what is being charged beyond the specific cost of the call (for example, additional costs necessary for the provision of \nsafety protocols and service).\n \n●\nSecurus will publish by the middle of this year an industry-leading report detailing a terms-of-use policy for its products, and memorializ-\ning comprehensive data privacy standards.\n3. Education, Reentry and Recidivism\n \n●\nSecurus will immediately sign the Society for Human Resource Management Getting Talent Back to Work Pledge.\n \n●\nThe Company will contribute at least $3 million in 2020 to efforts focused on reducing recidivism rates and improving reentry rates, \nincluding support for The Securus Foundation to connect justice agencies more closely to their communities utilizing technology.\n \n●\nThe Company will create a post-incarceration scholarship program to facilitate the completion of post-secondary degrees begun under \nSecurus’ existing educational product and service opportunities. \n4. Listening and Responsiveness \n \n●\nMr. Abel and other company executives will meet each quarter with families and individuals personally impacted by incarceration to hear \ntheir recommendations and address their concerns about the company’s products and services.\n \n●\nCompany leaders will also meet with corrections facility customers, correctional trade associations and advocates of alternative incarcera-\ntion approaches to hear their recommendations and hear their concerns.\n5. Technology and Innovation\n \n●\nSecurus pledges to invest at least $40 million this year in facility communication infrastructure for the advancement of public safety and \ncommunity needs. \n \n●\nThe Company will devote at least $30 million to fund innovations in the development of secure products to take on the ever-evolving \nchallenges facing correctional agencies in the new decade.\nSource: Aventiv Technologies; used with permission.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The average price per minute of a \nSecurus phone call dropped below $0.15, inclusive of all fees \nand commissions—or less than $2.25 for a 15-minute call. \nThe company had committed to an additional 15% reduc-\ntion over the next three years. It was working to further cut \ncosts by renegotiating contracts with hundreds of customers \nand providing new options that could help those customers \nreduce or eliminate their commissions. Abel also pointed to \na 2019 analysis the company had commissioned by consul-\ntant FTI,31 which showed that “cost is driven almost entirely \nin our business outside of commission by size and loca-\ntion of facility.” Smaller and more rural facilities were more \nexpensive because there were fewer consumers and thus less \nvolume. But there was no getting around commissions. “Our \nsingle highest cost in the business continues to be commis-\nsions,” Abel said. How did the company manage that? First, \nAbel emphasized that it would not compete by acting as a \n“shield for obtaining commissions,” as it had in the past. The \nsecond principle was to increase transparency. While some \ncustomers didn’t care that their consumers were charged and \nthat the public knew about it, others did. This could slowly \nbring change to the industry. Third, the company wanted to \nhelp facilitate a broader discussion with regulators and local \ndecision-makers about who should bear the cost burden. \nThe commission issue didn’t seem to be going away, mostly \nbecause “constraints in the budgets are getting worse, not \nbetter.”\nCriminal-Justice Advocates Push Back\nSince the late 1990s, advocates have pushed back against the \nhigh price of inmate communications. Inmate jobs in prisons \nonly paid a few cents per hour, so much of the burden to pay \nfor telecom services fell on families and friends. Advocates \npointed out that low-income families often faced hard finan-\ncial tradeoffs—telephone services often approached rent as \nthe largest monthly bill.32 Some reported foregoing medical \noperations or prescription drugs to meet payments on phone \nbills.33 If instead, family and friends chose to cut off communi-\ncations with the inmate to save money, many studies showed \nthat a lack of connection to the community increased the \nlikelihood that the criminal would reoffend when released.34 \nAdditional societal costs could be borne by the children of \nthe incarcerated if communications were cut off.\nOver time, excessive prison profiteering has been fought \nin the court of public opinion and through lawsuits.35 The \nsuccess of such efforts has been mixed. In 2002, Califor-\nnia agreed to a reduction in state commissions to reduce \ninmate calling costs by as much as 25%. In 2013, the FCC \nput a cap of 21 cents per minute on interstate calls from both \njails and prison. But for the 90% of calls that were in-state, \ncosts remained too high—as much as $30 for a 15-minute \ncall, in some states.36 GTL had also been involved in multiple \nclass-action lawsuits across the country, which include alle-\ngations of charging “unnecessary and unconscionable” rates \nto inmates and their families. In Mississippi, GTL settled a \ncase—which alleged that the company bribed corrections \nofficials—for $2.5 million, but admitted no wrongdoing in \nthe settlement, and continued to provide phone service to \ninmates in the state.37 In 2015, the FCC expanded the price \ncaps to in-state calls, making them as low as 11 cents per \nminute, and lowered the cost of calls from jails to between 14 \ncents and 22 cents, depending on the size of the institution.38 \nCenturyLink, GTL, Pay-Tel, Securus, and Telmate sued the \nFCC.39 In 2017, the US Court of Appeals struck down the \nFCC’s 2015 rate-cap ruling.40\nExhibit 6 History of Aventiv’s Call Costs to Consumer, Including Commissions\nYear\nCost per Minute\nAvg Minutes per Call \nTotal Cost of a Call\n2011\n$0.271\n12.44\n$3.37\n2012\n$0.254\n12.72\n$3.23\n2013\n$0.259\n12.90\n$3.34\n2014\n$0.248\n12.42\n$3.08\n2015\n$0.223\n11.88\n$2.65\n2016\n$0.212\n11.27\n$2.39\n2017\n$0.208\n10.63\n$2.21\n2018\n$0.172\n10.93\n$1.88\n2019\n$0.142\n11.06\n$1.57\n2020\n$0.137\n11.39\n$1.56\nSource: Aventiv Technologies; used with permission.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

A few months later, Securus \nsued the state in Securus v. Christie to declare that this new rate \ncap constituted an unconstitutional taking of private property. \nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of New Jersey \nand partner organizations argued that the state was within its \nrights to limit rates. In New Jersey, African Americans were \nincarcerated at 12 times the rate of white people, so high phone \nrates disproportionately affected people of color.41 An ACLU \nrepresentative commented, “It’s wrong to exploit a literal cap-\ntive market, which is exactly why New Jersey put limits on \nphone rates in prisons.”42 The state of New Jersey successfully \ndismissed Securus’ suit and its later appeal.43\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many facilities and \nregions gave breaks for phone calls. Aventiv provided over \n35 million free call credits during the first year of the pan-\ndemic.44 But some thought free calls should be made perma-\nnent. Such advocates argued that free calls should be consid-\nered a cost of the institution, like plumbing and electricity, \nand thus be borne by the taxpayer.45 In 2019, New York City \nbecame the first major city to make phone calls free from \nits city jails (previously, inmates were charged 50 cents for \nthe first minute and 5 cents for each additional minute).46 \nIn August 2020, San Francisco began offering free calls and \nending markups to items sold through the prison commis-\nsary.47 In May 2021, the San Diego County Board of Supervi-\nsors voted to prohibit county-run jails and juvenile detention \nfacilities from charging for phone calls (which had cost 21 \ncents per minute for interstate calls and 33 cents per minute \nfor local and in-state calls).48 Abel explained that Aventiv \nwould provide service regardless of the decision of each com-\nmunity. “We will not restrict or deny service based on who \npays the bills…Let’s agree on a fair price for provision of the \nservice and we will provide service.”\nWhile other states and facilities could follow suit, most \ncorrections decision-makers continued to include requests \nfor commissions in 2021 contract RFPs reviewed by Aven-\ntiv. Philosophies differed by state and county. A Securus \nrepresentative explained: “Washington is very different than \nGeorgia.” Platinum called off Securus lobbying efforts in \nConnecticut in 2019, where lawmakers were considering a \nbill that would make the state the first in the nation to pro-\nvide free phone calls to prisoners.49 Abel explained that the \nnew Aventiv approach was to not lobby for or against com-\nmissions. “That is a local community decision.” Aventiv also \nfound that, in the case of New York City at least, removing \ncommissions lowered the price to the consumer and changed \ncalling patterns. Abel explained, “What was interesting about \nit is, though, Securus’ profitability went nearly unchanged \nactually, while consumer volume increased because calling \npatterns shifted dramatically once unconstrained by pricing.”\nA Change Is Gonna Come\nOn May 20, 2021, the FCC voted unanimously to cap the rates \nof interstate phone calls to 12 cents per minute, down from \nthe previous 21-cent-per-minute cap.50 Change, it seemed, was \ncoming. In July, Securus announced it would change stance \nto fully embrace the FCC’s Interim Order on Inmate Com-\nmunications Services, supporting the rate caps and other new \nregulations, and take a public position calling for the elimi-\nnation of site commissions. Abel said, “We believe it is long \noverdue for our industry to stop fighting with reform-minded \nregulators and legislators. Instead, we need to adopt a more \ncollaborative approach that balances the needs of the incar-\ncerated individuals and their families who use and pay for our \nservices and the corrections agencies that contract for them.”\nOn the issue of commissions, the company took its neu-\ntral position a step further. Abel said, “Securus wants to work \nwith all stakeholders to eliminate commissions and we need \nto collectively find a way to honor affordability commitments \nand also raise funds for important programs. Securus will \npass the savings from the elimination of calling commissions \nand reductions in taxes and fees directly through to the con-\nsumer.” Securus also called on the FCC to make sure new \nregulations allowed for new approaches to contracting that \nwould further reduce costs for consumers. The company \nnoted that subscription calling plans, which allowed incar-\ncerated callers to pay a monthly fee rather than pay per call, \nwere found to increase call time by 27% and reduce costs by \n50% in a Securus pilot program, but regulations prohibited \nsubscription models in correctional institutions. Securus \nbelieved the FCC should update its regulations to allow for a \nsubscription model, as advocates and justice-involved fami-\nlies had also been calling for, and hoped to file for an exemp-\ntion that would allow the company to expand its existing \nsubscription model.\nAventiv was already piloting a model in several different \nprisons that would effectively lower the price of calls to as \nlow as 2 cents per minutes while making additional money \non music and video streaming along with other add-on ser-\nvices from the tablet. Not everyone at the company thought \nthat would work. “I don’t think that model is sustainable,” \nsaid Andrew Becker. That also assumed that commissions \nwere not added on top of the base rate for phone calls. Still, \nAventiv seemed insistent on trying different models to see \nwhat worked. Figuring out what would stick came down to \n“discussions and testing,” according to Abel. The company \nwas considering including several different pricing structures \nto offer in future RFPs.\nBecker wondered if the scoring of the telecom contracts \nby consultants/agencies (which took about 9% of the com-\nmission the prison received) was a way to effect change. \n“Sometimes they’ll say, ‘Oh, it’s all about the technology,’ but \nwhen you get down to the scoring—they choose the person \nwith the highest commissions,” Becker said. “People look-\ning at scoring from the outside might ask, ‘Does this really \nalign with social change?’” Becker also wondered why the \nFCC didn’t just lower its own taxes charged to inmates in \nthe form of interstate calls, where a 33.4% tax went to fund \nthe Universal Service Fund (used to promote universal access \nto telecommunications in the United States).51 “It’s no differ-\nent than commissions…If they wanted to lower rates, why \nwouldn’t they eliminate those taxes on inmate calling?”\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

So, case in point, when I piloted this new pricing pro-\ngram, on our invoices, now it says ‘Securus fee $19,’ ‘agency \ncommission $43,’ and then we total it out because everyone \nthinks that we are charging an arm and a leg, when in reality \nwe have some customers that require 80% commission and \nmore.” On the one hand, the high prices from commissions \nbranded Aventiv in a way that made it harder to achieve its \nmission; on the other hand, there weren’t any revenues if the \ncustomers weren’t happy. “It’s a risky situation and we know \nit,” Gores said. “We’re playing with fire a little bit in that we’re \ngiving the commission system a little pushback. But who \nelse is going to do it? I think if we can be leaders, eventually \neveryone is going to have to follow.”\nWhile much needed to change, Aventiv had already come \na long way. Phillips explained, “Few people understand the \nrealities for consumers 13 years ago to today. We have come \na long way and we can continue to grow, because the soci-\nety and technology continues to adapt and evolve. We have \nand will continue to find really innovative ways to operate in \nwhat is a really challenging environment.” Kelly Brooks said, \n“I really like the direction the new executive team is going. So \nmany new programs. More consumer focused. So many new \ninitiatives.” Abel acknowledged that the company had farther \nto go, though. “I want this company to lead the change.”\nPiloting new business models showed that Aventiv was \nreacting to the needs of its stakeholders, but it seemed to be \nan impossibility to try to sign deals with corrections facilities \nwithout offering commissions. A deal up for bid in May 2021 \nin Georgia required commissions. Becker summarized the \nrisk of squeezing too hard: “You can’t make change if you \ndon’t have any business.” And Phillips added, “To reform the \nindustry, you have to have contracts, and the competitors in \nthis business make it difficult…That’s why the industry has \nto be regulated.” Radical change in the industry seemed hard \nunless the rules of the game changed. “The question is, are \nyou going to be in front of that, helping lead those changes, or \nare you going to be behind that curve getting dragged toward \nchange?” Mark Barnhill said. “We choose to try and lead.”\nYusef Jackson, an attorney, activist, and entrepreneur \nhired as a senior executive at Aventiv and a senior adviser to \nPlatinum in mid-2021, acknowledged that Aventiv “has been \ncriticized for its high rates and fees, and, quite frankly, for \nbeing part of the problem. But over the last 18 months, the \ncompany has taken steps to become part of the solution by \ninitiating a transformation of its culture and business prac-\ntices, changing management, reducing its fee structure, and \npromoting policy that focuses on rehabilitation and reduc-\ning recidivism.” Jackson continued, “To modernize these \nsystems—replacing rudimentary wall phones with tablets \nenabled with SMS, email, apps, video calling, e-books, and so \non—we must invest. To innovate, develop, and deliver tech-\nnology that not only connects but also improves, empowers, \nand changes the lives of those who are incarcerated, we must \ninvest. We envision a system that provides every inmate with \na secure digital tablet so they can connect with loved ones \nand access educational offerings, faith-based programming, \nmental health resources, job training, employment resources, \nand second-chance programs that improve reentry outcomes. \nOf the 11 million Americans who churn through the prison \nindustrial complex and the over 2 million incarcerated, up to \n95% will be released. Imagine a society where people come \nout better prepared than when they entered. We have the \nopportunity to make this a reality.”\nWhile the vision sounded good, skeptics wondered \nwhether the company could move fast enough and lead the \ntype of significant change needed. “The work always has to \nspeak for itself,” said Gores, who was personally all in on \nchanging the culture and direction of Aventiv and, ultimately, \nthe industry. “You can’t talk your way out of this situation. \nYou need to execute. It takes what I’ve done my whole life \nbut do in a bit of a different format. I know how to execute, \npull people together, and now I just have to take all of those \nskills…and throw them into this.”\nNotes\n1. This is a field-based case.

They just called and want our help \nevaluating their business model and disruption threats.”\n“Of course I know Blue Apron. I’m actually a customer \nof theirs.”\nThomas had been a customer of Blue Apron for the past \nthree months, after receiving a $130 gift card for the service \nas a birthday present. She had decided to keep using Blue \nApron when she found bi-weekly meal kits to be high qual-\nity, affordable, and convenient. The company’s tagline was \n“A meal kit built for your busy lifestyle.”1 Thomas and her \nboyfriend, another McKinsey consultant from the Metals and \nMining group, liked having Blue Apron meals handy in their \ncondo. Neither had time to shop, but they liked to cook. Blue \nApron meals had supplied special ingredients in just the right \namounts to create yummy creations like Crispy Skin Salmon \nwith Salsa Verde and Farro Salad or Cheesy Pork Chorizo \nEnchiladas with Bell Pepper and Rice. Thomas had always \nwanted to learn to cook better, but hadn’t found the time. \nBlue Apron and a bottle of white wine had become her recipe \nfor a cozy date night.\n“Well, that’s good. Actually, my family used Blue Apron \nfor a year too—but then we dropped it,” Ramos said. “I guess \ntoo many other customers have been dropping them as well, \nlately.”\n“They’ve got competition from meal-kit providers like \nHelloFresh, Plated, and Home Chef, right?” Thomas recalled \nanalysis she had done for a previous pitch—it had showed \nthat some of McKinsey’s Agriculture clients were selling an \nincreasing amount of product to Blue Apron’s competitors.\n“That’s true,” Ramos conceded, “but that’s only part of the \nproblem. Walmart and Amazon are threats—you never want \nthem as competitors. But Blue Apron is also concerned with \nthe more recent rise of Instacart and delivery platforms like \nUber Eats. That’s why they called.”\n“Shouldn’t this mandate be handled by our Retail group?” \nThomas asked.\n“It’s going to be a joint proposal, actually,” Ramos said. \n“Blue Apron is a farm-to-table play, so they called us in. And \nwhile Instacart and Uber Eats aren’t Agriculture clients, I said \nwe’d give a first crack at a global strategy recommendation. So \nI thought you’d be the best to take a crack at breaking down \nthe supply chain. Evaluate the threats.”\n“Okay. What’s the deadline?”\n“I’ve asked for one week. But I’d like your initial thoughts \nby Wednesday morning.”\nThe Beginnings of Blue Apron\nThomas decided the place to start on her inquiry was with \nBlue Apron itself. She quickly pulled up the stock chart for \nAPRN and saw the company had about a $160 million market \ncap.2 “Not bad,” she thought. But then she noticed that the \ncompany had been valued at $2 billion on the private market \nin 2015 before going public. Investors in that round were \ndown 91%. Clearly the earth had been shifting underneath \nthe company. What happened? Thomas figured she needed \nto understand the past before she could help advise on where \nthings might be heading.\nBlue Apron was founded in 2012, when 28-year-old \nMatt Salzberg, a Harvard MBA and an associate at Besse-\nmer Venture Partners, partnered with Ilia Papas to create a \nbusiness. They raised a friends-and-family round of money \nand tried a few start-up ideas before coming up with the Blue \nApron concept: giving people an easy way to make dinner \nusing trusted, chef-recommended recipes, including all the \ningredients they’d need, precisely measured out.3 Blue Apron \nhadn’t pioneered the idea. Linas Matkasse, a Swedish sub-\nscription meal service launched in 2008, had grown to nearly \n$50 million in sales. Blue Apron’s thought was to offer recipes \nto subscribers each week and build relationships with local \nfarmers, creating menus based on seasonal ingredients.\nWith no food experience, Salzberg (who would become \nthe CEO) and Papas (who was chief technical officer), turned \nto chef Matt Wadiak, who had been trained at the Culinary \nInstitute of America. Wadiak was a wholesaler of truffles and \navocados and catered dinners for Salzberg’s mother-in-law. \nSoon, Wadiak joined Blue Apron’s board, then became its \nCOO. The food needed to be portioned correctly, then pack-\naged and delivered quickly, within 24 hours, to assure that it \nwas fresh. The pricing was set at $9.99 per person, later $8.74 \nper person for a two-to-four-person family.4 The company’s \nname came from the tradition of beginner cooks wearing a \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The product made cooking \nsuper easy, with all the ingredients supplied in the correct \npre-measured quantities, complete with step-by-step instruc-\ntions that usually included photos and sometimes even videos. \nSalzberg, Papas, and Wadiak packed and shipped the first  \n30 orders themselves from a commercial kitchen in Long \nIsland City.\nEarly testers could order meals based on one main pro-\ntein: fish, poultry, or a choice of beef or pork. Wadiak helped \nbuild the initial relationships with farms and food provid-\ners and a courier mailed the first orders across Manhattan. \nBeta testers loved the products and shared photos on social \nmedia of what they made. Demand took off instantly. “Pretty \nmuch from day one we’ve had steady exponential customer \ngrowth. I think the moment we did our first week of deliv-\neries we sort of knew that we had a business that we thought \nwould be really successful.”5 If the trio ran low on ingredients, \nthey’d run to a local grocery store. The early demand helped \nthe founders raise a $3 million Series A financing round at \na $9 million valuation in February 2013. Six months later, \nthey raised an additional $5 million Series B at a $30 million \nvaluation.\nIn time, the business proposition to customers centered \non the notion of making food that was healthier than takeout, \neasier to produce than cooking from scratch, and cheaper \nthan hiring a private chef or relying on meal delivery. Busy \nprofessionals and rural foodies would thus be able to order \nthe ingredients for interesting dishes like crispy catfish with \nkale-farro salad and warm grape relish or shokichi squash \nragù and Mafalda pasta with mushrooms with just a few \nclicks of their mouse or taps in a mobile app.6 What seemed \nto excite investors most, however, was the chance to disinter-\nmediate the supply chain.\nA Shortcut in the Food Supply Chain\nWhile seasonally rotating unique recipes in meal kits deliv-\nered in sustainable packaging helped drive demand, Blue \nApron believed a key value proposition was its ability to buy \ndirect from the farm or food manufacturer and sell direct \nto end customers. Wadiak said, “I think that there is a great \nopportunity today to create, through technology, a leaner \nfood system that cuts out the various steps between the con-\nsumer and supplier.” (Exhibit 1.) Theoretically, this avoided \nintermediaries and allowed the company to pass savings on \nto the customer. The model echoed that of Warby Parker \n(founded in 2010), which had built a big business by success-\nfully cutting out go-betweens in the eyewear supply chain to \ndeliver designer frames to consumers at a value price. Wadiak \nworked to build hundreds of relationships with local farm-\ners, ranchers, and pasta makers to provide fresh products. By \nNovember 2014, Blue Apron was shipping one million meals \nper month. In April 2014, the company raised $50 million and \nwas valued at $500 million.\nBy 2015, the company was selling a reported three mil-\nlion meals per month at about $10 per meal and claiming \nSource: Created by authors.\nExhibit 1 Food Supply Chain\nFarms\nFood Processor\nFood Processor\nFields\nRestaurant\nChannel\nGrocery\nChannel\nDistributor\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

One farmer \nwith 800 acres in Oakley, California, met Wadiak at a sus-\ntainable agriculture conference a year after Blue Apron’s \nfounding, and two years later, he was selling entire acres of \nsweet corn and beans to the company. He was in talks to \nsell more obscure ingredients too, such as zucchini blossoms \nand purslane, an edible weed that grew next to his beans.8 \nThe more of the farmer’s land that could be converted to \norganic crops, the more Blue Apron offered to purchase. Blue \nApron’s growth meant it had to execute precision logistics \nat enormous volume. Ingredients had to be measured, cut, \nprepped, bagged, packed, palletized, and shipped.9 Healthy, \nappealing recipes had to be created with affordable ingre-\ndients procured from purveyors of produce, meat, cheese, \nbread, and spices, and hundreds of family-run farms. It was \na massive undertaking.\nIn June 2015, the company raised $135 million at a  \n$2 billion valuation. The money was earmarked to continue \ngrowing Blue Apron’s 1,800 employee staff, adding to posi-\ntions in fulfillment, marketing, technology, operations, and \npurchasing. The company was busy developing in-house \nsoftware tools to manage purchasing, fulfillment operations, \ne-commerce, ordering, shipping, and customer service. \nThree fulfillment centers had been built in Jersey City, New \nJersey; Arlington, Texas; and Richmond, California; and \nmore were planned. In 2015, Salzberg said, “We source from \nfarms locally to different regional fulfillment centers. So if \nyou’re in California you are generally getting produce from \na California farm. We have a whole team of people whose \njob it is to go out, meet farmers, build those relationships. \nToday we are literally at the point in the company’s life where \nwe are planting items in the ground with farms just for us...\nWhat it allows us to do is work with the farmers to plan their \nproduction in a way that allows them to be more seasonal, \nmore efficient and utilize their resources better which results \nin higher quality crops for us and for our customers at lower \nprices for them.”10\nCustomers also seemed to like that ingredients were \nsustainably sourced and that the company supported local \nand family-owned businesses. Blue Apron even used some \nof the new funds to start a wine-subscription business in \n2015, going directly to vineyards to create custom Blue \nApron wines to uniquely pair with meals. Growth seemed \nlimitless.\nVulnerabilities in the Value \nProposition?\nBlue Apron’s founders believed that its core product was the \nexperience it offered its customers. The company strived to \nbuild a “consumer lifestyle brand that symbolizes the emo-\ntional human connections that are formed through the \ncooking experiences we create.”11 Blue Apron’s processes \naimed to increase efficiencies, ultimately leading to increased \nprofitability. By 2016, the company had 4,000 employees, sell-\ning eight million meal kits per month. \nFor a fast-growing company, some amount of growing \npains were assumed. Thomas came across reports that a \nformer team lead at Blue Apron had said, “There were plenty \nof times where the kitchen would say we had 2,000 celery, but \nwe actually had zero…I would get sent to Whole Foods and \nbuy things if we really needed an ingredient and we didn’t \nhave it in the building.”12\nThomas could see the appeal of the service as a way to \nrestore a family to the tradition of sitting at the dinner table \ntogether. Home-cooked meals were an important factor con-\ntributing to a family’s health and general well-being. But did \nhealthy eating require cooking? Thomas wasn’t sure. Cook-\ning required time, the lack of which was a primary reason \npeople gave for not preparing food at home. Blue Apron \ntried to simplify this process and customers seemed to like \nthe product, at least for a while. Forty-two percent of Blue \nApron’s customers in 2017 were acquired through their cus-\ntomer referral program. Thomas wondered, though, about \ncustomer retention. Blue Apron seemed like a smart, easy \nway to learn to cook, but once people had learned their way \naround the kitchen, wouldn’t they want to shop from the gro-\ncery store themselves? It surely would be cheaper. Salzberg \nsaid, “People are interested in cooking things that they hadn’t \ncooked before. They are interested in trying new ingredients. \nPart of the reason we can work with ingredients that a gro-\ncery store doesn’t have is because we taught you how to work \nwith them…We’re generating demand for these kind of prod-\nucts in a way that grocery stores can’t generate demand.”13 In \nJune 2017, Blue Apron made its IPO at $10 per share, a price \nthat valued Blue Apron at just under $2 billion—but the deal \nwas priced 34% below the original range set by Wall Street \nbankers.\nWhen Thomas pulled up Blue Apron’s financials, she \nexpected to see some evidence of the company’s efficien-\ncies of scale. (Exhibit 2.) While it had grown its revenues, so \ntoo had it grown its losses. Thomas understood the Silicon \nValley ethos of spending excess marketing dollars to grow \nsales, but what about profits? Thomas wondered about the \nsustainability of the business model. Still, the market was \nenormous—the US grocery market was near $780 billion \nwith just a 1.2% online penetration, and the US restaurant \nmarket was near $540 billion with a 2.2% online penetration. \nThe global restaurant market was almost five times larger.14 \nIn 2017, the company’s two-person plan represented 79% of \nmeal orders. 21% were for the four-person family plan.15 Blue \nApron remained “committed to sourcing fresh, high-quality \ningredients from farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and artisans \nyear round.”16 The company stressed that its beef, poultry, \nand pork came from animals given exclusively vegetarian \nfeed with no added hormones or antibiotics. It sourced only \nnon-GMO ingredients and bought mostly from organic pro-\nducers. “A lot of our farmers are medium- and small-sized \nfarms instead of these larger commercial farms,” explained \nSalzberg.17\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

(Exhibit 3.) This occurred even though marketing \nexpenses had risen to $154.5 million in 2017, up from $144.1 \nmillion in 2016. Soon, though, quality issues put a tempo-\nrary halt to marketing. As a result, profitability sank, as \nexpected. Analysts also pointed to extremely labor-intensive \nassembly processes where most costs of operations (includ-\ning shipping and packaging) were not reflected in the com-\npany’s pricing structure. Some thought the company should \nraise prices to achieve profitability, but that would just drive \nmore customers away. The company began to retrench, \nfocusing on margin improvements through improved pro-\nductivity and expense control. Headcount was reduced and \ndecision-making responsibilities were streamlined to ensure \ngreater accountability. Construction of a Fairfield, California, \nfulfillment center was halted, given the reduced sales outlook. \nThe Jersey City fulfillment center transitioned all its pro-\nduction volume to the company’s new Linden, New Jersey, \nfacility, which boasted state-of-the-art technology though \nits efficiencies and profitability lagged behind the other two \nfacilities in Arlington and Richmond.\nIn November 2017, Salzberg stepped down as CEO but \nremained chairman, and Brad Dickerson took the CEO title. \nBetween 2017 and 2019, Blue Apron cut marketing outlays \nfurther, resulting in more customers fleeing. In April 2019, \nLinda Findley Kozlowski replaced Dickerson as CEO. In the \nsecond quarter of 2020, Blue Apron closed its Arlington ful-\nfillment facility.\nThomas checked Google trends to understand the \nsearch picture and general interest in the term “Blue Apron,” \nand noticed that it seemed to have peaked in early 2017 \n(Exhibit 4). Customer retention had always been an issue in \nthe industry—Blue Apron’s churn was close to 25% for the \nfirst two years of a customer using the service. This trans-\nlated into a $95 customer acquisition cost. An average cus-\ntomer spent about $1,000 per year in 2017 and produced 30% \ngross margins, but these numbers had increased in 2021 to \nabout $1,250 per year, with a 33% gross margin.18 There were \nmany potential reasons for Blue Apron’s faltering growth, but \nThomas thought the biggest problem Blue Apron faced might \nbe related to the rise of competitors and new disrupters in the \nindustry.\nCompetition\nAccording to the Blue Apron annual reports that Thomas \nscrolled through, the company faced competition from six \nareas: other food and meal delivery companies, the supermar-\nket industry, food retailers, casual dining and quick-service \nrestaurants, wine retailers, and food manufacturers. The \nmeal-kit industry was highly fragmented: companies com-\npeted heavily on price, the quality of the offering, and con-\nvenience. In the United States, the industry was estimated \nto be worth almost $7 billion in 2021 and was projected to \ngrow to $10 billion by 2024.19 Twenty-five percent of people \nliving in cities had tried meal-kit services, compared to just \nExhibit 2 Blue Apron Historical Financials\nYear Ended December 31,\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n(in thousands of US dollars)\nNet revenue\n$ 340,803\n$ 795,416\n$ 881,191\n$ 667,600\n$ 454,868\n$ 460,608\n$ 470,377\nOperating expenses:\nCost of goods sold (COGS)\n263,271\n532,682\n627,964\n433,496\n279,135\n282,924\n301,763\nMarketing\n51,362\n144,141\n154,529\n117,455\n48,133\n49,934\n72,086\nProduct, technology, general, \nand administrative\n70,151\n165,179\n247,907\n194,340\n144,925\n137,244\n145,442\nDepreciation and amortization\n2,917\n8,217\n26,838\n34,517\n31,200\n24,503\n22,203\nOther operating expense\n                –\n                –\n12,713\n2,170\n3,571\n4,567\n             0\nTotal operating expenses\n387,701\n850,219\n1,069,951\n781,978\n506,964\n499,172\n541,494\nIncome (loss) from operations\n(46,898)\n(54,803)\n(188,760)\n(114,378)\n(52,096)\n(38,564)\n(71,117)\nNet income (loss)\n$ (46,965)\n$ (54,886)\n$(210,143)\n$(122,149)\n$ (61,081)\n$ (46,154)\n$ (88,381)\nEBITDA\n(43,981)\n(46,586)\n(161,922)\n(79,861)\n(20,896)\n(14,061)\n(48,914)\nData source: “Blue Apron:Citron Research Joining the Party,” Seeking Alpha, January 21, 2022, https://seekingalpha.com/article/4480745-blue-apron-stock-citron-research-peloton \n-acquisition (accessed Mar. 2, 2022).\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In addition to Blue Apron, three \npublicly traded peers existed: HelloFresh, Marley Spoon, and \nGoodfood (which was only in Canada). There were also more \nthan 100  other private competitors. Better-known global \nexamples included Home Chef, EveryPlate, Sunbasket, Din-\nnerly, Plated, Purple Carrot (which was entirely plant based), \nMaria, Ooooby, Gousto, Nutrisystem, Diet-To-Go, Gobble, \nand My Food Bag.\nSince 2016, the Germany-based HelloFresh had risen as \nBlue Apron’s prime challenger in terms of active subscrib-\ners, based on its growth in the United States and internation-\nally (Exhibit 5). It had taken the lead in the United States \nin 2018.21 HelloFresh launched in 2012, and 40% of its sales \ncame from outside the United States. HelloFresh had opera-\ntions in Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Belgium, the United \nKingdom, the United States, Australia, Switzerland, Canada, \nand Luxemburg. HelloFresh utilized a data-driven approach, \nwhich helped it to more efficiently spend its marketing  \ndollars to optimize customer acquisition while executing on \nthe logistics end. The minimum spend for HelloFresh was \n$54.95 per week, which paid for two two-serving meals at \n$11.49 per serving plus $8.99 shipping. By comparison, Blue \nApron’s minimum spend per week was $47.95. On the high \nend (eight four-serving meals) HelloFresh cost $245.67, \nincluding $5.99 shipping, while Blue Apron charged $239.68 \nfor the same number, and offered free shipping.22 HelloFresh \nand other competitors offered new customers as much as $30 \noff on orders and offered lapsed customers $25 off.\nPricing was competitive—the average meal price ranged \nfrom about $5.00 to $11.50 (Exhibit  6). Competition had \nalready forced prominent closures from Chef’d in 2018 (after \nthree years of service), Munchery in 2019 (after nine years of \nservice) and PeachDish in 2019 (after five years in service). \nSixty-three percent of potential customers in the United \nStates cited price as the reason for not using meal kits.23 There \nhad also been some consolidation in the market (Exhibit 7.) \nMany supermarket chains like Kroger had started to sell \ntheir own meal kits and created hot bars and ready-to-go \nmeal options to cater to customers seeking convenience and \nhigh-quality products at a reasonable price. Albertsons had \neven directly joined the meal-kit competition by acquiring \nPlated for $300 million in 2017. Eight months later, Kroger \nacquired Home Chef. Optimism for global growth in the \nindustry continued to be strong despite setbacks. The size \nof the global meal-kit industry was expected to grow to  \n$24 billion by 2027 (Exhibit 8). In early 2022, Gousto raised \n$100 million from SoftBank’s Vision Fund, showing venture \nfunds’ continued interest in the space. \nAmazon was also making its own push into the business. \nIn 2017, Amazon launched AmazonFresh, a grocery-delivery \nservice that allowed users to shop online, reserve times to \npick up groceries, and have them loaded into their car. Soon, \nthe company started selling meal kits ranging in price from \n$16 to $20. In 2019, Amazon began to offer one-to-two-hour \ndelivery of meat, seafood, eggs, and produce in a test market, \nand in 2020, AmazonFresh started building a new chain of \nphysical grocery stores while continuing to offer home deliv-\nery on the same or the next day for grocery items, includ-\ning meal kits. Amazon also acquired Whole Foods for over  \n$13 billion in 2017, operating it independently from \nExhibit 4 Google Trends results for “Blue Apron”\nSource: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2012-01-07%20\n2022-02-07&geo=US&q=blue%20apron (accessed Mar. 2, 2022).

The pre-packaged \nmeals were made in-store daily and each two-person kit sold \nfor $8 to $15. Walmart also partnered with Home Chef, Sun-\nbasket, and Takeout Kit to offer delivered meal kits for two or \nfour people, starting at $29.99.25 Walmart’s subscription-only \nstore Sam’s Club also teamed up to offer home delivery of \ngroceries by partnering with a newer player on the scene: \nInstacart.\nInstacart Spies an Opportunity\nInstacart was founded in 2012 by a former Amazon supply \nchain engineer named Apoorva Mehta, who had helped \ndevelop fulfillment systems to move packages from the ware-\nhouse to a customer’s home. Mehta coded the initial Instacart \napp himself. It allowed customers to order groceries from \npartner stores to be delivered by an Instacart “shopper,” who \ngrabbed customer items from the shelves and delivered them \nto the customer’s home quickly, sometimes in under an hour. \nShoppers downloaded an app that provided work opportu-\nnities (like Uber) and paid them $20 or more per hour plus \ntip. Efficient shoppers could earn about $45 per hour.26 Insta-\ncart charged a delivery fee between $3.99 to $9.99, depending \non demand and external conditions (such as weather). The \nstore and Instacart split the fee. There was also a subscrip-\ntion service that allowed unlimited deliveries, cheaper service \nfees, and no surge pricing for an annual $99 fee or a monthly \n$9.99 fee.27\nThe company partnered with national and regional retail-\ners such as Albertsons, Aldi, Costco, Loblaw, Publix, Sam’s \nClub, Sprouts, and Wegmans.28 The company also offered \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Later, Instacart expanded to a prescrip-\ntion delivery service, allowing medications to be delivered \nfrom partners such as CVS and Walgreens. By the end of \n2021, Instacart had partnered with more than 600 retailers \nfrom almost 55,000 stores in over 5,500 cities in the United \nStates (accessible by over 85% of US households) and Canada \n(accessible by 80% of Canadian households).29\nOne of the issues Thomas noted with Blue Apron’s model \nwas that some people liked to shop for ingredients them-\nselves and buy in scale. Wasn’t that how one saved money \nby cooking at home? Instacart had a place on its site that \nlisted trending recipes. While Thomas didn’t think Insta-\ncart’s recipes were as creative as Blue Apron recipes, there \nwere dishes like charred shrimp and pesto Buddha bowls, \norange chicken stir-fry with rice noodles, egg salad avocado \ntoast, and hasselback caprese chicken.30 The customer could \nsearch for a recipe that looked good and, with one click, \norder all the ingredients, which would often make enough \nfor a family to eat. There was also a part of the site dedicated \nto ready-to-eat meals for those who wanted to do minimal \ncooking.31\nIn October 2021, Sunbasket (founded in 2014) joined \nInstacart’s marketplace, becoming the first meal-kit com-\npany on the same-day-delivery company’s platform in \nselect markets.32 The partnership allowed customers to get \nthe benefit of a meal kit without a subscription to a service. \nThe price started at $11.99 per serving and customers could \nchoose breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks on the following \nweek’s menu. Sunbasket catered to a wide variety of tastes \nand dietary needs with offerings called Chef’s Choice, Paleo, \nLean & Clean, Gluten-Free, Vegetarian, Pescatarian, Mediter-\nranean, Diabetes-Friendly, Fresh & Ready, Pre-Prepped, and \nCarb-Conscious.33 \nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a surge for Insta-\ncart’s business as customers quarantining at home rushed to \nhave their food delivered. In the space of month (March to \nApril) 2020, the company hired 300,000 workers. In March \n2021, Instacart raised $265 million at a valuation of $39 billion \nfrom investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia, \nalong with Fidelity and T. Rowe Price.34\nUber Eats and the Delivery Platforms\nLaunched in 2014, Uber Eats was an online food-order plat-\nform that allowed users to purchase takeout foods from \nin-network partner restaurants. The food was delivered by \npeople who logged on to the UberEats app and were paid \n$15 or more per hour. Uber Eats also allowed Uber drivers to \nincrease their utilization and earnings by accessing demand \nduring nonpeak transport times. Restaurant merchants ben-\nefited with incremental demand, a new mobile presence, and \nefficient delivery capabilities. Uber Eats charged a delivery \nfee of $2 to $8, based on the distance the driver had to go. For \nsome orders, that fee could be between 13% and 40% of the \ntotal. Some complained that this fee was exorbitant, given the \nfact that the average restaurant profit per order was between \n3% and 9% of revenue.\nUber Eats competitors included DoorDash, Grubhub \n(which was acquired by Takeaway for $7.3 billion in June  \n2021), Deliveroo, and Caviar. Uber acquired competitor  \nPostmates for $2.65 billion in December 2020. Other  \nrapid-delivery/quick-commerce platforms that had raised \nsignificant funding included Getir ($550  million in June \n2021) and JOKR ($170 million in July 2021).35\nDelivery platforms like Uber Eats made their money \nthrough restaurant commission fees (usually, restaurants \npaid between 15% and 30% of the price of the meal), cus-\ntomer delivery fees (between $2 and $8 collected from the \ncustomer), customer service fees, in-app advertising, and \ntips. Before the pandemic, the restaurant industry was grow-\ning about 3% to 4% per year. The trend toward convenience \nby Gen Z consumers who preferred prepared meals contrib-\nuted to delivery sales that were growing at double the rate of \nthe restaurant industry.\nThen the pandemic hit, lockdowns were established, \nand delivery platforms like Uber Eats saw a 30% rise in new \ncustomers. Food delivery was estimated to be a $150 billion \nglobal market in 2021—it had tripled since 2017.36 Thomas \nnoted that in recent years, there had also been a prolifer-\nation of “dark kitchens” or “ghost kitchens”: delivery-first \nor delivery-only restaurant models that lowered business \noverhead and thus could afford to pay delivery platforms \nhigher commissions to be more prominently featured on \nthe apps.\nDecisions\nIt was Tuesday evening, the night before Thomas’s recom-\nmendations were due to her boss. Thomas believed her \nresearch had given her a sense of the competitive landscape, \nbut wasn’t sure what to recommend. She wondered if a more \ngranular approach would be helpful.\nShe thought of the Blue Apron Crispy Skin Salmon with \nSalsa Verde and Farro Salad she had made recently. “What if I \ntried to buy something like this from other competitors?” she \nwondered. Thomas knew she couldn’t get the exact dish from \nan Instacart or Uber Eats, but thought it might be interesting \nto ask how much a similar dish (or the ingredients for it) \nwould cost. Thomas went to the Blue Apron site, found the \ndish, and wrote out the ingredients:\n2 skin-on salmon fillets\n1/2 cup semi-pearled farro\n1 zucchini\n1 red onion\n2 cloves garlic\n1 lemon\n1/3 cup salsa verde\n1 and 1/2 tbsp golden raisins\n1 oz. Castelvetrano olives\n1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

The Instacart order came from Mariano’s, a  \ngrocery near Thomas’s apartment. She figured if she didn’t \nwant to pay the $8.99 delivery cost, she could walk a few \nblocks to the store herself. But wasn’t her time worth more \nthan that?\nThomas also wondered about the scale advantage inher-\nent in supermarkets. Blue Apron hadn’t turned a profit yet. \nGrocery stores had notoriously low margins—between 1% \nand 3% per item, typically.37 But they could make private-label \nproducts, which yielded a 35% margin versus 26% for national \nbrands.38 Their goal was to maximize sales volume through \nthe store, so Thomas figured the Instacart business could be \nhelpful to them. But Thomas also thought about the scale in \ntheir buying. She knew that grocery stores often bypassed \nwholesalers to buy directly from local farms, just like Blue \nApron did. But top grocery chains were quite a bit larger than \nBlue Apron. Kroger had sales of $132 billion in 2021.39 And \nWalmart and Amazon were massive. Could Blue Apron really \nhope to compete in the changing landscape?

In an interview with \nthe Stanford Graduate School of Business, Syngal directly \naddressed the 70% loss of revenue and $140 million in cash \nspending per week that occurred at the height of the COVID-19 \npandemic, and how she plans to lead the executive leadership \nteam to redefine their purpose. Syngal emphasized the deci-\nsion to become “inclusive by design” and to use that as Gap’s \nguiding North Star as it makes decisions, both big and small, \ngoing forward.1\nGap, previously known as The Gap Stores, Inc., seeks to \nbecome the most inclusive company in the world through \nimplementing an action plan focused on strengthening \nemployee, customer, and community belonging. The com-\npany uses something called the Authenticity Equation as a \nframework for its inclusive decision-making.2 The frame-\nwork uses three components of authenticity—a considered \napproached, a connected process and output, and consistent \nengagement—to ensure Gap’s brands and products manifest \nits promise.\nImplementation of this framework is mapped out in Gap’s \nPower Plan 2023 strategy, a three- year vision put forth to \ngrow purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands that shape \npeople’s way of life and deliver consistent growth through \nomni-dominance, an approach to sales that integrates distri-\nbution, promotion and communication to provide customers \nwith a seamless shopping experience.3\nAlthough Gap has faced and still faces a great deal of vol-\natility and uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic and intense market competition, things are improving. \nIn fact, Gap had $16.7 billion in revenue in the fiscal year \nending in January 2022, slightly higher than pre- COVID \nrevenue. The company also turned a fiscal year loss of $665 \nmillion in 2021 into a gain of $256 million in 2022. Can Gap \ncontinue to recover and perhaps become a fashion brand \nleader once again?\nInside the Company\nAfter more than a decade of working in his parents’ \ncabinet-making business, Don Fisher bought a string of \nhotels and began fixing them up. To make a little extra reve-\nnue, he leased out one of the ballrooms to a salesperson to use \nas a showroom for Levi’s jeans. He observed a lot of energy \nin the ballroom, as people purchased Levi products, and \nespecially the original 501 blue jeans. Inspired by that expe-\nrience, Don, with his wife Doris, founded a store to sell blue \njeans and records. It was 1969, and Don originally wanted to \nname the company “Pants and Discs,” but the Fishers settled \non “Generation Gap.”4 Gap became the short name for The \nGaps Stores, Inc., and the company was registered. After a \nwhile, Gap introduced its own branded products and grew \nto operate retail and outlet stores worldwide specializing in \nselling casual apparel and accessories. Over the years Gap \nalso expanded to include personal care goods for women, \nmen, and children. The company eventually changed its legal \nname to Gap, Inc., by which it is known today.\nGap currently operates internationally under six lifestyle \nbrands: Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, Janie and \nJack, and Intermix. Gap’s global reach includes stores in the \nUnited States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, \nand Japan. Additionally, the company has franchised out-\nlets in Indonesia, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, \nCyprus, Jordan, and Croatia. However, Gap’s efforts to fit \nitself everywhere has caused a lot of difficulties. The company \nis planning to close all of its stores in the United Kingdom, \nIreland, France, and Italy following a strategic review of its \nEuropean business.5\nIn addition to overseas failures, Gap did not capital-\nize quickly enough on the digital e-commerce shifts that \noccurred throughout the fashion industry. It continued the \ntried-and-tested model of distributing the same product \nacross markets with little variation. Gap watched passively \nas cheaper competitors, such as H&M, Zara, and Forever 21, \ncaptured younger online shoppers with their more efficient \nsupply chains. Gap’s complacency inhibited its ability to adapt \nand innovate. For example, teenagers left the brand as they \ndid not want to be wearing the same sweatshirts that their \nmother bought them when they were ten. Once younger \nshoppers left the Gap brand, they never came back.6 In con-\ntrast, stores like Uniqlo and Target have positioned them-\nselves as the top providers of basic apparel, and brands like \nMadewell, H&M, and Zara cater to the fashion-conscious \nconsumers of the world.\nMission\nWhat started as a simple idea to make it easier to find a pair \nof jeans has developed over the years into a global mission \nfocused on positive influence on people’s everyday lives.7 The \nmission statement Gap Inc. highlights on its website is “We \nWritten by Jeffrey S.

Founders Don and Doris designed a retail experi-\nence for all by creating jeans that fit all body sizes, including \nDon’s six- foot-four-inch frame.9 Gender equality is one of \nGap’s three key values and Doris was a strong leader in this \neffort. For decades, Gap has stood for LGBTQ rights and has \nglobally advocated by supporting the United Nations Foun-\ndation Free & Equal Campaign, participating in Out & Equal, \nfundraising for World AIDs Day, and promoting local vol-\nunteerism in the community.10 From Banana Republic’s True \nHues collection, which focused on more inclusive product \nstrategies for Black and diverse consumers, to Old Navy’s \nrecent Bodequality campaign, Gap designs its products with \ninclusivity in mind.11 On its website, Gap states, “We believe \nthat when you decide that inclusion isn’t optional, not only \ndo the gaps between us close, but a whole new world of pos-\nsibilities opens.”12\nConsistent with its inclusivity focus, Gap has built and \nsustains a “culture of belonging.” This culture is dependent \non three key values that undergird its culture, operations, and \nbrand: equality and belonging, gender equality and empow-\nerment, and sustainability.13 It protects these values through \nits Human Rights Policy that celebrates the dignity and worth \nof humanity. Gap embodies these values through the myriad \nof initiatives in which it invests resources and by empowering \nits employees to lead. Not only does Gap promote this culture \nfor its employees, but it has also encouraged the creation of \nthis type of culture for its manufacturers, suppliers, distribu-\ntors, and foreign contractors. Additionally, Gap engages with \ncompetitors to ensure compliance protocols and to avoid \nconflicting expectations where suppliers are shared.\nGap continued to embody its cultural values towards \nequity and inclusion, gender empowerment, and sustain-\nability throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, \ndespite lockdown limitations, 21% of Gap’s workforce still \nfound a way to give back to their communities and advo-\ncate for hope and an end to systematic racism.14 These 24,000 \nemployees collectively volunteered more than 160,000 hours \nof their time.15 Additionally, Gap Foundation launched the \nResilience Fund for Women in Global Value Chains to sup-\nport the long-term pandemic recovery for local women-led \norganizations.16 In June 2020, Gap publicly shared its new \nEquality and Belonging Strategy through 2025 Commitments \nto Change.17 This strategy, titled Create for All, with All 2025 \nCommitments, focuses on celebrating and leveraging diver-\nsity, unlocking new opportunities, and creating an inclusive \nculture for employees, customers, and communities.18\nTo support workplace equity, Gap no longer requires \n“years of experience” on any listed job opening and no longer \nrequires educational degrees for 99.7% of jobs below the \nvice-president level. In 2021, Gap almost doubled the number \nof Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) employees \nparticipating in its Rotational Management Program com-\npared to the prior year. Gap has also partnered with inclusion \nstrategist Amber Cabral to host 29 “Real Talks” about topics \nsuch as systematic racism, microaggressions, unconscious \nbias, and held 10 “Allies & Advocates” workshop. Addition-\nally, Gap now requires mandatory racial equity training for \nemployees and has integrated inclusion and equity content \ninto its employee learning curriculum, employee life cycle, \nand its Be One. Get One. cross-cultural mentorship program.19\nTo promote education and awareness, and bridge the \ngap between education and the next generation of BIPOC \nfashion leaders, Gap partnered with Harlem’s Fashion Row \n(HFR) to provide more than $500,000 of “Closing the Gap” \nscholarships to Historically Black Colleges and Universities’ \n(HBCUs) fashion departments. Gap also sponsored HFR‘s \ninaugural Fashion Playbook, targeted at youth, middle and \nhigh school, and college level students to provide digital con-\ntent, best practices, and tips for exploring career opportuni-\nties in the fashion industry.20\nSustainability\nThe Fishers built Gap Inc. with the purpose of creating new \nopportunities for the communities where their business \noperated. Gap has continued to embrace this central value \nby creating fair conditions for its workers and by minimiz-\ning its environmental damage. Gap has aligned its sustain-\nability strategy with the United Nation’s Global Sustainable \nDevelopment Agenda. This agenda, along with the United \nNations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, \nthe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and the \nParis Agreement on Climate Change, creates a framework for \nGap to add value to the planet and society.21 From the first \nclothing design sketches to when customers clean Gap items \nfrom their personal closets, Gap sees the opportunities and \nrisks for promoting social and environment responsibility \nand sustainability.\nGap integrates sustainability deeply into the business \nmodel so as to create greater impact across the value chains.22 \nSustainability is a key priority for Gap.

For \nexample, the Color Proud Council, Gap’s product inclusion \ninitiative, was the result of its co-founder, Bahja Johnson, \napproaching President and CEO of Global Gap Brand, Mark \nBreitbard, to holistically discuss diversity at Gap and her own \npersonal experiences. As their conversation was concluding, \nBahja asked, “So what do you want to do? Should we start a \ncouncil to start to tackle what inclusion can mean for all of \nus?” Breitbard responded with, “What do I want to do? What \ndo you want to do? I will support you. I’ll put you in con-\ntact with our Head of HR and our Head of Diversity.”33 This \ntype of support from senior leadership – to listen to employ-\nees and create space for culture and product development \nshifts – is an incredible priority of Gap. The Color Proud \nCouncil has representation for all brands and functions and \nhas contributed to positive change in product improvement, \nmarket integration, Gap employee learning, talent acquisition \nand retention.\nBusiness Operations\nBusiness Model\nGap Inc. is an international retail company comprised of six \ndivisions of lifestyle brands: Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, \nAthleta, Janie and Jack, and Intermix. Each of these brand \nnames has its own target market and retail offerings that \nafforded Gap Inc. recognition as fifth in sales of apparel retail-\ners in the United States in 2020.34 Gap Inc. operates worldwide \nwith nearly 3,000 company-owned stores, over 500 franchise \nstores, as well as e-commerce sites.35 Internationally, at least \none of its brand name stores is present in North America, \nEurope, Asia, the Middle East, Oceania, South America, and \nAfrica.36\nAlthough Gap was originally founded as a means to fill \nthe “generation gap,” which was unique at the time, more \nrecently it has mostly applied what might be called a “best \nvalue” strategy to its namesake stores, providing high-quality \nproducts at reasonable (but not the lowest) prices. However, \nby spreading its businesses across different price points of \nthe retail apparel industry, the company also competes across \nmultiple target markets through its diverse apparel sectors: \nlow and medium-cost casual wear, business apparel, athletic \napparel, children’s clothes, and high-end fashion. In 2019, \nGap announced a spinoff strategy for its Old Navy brand in \norder to allow Old Navy to flourish and not be weighed down \nby lagging performance of the other brands within Gap Inc.37 \nThe plan to split into two separate publicly traded companies \nwas abruptly halted the following year as the preparation for \nthe split had “shone a bright light on operational inefficien-\ncies and areas for improvement,” according to Robert Fisher, \nson of Gap’s founders and acting interim CEO at the time.38 As \npart of its business model, Gap not only focuses on its direct \nconsumers who purchase its products, but allows consumers \nto become franchise owners. Gap also involves each of its \npartners in its shared vision through its recognition program \ncalled “Top Stitch,” which acknowledges contributions from \npartners quarterly. For each partner that shares Gap’s values\nthrough its actions, Gap donates in the partner’s honor \nto one of Gap Inc.’s non-profit partners, such as the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of America, CARE, Water.org, Good360, and \nNAACP.39\nGrowth Strategies\nIn its early years and throughout its expansion, Gap has \ncontinued to penetrate the retail apparel market with strong \nadvertising campaigns and marketing efforts focused on the \npopular fashion and social trends of the time. When Gap first \nopened in 1969, a turning point in time for the United States, its \nmission was to offer apparel – Levi’s jeans in particular – that \nappealed to multiple consumer generations. Since then, Gap \nhas intentionally continued to address the needs of diverse \nconsumers. Marketing and advertising campaigns over the \nyears have featured popular celebrities and cultural icons, such \nas Salvador Dalí, James Dean, Joan Didion, Cindy Crawford, \nSpike Lee, Whoopie Goldberg, and Madonna.40 Each of these \ncelebrity cameos have historically promoted the Gap brand; \nhowever, more recent efforts with celebrities have promoted \nother brands under the Gap Inc. umbrella. For example, Gap \nstrategically partnered with famous icons like Simone Biles \nand Sloane Stephens for its Athleta brand. Athleta’s market-\ning campaign, “Power of She,” reimagines value alignment for \nthe role of community in gender empowerment.41 On a recent \nearnings call, CEO Sonia Syngal said, “The brand’s ’All Power-\nful’ campaign saw engagement at double industry benchmarks \nand netted more than 160 million impressions across print \nand digital.”42\nAs the diversity of its stores attest, Gap has developed its \nmarket over the years primarily by entering into new market \nsegments. The Gap brand opened a GapKids store in 1986, \nexpanded into babyGap just four years later. Old Navy was \ndeveloped to fill the need for more value conscious con-\nsumers, while Hill City was a high-performance men’s life-\nstyle brand that has since closed. In 2021, the company even \nentered the home goods market through a partnership with \nWalmart. Mark Breitbard, President and CEO of Gap brand, \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Gap Home at Walmart opens a new door \nfor Gap as a lifestyle brand delivering timeless American style \nin all new ways. We are excited for this growth opportunity, \nenabling even more customers to fall in love with Gap.”43 \nAdditionally, Kanye West signed a ten-year deal with the Gap \nbrand for his Yeezy Gap line, a partnership through which \nthe Gap brand hopes to attract more younger customers. Gap \nexpects the Yeezy Gap brand will generate $1 billion of sales \nannually by 2026.44\nIn addition to a primary focus on internal growth \nthrough segment diversity, Gap has established partnerships \nwith other retailers and non-governmental organizations, \nand has collaborated with popular brands and television \nshows that capture the popular spirit of the time. Gap has \nalso acquired many companies along the way, such as Banana \nRepublic, Athleta, and Intermix, that have further diversified \nits portfolio.\nAlthough Gap’s growth strategy has been ambitious over \nthe years, it is also trimming its portfolio. In addition to \nits European withdrawal, it is closing roughly 350 Gap and \nBanana Republic stores in North America as leases expire \nin an effort to move away from malls, many of which were \nstruggling even before the COVID-19 pandemic. This strat-\negy has been deemed the\n“Power Plan 2023” and is expected to save Gap $45 mil-\nlion in rent.45 On the flipside, the Power Plan 2023 will focus \nmore heavily on boosting sales with Old Navy and Athleta \nand moving Old Navy brick-and-mortar stores to smaller \nmarkets with populations of less than 200,000. In response \nto online sales growing by 54% in 2020, Gap Inc. adapted its \nmarketing strategies to become a digital-first business.46 Its \nmarketing is personalized to the varied customers across each \nbrand. Gap uses Artificial Intelligence analysis to strengthen \nits advertisement messaging and guide data-driven decision \nmaking.47\nGlobal Supply Chain\nGap’s supply chain is comprised of thousands of global \nemployees who create high-quality products that are deliv-\nered in a timely manner. The company ships its products \nfrom supplier facilities to its distribution centers and then \non to stores or directly to customers through a combina-\ntion of sea, air, truck, and rail. Gap strongly believes that its \nproducts have a full life cycle that begins when the product \nhits the store and does not end until after it leaves the store \nand is worn by the customer.48 They are uniquely positioned \nto initiate transformative changes across the retail industry \nthrough brand collaborations and mill partnerships with \nsome of the best known vendors in retail.49\nGap consistently innovates its processes in order to \nexecute a holistic approach to improving labor standards \nand working conditions.50 Most companies in the apparel \nand fashion industry similar to Gap do not manufac-\nture their own clothing and are dependent on suppliers \nwho are often in parts of the world where the bargaining \npower of workers is weak. In an effort to safeguard the \nhealth and safety of employees in its supply chain, Gap has \nmade sure its COVID- 19 guidelines are up to date and \nenforced, especially for garment manufacturing. Gap also \npivoted its social and labor capacity building programs to \nbe offered virtually so that learning would continue during \nthe pandemic.51\nGap has built on its existing industry commitments by \nextending them to foreign contract worker requirements \nthroughout all of its Tier 2 suppliers. For example, the \nwork Gap has done with American Apparel and Footwear \nAssociation and Fair Labor Association Commitment to \nResponsible Recruitment in Taiwan has allowed workers to \nmaintain full control over their passports and travel doc-\numents and freedom of movement and full control over \nthe money they earn. All Gap Tier 1 facilities and Tier 2 \nstrategic mills participate in industrywide efforts, including \nSocial & Labor Convergence Program (SLCP) and/or Inter-\nnational Labor Organization (ILO) Better Work by 2023 and \n80% of Gap Inc. Sourcing will be allocated to green-rated \nfactories by 2025. Gap is also working with other brands, \nsuch as Adidas, Lululemon, and Patagonia, to ensure simi-\nlar compliance protocols and avoid conflicting expectations \nof shared suppliers.52\nFinancial Condition\nDuring the fiscal year ending on January 30, 2021, Gap \nsales declined from $16.4 billion in to $13.8 billion. Part \nof Gap’s response was a divestment of underperforming \nstores (see Exhibit 2) as well as pulling out of Europe. \nGiven this divestment strategy, the increase in revenue \nto $16.7 billion in the fiscal year ending in January 2022 \nis impressive. The company also turned a loss of $665 \nmillion into a gain of $256 million. Gap’s stock price fell \nduring the pandemic to  as low as $9.80. On March, 2022, \nGap was selling around $14 per share. Financial statements \nare found in Exhibits 3 and 4.\nAccording to CEO Sonia Syngal regarding the difficulty \nof getting through the COVID-19 challenges: “We faced one \nof the most difficult years in our company’s history and, \nthroughout, our teams showed resilience and determination \nas we navigated unprecedented disruption in our industry \nto set a course for long-term growth. Our powerful brands \nmoved to offense with purpose-led marketing and strength \nin relevant categories, like Active and Fleece, allowing us \nto gain meaningful market share quarter-over-quarter in a \nfragmented environment. This was enabled by our $6 billion \nonline business and advantaged digital capabilities allowing \nus to expand our reach to more than 183 million customers \nthis year.”53\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Accessed October 5, 2021.\nThe External Environment\nCompetition in the Apparel Industry\nThe fashion retail industry in which Gap operates is highly \ncompetitive and fast-paced. There are thousands of retail \nbrands that operate both brick-and-mortar stores and online \nspace, locally and globally. The barriers to entry have become \neven lower with e-commerce making it possible for virtu-\nally anyone to establish an online brand or retail presence. \nCustomers have high bargaining power when it comes to \nthe apparel and fashion industry. Switching costs for con-\nsumers are negligible. Competition is based on many factors, \nincluding quality, price, trends, and affiliation with particular \nbrands.\nAlthough Gap has a diversified portfolio of companies \nthat reach different markets and styles, competitors challenge \nGap in each of its sectors. The Gap brand and Old Navy com-\npetes with the price points of global fast-fashion brands like \nZara and H&M while Athleta faces head-on competition \nwith Lululemon, Under Armor, and Nike. Banana Republic \ncompetes with brands like J. Crew, Ann Taylor, and Everlane \nthat specialize in business apparel, as well as Zara, H&M, and \ndepartment stores.\nSocietal Forces\nIn addition to fierce competitive rivalry within the retail \ngarment industry, Gap also faces challenges due to broader \nenvironmental influences. Societal trends will always heav-\nily impact the fashion industry. The most recent movement \nthat has profoundly influenced retail companies is the “ath-\nleisure” trend, defined as “the general dressing down across \nour culture, high fashion brands turning sweats and tees into \nbig ticket items, and retailers moving more performance \napparel than ever before.”54 This trend, which arose prior to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, garnered further adoption because \nof the pandemic since many employees chose to work from \nhome in order to mitigate the spread of the disease. Many \ncompanies had already begun to become more lenient with \ndress policies and the work-from-home movement, cata-\npulted by the pandemic, will likely pave the way for this trend \nto continue to permeate into offices across the world.\nActivism with regard to diversity, equity, and inclusion is \nbeginning to show up in numerous companies’ vision state-\nments and efforts to promote it throughout all aspects of \nthese companies’ operations are growing. Gap has positioned \nitself at the forefront of this effort with its longstanding, clear \nvalues and bold marketing campaigns and messages. Gap has \nnot, however, been perfect in its responses to this trend. For \nexample, following the 2020 presidential election, in an effort \nto promote post-election unity, Gap tweeted an image of a \nred and blue hoodie with a headline that read, “The one thing \nwe know, is that together, we can move forward.” It immedi-\nately received backlash for being patronizing and tone-deaf at \na time when political tension was high.55\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

As the \neconomy began to open back up, consumers were still hesi-\ntant to shop indoors and spending habits shifted. Consumers’ \npersonal savings rates increased and there was less in-per-\nson activity which decreased consumers’ retail spending. The \nretail industry also faced a decrease in employment that is \nonly now starting to rise. As a result, many retailers closed \nstorefronts and are making efforts to reduce store count as \nonline shopping continues to grow.\nA growing concern for retailers in Gap’s mainstay US \nmarket is inflation. As the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rises, \nconsumers are likely to become more value-conscious. As a \nresult, retailers are likely to face an even stronger price-driven \npromotional cycle of discounting, making it increasingly dif-\nficult to transition to a path that fosters growth and profit-\nability. Consumers will likely increase online shopping in an \neffort to avoid spending on gas or to find better prices.56\nWith global operations, Gap is required to comply with \nvarious domestic, regional, and international laws, such as \ndiscrimination law, antitrust law, occupation law, health and \nsafety law. The laws can directly or indirectly impact not only \nhow the company operates, but also its operational costs. Gap \nputs an emphasis on comprehensive corporate compliance to \nensure its employees and management meet legal require-\nments around the world and operate responsibly with integ-\nrity in everything they do.

As leader \nof Haier’s Internet of Food (IoF) sub-field, he oversaw the \ncore business of kitchen appliances as well as products and \nservices related to food and cooking. Since adopting a new \nstrategy in 2019, Haier’s business revolved around providing \n“smart home solutions”.\nWu had joined Haier in 2001 as an intern after graduating \nfrom Tianjin Business School, starting out at the refrigera-\ntor factory in Qingdao, where he ultimately became director. \nFrom 2009 to 2014 he had worked internationally, managing \ntwo of Haier’s acquisitions in Southeast Asia and Japan. In \n2015, Wu returned to headquarters in Qingdao to focus on \ndelivering “smart” products and solutions in the refrigerator, \nfood and cooking space. He was made responsible for creat-\ning a platform focused on delivering novel ‘food and kitchen \nexperiences’ to users. This involved encouraging an ‘entre-\npreneurial’ approach among the people working in the sub-\nfield. In four years, Wu had turned it into an ecosystem with \nmore than 1,000 partners covering 12 sectors including food, \ncooking, home decoration, supermarkets & retail, maternal \n& infant, and beverages. He was also tasked with providing \nfeedback on how the recent evolution of Haier’s organizing \nmodel and its ecosystem micro- communities (EMCs) could \nbe better aligned with company strategy.\nAs he prepared for the strategy meeting, he wondered \nwhether any changes needed to be made to the organizing \nmodel to continue building on the IoF’s recent success.\nHaier Group History\nThe Haier Group (Haier) is a China-based manufacturer of \nlarge and small household appliances and consumer elec-\ntronics, founded in 1984 with collective ownership. By the \nlate 1990s, the Chinese market was increasingly sophisti-\ncated, prompting a number of foreign refrigerator brands \nto enter the market. For Haier, the only way to survive was \nto focus on producing high-quality products and excellent \ncustomer service. Its initial success in growing the refriger-\nator business led to a government request that the company \ntake control of failing companies. As a result, it acquired a \nstring of local firms that covered nearly the entire range of \nhome appliances.\nBy 2020, Haier had about 80,000 employees worldwide as \nwell as a network of external partners who jointly developed \nand delivered co-branded products and services through  \nHaier’s distribution channels. Its seven brands–Haier, \nCasarte, Leader, Aqua, Fisher & Paykel, GE Appliances, and \nCANDY–were present in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Americas, \nthe Middle East and Africa. The Haier Group traded on the \nstock exchanges of Shanghai (A shares), Frankfurt (D shares) \nand Hong Kong (H shares) through its principal subsid-\niary, Haier Smart Home Co., Ltd., which in 2020 reported \noperating revenues of 209.7 billion RMB ($32 billion) \nand net profits of 8.9 billion RMB ($1.4 billion). In 2020, \noverseas operations represented 48% of total revenue (see \nExhibit 1). In the ten years prior, gross profits in Haier’s core \nappliance business grew 22 percent per year and revenues \ngrew 20 percent per year.1\nThe Consumer Market and the Rise of \nSmart Products and Services\nAs Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon transformed \nindustries–including entertainment, cloud computing, adver-\ntisement, retail and logistics–by leveraging and building on \ntheir core products and services, it became increasingly clear \nthat the competitive landscape for consumer goods was no \nlonger confined to a company’s own industry or market \nsegment. Instead, Haier believed that the leading firms of \nthe future would be companies that created an ecosystem \naround their products to deliver an integrated user experi-\nence. From the iPhone and the Apple Watch to Google Nest \nand Amazon Echo, the most successful products were per-\nsonalized to users’ changing needs and offered much more \nthan a single function. They were linked to other products \n03/2022-6724\nThis case study was written by Professor Michael Y. Lee, Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour, Professor Wesley Wu-Yi Koo, Assistant Professor of Strategy, \nboth at INSEAD, and Joost Minnaar, Co-Founder of Corporate Rebels.

Seamless connections \nbetween software and hardware gave rise to previously \nunimaginable levels of flexibility and adaptability that \nthreatened to disrupt established firms across multiple \nindustries.\nDespite rising demand for smart solutions, however, \nsmart products had proven hard to develop and manufacture. \nThey often required participation by external partners, and \ncollaboration between these disparate stakeholders was diffi-\ncult as most ecosystems could not be governed hierarchically. \nFor example, when Amazon first marketed Kindle e-readers \nin 2007, it faced resistance from publishers. To overcome the \nresistance, not only did Amazon provide financial subsidies \nand incentives, it also developed a novel security feature to \nensure that e-books on the Kindle could not be easily dupli-\ncated and shared, allaying publisher concerns about intellec-\ntual property theft.2\nPursuing an Ecosystem Brand \nStrategy at Haier\nFrom 2014, top managers at Haier saw the potential for an \n“ecosystem brand” strategy in the home appliances business. \nAs Yong Wu put it:\n“As early as 2014, Haier started to think about transform-\ning the traditional home appliances business into an eco-\nsystem or platform. In 2015, we saw the phenomenon of \nsmartphones and other smart appliances, and the direc-\ntion of IoT and mobile internet was clear… Because IoT \nis about the connections between one appliance and other \nthings, we started to explore what can form the basis of \nconnection between home appliances.”\nZhang Ruimin, chairman of the board and CEO of Haier \nGroup, proposed to turn Haier’s electrical appliances into \nnetworked devices that created “smart home solutions” cen-\ntered around the needs of users. Employees were encouraged \nto integrate the internet and IoT into every product that Haier \nmade. Over the next few years, the company recruited more \nExhibit 1 Haier Smart Home’s Key Accounting and Financial Data 2020\nSource: 2020 Annual Report of Haier Smart Home Co., Ltd\nVII.

This \nbusiness was built on over forty thousand internet-connected \nwashing machines across a thousand Chinese college cam-\npuses. Students could schedule and pay for the machines via \na smart phone app. Haier built a platform that connected the \n10 million users of the app with other relevant businesses, \nsuch as food delivery companies and dorm room furniture \nsellers. Haier took a share of revenues for every purchase on \nthe platform.3\nIn October 2020, Haier unveiled a new brand called \nthe “Three-winged bird” that sought to capture all of the \ncompany’s smart product ecosystems under a single brand \numbrella. These included, for example, smart products to \npersonalize and synchronize the working of appliances to \nspecific user behaviors, such as taking a nap. In this case, \nthe user’s voice activated three appliances–the electric cur-\ntain, the air conditioner and the humidifier– to create an \nenvironment conducive for napping (by raising the room \ntemperature, closing the curtain, and increasing ambient \nhumidity). The appliances also interacted and adjusted to \neach other in unison: the air conditioner and the humidifier \nadjusted their power levels depending on whether the cur-\ntains were closed or open. In addition to hardware devices \nworking in concert, Haier’s vision was to integrate other \napplications and e-commerce storefronts: imagine a smart \nmirror that could show and recommend new outfits and \ndirect customers to clothing retailers’ websites where they \ncould purchase the items with one click.\nIn the first three quarters of 2020, Haier sold 687,000 \nsmart home solutions, each consisting of multiple connected \nhome appliances, other products and services, for a total of \n7.2 billion RMB (1.11 billion USD in 2020), representing 25% \nyear-over-year growth.\nHistory of Rendanheyi: Haier’s Unique \nOrganizing Model\nAs of 2005, Haier’s organizing model, rendanheyi (meaning \n“what is valued most by the customer is compensated best”) \nwas guided by the principle of “human value maximization”. \nThis involved motivating all employees “to be their own \nCEO”, to aim for “zero distance to users”, and to create an \nExhibit 2  Illustration of the Three-Winged Bird “scenario brand”\nSource: Haier Group\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Although the \nprinciple had been consistently  applied over the previous two \ndecades, how it was manifested had evolved enormously.\n2005-13 Market chain & ZZJYTs\nInspired by Michael Porter’s value-chain concept, the first iter-\nation of rendanheyi organized the business into “market chains” \nof strategic business units. Within a given market chain, goods \nand services were traded and transacted as if on the open \nmarket. The goal was to bring more entrepreneurial energy \nand market-based dynamics into the organization.\nAs a result of tensions that arose with turning collaboration \ninto internal transactions and the desire that more teams be \nmarket-facing, there was a move towards a team-based struc-\nture, called Zi Zhu Jing Ying Ti (meaning “independent oper-\nating units”) or ZZJYT. The 2,000+ ZZJYT units were orga-\nnized into three tiers. Tier-1 consisted of marketing, product \nand manufacturing units performing core activities. Tier-2 \ndelivered support services such as logistics, HR, IT, R&D \nand finance, and were intended to support Tier-1. Tier-3 \nprovided the other ZZJYT units with strategic direction.\nZZJYT units were given the power to make their own \ndecisions, essentially operating as mini start-ups. This rad-\nical change attracted employees who could sense entrepre-\nneurial opportunity. In addition, it created an internal labor \nmarket where individuals bid for work from various ZZJYT \nunits, mimicking the external labor market. As part of this \nchange, 12,000 middle management jobs were eliminated–\nthose managers either had to find a new role or leave.\nHowever, after experimenting with variations of ZZJYT \nunits, it became apparent that the Tier-1 units lacked the \ndecision power to allocate the technical and financial \nresources to bring new products and services to market, and \nthat the incentives were too weak to promote the type of \nentrepreneurial activity and risk taking envisioned.\n2013-19 Platforms & MEs\nTo resolve weaknesses in the ZZJYT model, Haier restruc-\ntured its 2,000 ZZJYT units into 4,000 micro-enterprises \n(MEs). There were 200 “user MEs” that were in direct con-\ntact with end-customers, and 3,800 “node MEs” that provided \nthe user MEs with services and products via a competitive \ninternal market system.\nEach ME—both user and node MEs —comprised ten \nto fifteen employees and operated like a stand-alone enter-\nprise, with its own balance sheet, own P&L, and lifespan (an \nME could cease to exist if it underperformed for a pro-\nlonged period). It had the authority to develop and market \ntheir products and services–to be paid for by other (node) \nMEs or by end users. MEs could decide which other MEs to \ncollaborate with, which staff to hire, and how to distribute \nrewards and set compensation. User MEs were free to pro-\ncure resources from external partners when they felt that \ninternal (node) MEs could not meet their needs.\nThe shift to MEs turned Haier into a network of loosely \nconnected autonomous units, each with the authority to \nact in its own interest, reproducing the competitive dynam-\nics of a marketplace. They were grouped by market segment \ninto 20 or so platforms, whose role was to incubate new MEs, \nprovide the necessary resources, create a system of internal \ncontracting between MEs, establish “presets” or rules of \nengagement, and diffuse best practices.\nThis internal contracting system was not without ten-\nsions, as each ME’s income was based on the performance \nof the unit - not the performance of the MEs they collabo-\nrated with, nor the larger platform they were part of. This \nincentivized MEs to focus on their own profits and perfor-\nmance even when it came at the expense of the company \nas a whole.\nThe tensions became more apparent when Haier saw \na shift in customer demand towards “smart” products \nand services. MEs were encouraged to evolve their busi-\nness model from selling standalone hardware products to \none-time customers to building ecosystems around smart \nproducts and services that could generate recurring reve-\nnues from engaged, active users. The development of smart \nproducts and services required new levels of collaboration \namongst MEs that had become accustomed to operating \nindependently. To accommodate this new strategic focus, \nHaier again adapted its organizing model.\nEvolving Rendanheyi to Deliver Smart \nEcosystem Brands: Ecosystem Micro-\nCommunities (EMC)\nInitiated in 2019, the next evolution of the rendanheyi \nmodel was designed to facilitate Haier’s transition from a \ntraditional appliance manufacturer to an ecosystem that \ndelivered smart products and services. To accomplish this, \nHaier introduced ecosystem micro-communities, or EMCs. \nWhereas platforms in the previous iteration of rendanheyi \nwere collections of MEs grouped according to common \nproduct lines without any integration between them, EMCs \nwere coordinated networks of MEs and external partners \nthat worked collaboratively. Haier’s new organization struc-\nture was built around EMCs that grouped into sub-fields, \nthen ecosystems (see Exhibit 3).\nEMC Case Study: The Peking Roast Duck \nProject\nAn early example of an EMC was the Smart Cooking EMC \nand its Peking Roast Duck Project. The leader, Yu Zhang, had \nworked for Haier for over 10 years before he took the reins of \nthe Smart Cooking EMC: three years as a sales representative, \nfive years working on Haier’s high- end brand Casarte, then \ntwo years launching the similarly named Smart Kitchen ME. \nAs ME leader, Zhang’s vision was sparked by the nationwide \nlockdown in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic \nwhen restaurants shut down. In the same way that many \nhigh-quality restaurants purchased “semi-finished” dishes \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Their \nfirst product, Peking Roast Duck, was one of China’s most \nfamous dishes and consisted of slices of tender roast duck \nwith crispy skin inside a thin crepe, with hoisin sauce, \ngreen onions and other condiments. Historical evidence \nof Peking Duck goes back to the Southern and Northern \ndynasties (420-589 AD), and it was first recorded at the \nimperial court during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) in the \nform of a recipe written by a royal physician which called \nfor intricate preparation, including roasting the duck \ninside a sheep’s stomach. By the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) \nit was consumed by the nobility and praised by scholars \nand poets.\nIt is made from white ducks raised in a free-range envi-\nronment for 45 days, force-fed for 15 to 20 days to fatten \nthem, then slaughtered and boiled. To enable the skin to \ncrisp during the roasting process, air is pumped under the \nducks’ skin so that it separates from the fat. The ducks are \nthen hung to dry and coated with maltose syrup to further \nenhance the crispiness of the skin, then roasted in either a \ntraditional closed oven or smoked over a wood fire.\nGiven its complex preparation, Peking Roast Duck \nwas viewed in China as a dish only for special occasions \nand meant going out to a fancy restaurant. Mingkai Yu, a \nmember of the Smart Cooking EMC explained,\nAll Chinese people think ‘If we want to eat Peking Duck \nwe need to go to some famous restaurant.’ Even for elderly \npeople, though it may be difficult for them to move from \none place to another, they have to go [to the restaurant], \nbecause if you take home Peking Duck the taste of it will \nchange.\nPeking Duck was a powerful symbol of what the EMC \nhoped to achieve: a way for ordinary people to cook restau-\nrant-quality dishes at home. If they could enable this, they \ncould carve out a niche in the market. The complexity of the \nrecipe, however, presented several challenges. For example, \nthey had to identify a partner to source the specialty ducks, \ncalled tián yā, which are raised on only a few farms in China. \nSpecial packaging was needed to ensure the ducks were still \nfresh after transportation and storage. Once delivered to the \ncustomer’s home, ducks had to be stored at a precise tempera-\nture to maintain freshness. They needed chefs to provide the \nrecipe for preparing the duck, and customers required a pro-\ngrammable oven so the ducks could be roasted at the touch of \na button (see Exhibit 4). Mingkai Yu explained the different \npartners with which EMC had to collaborate:\nThe challenge is because we need to design the whole \nprocess from the ducks, the farms, the factories, and the \ncook’s recipes to the IoT appliances and the cooking …\nWe knew we could not do it alone because Peking Duck is \na very complex dish and it involves a lot of special exper-\ntise. Therefore we need to work together with different \nteams. Inside Haier we can find MEs who are doing \novens or kitchen appliances or some MEs specialized in \nelectronic control ... I’m in charge of IoT appliances and \ncan do this part. But beside these parts, we still need to \nwork together with external partners. For example, we \noutsourced the packaging work to a Chengdu-based \ncompany, and we also reached out to some professional \ncooks who worked in Beijing to cook Peking Duck … \nAmong the cooks there is the ninth successor of the \nRestaurant, Quanjude, which is the most famous Peking \nDuck restaurant in China.\nTo coordinate activity across the various partner nodes \n(both internal and external), Zhang utilized an “EMC con-\ntract” that specified what was to be delivered by the partner, \nby when, and what the compensation or profit-sharing \narrangement would be:\nFor example, 10% of the profits will go to the cooks who \nsell the recipe to us … For the farms who sell ducks to us …  \nbefore they were B2B, now they need to change to B2C, \nthey need special packaging for home use, etc, and we \nalso will negotiate a percentage of profit sharing with \nthem, for example another 10% or 20% . I won’t go into \ndetails on this because it’s kind of a business secret. But \nat the end of the day, we can get 50 Renminbi by selling \none duck,. We will use 30% of the profit for profit sharing \namong all internal MEs of Haier … the other 70% of the \nprofit will go to the sub-field or go to the whole company, \nExhibit 3  Conceptual Representation of Haier’s Organizational Structure\nSources: A.

But next month, maybe you don’t do a lot of \nwork and your share will decrease.”\nVery little start-up capital was needed for the EMC. Part-\nners were not guaranteed compensation. Incentives were \nbased purely on the potential for future profits. Based on \nthe initial assessment of the market opportunity and team \ncapacity, Zhang’s EMC was awarded several hundred thou-\nsand RMB of “value-added sharing space”, basically a guaran-\nteed profit- sharing pool if the EMC met its initial volume \nand revenue targets. The size of the pool attracted other MEs \nto bid for the goals set by Zhang. Ultimately, Zhang’s EMC \ncontracted with 11 nodes (internal and external) to help \ndevelop the product, including the Steaming Oven ME, the \nFood Materials ME, the Internet of Things Payment Scenario \nInteraction ME, the Finance ME, the Human Resources ME, \nand the User Interaction ME. In addition, 42 regional mar-\nketing centers joined the EMC.\nThe Smart Cooking EMC launched the Peking Roast \nDuck product—an integrated experience combining the \npackaged duck, smart oven, and phone app–for market \ntesting in October 2020, a few months after conceiving the \nidea (see Exhibit 5). After tweaking the offering based on \nuser feedback, they launched on the Haier Smart Home \napp. Samples were sent to more than 3,000 Haier stores \nfor sale. In the first month, they sold 20,000 ducks and \ngenerated revenues of several million RMB, twice the orig-\ninal target. Chef Zhang Weili, who led the development of \nthe recipe, cooking process and instructions earned several \nthousand RMB from profit sharing in the initial months \nafter launch.\nEven as the Smart Cooking EMC was launching the \nPeking Duck product, they were already reaching out to \nexternal investors, planning to spin off the EMC as an \nindependent company - a process called “upgrading”. \nFor the EMC, it enabled access to outside capital and \nthe potential for higher payouts. For Haier, it helped \nensure strategic alignment by spinning off entities that \nwere not core to its strategy while still sharing in their \nupside growth potential. Zhang explained:\nNow, we are trying to establish an independent legal \nentity, and yes there is a committee inside Haier to make \ndecisions in making investments. We will also attract \nsome external VCs to invest in our MEs, and Haier will \nalso make investments. Haier will establish a panel or \na committee composed of our H.R. departments, legal \ndepartment, financial department, and the strategy \ndepartment and I will do a roadshow to the committee \nas the founder of the company\nIn the future our business will focus on selling dishes \nor selling a solution, how to cook a dish including the \nsemi-finished products and the ingredients–all of these \nthings … And this is not the main business of Haier \nGroup, so we will become an independent legal entity \nseparate from Haier …You can deem it as kind of an IPO, \nand Haier will be my shareholder. I won’t be affiliated \nto Haier; we will become kind of a relationship between \nshareholders.\nExhibit 4  Example of a Peking Duck oven\nSource: Haier Group\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In November \n2020, Zhang mortgaged his house and then invested over  \n1 million RMB (154k USD) in the new company. Together \nwith 10 other EMC members they invested a total of over  \n2 million RMB (324k USD) in their own start-up.\nThereafter, the Smart Cooking EMC expanded its offer-\nings by developing 16 new dishes with regional characteris-\ntics from around China, such as Beijing, Shandong, Fujian, \nGuangdong, and Sichuan.\nEMCs as connectors of nodes\nAs illustrated by the example of the Smart Cooking EMC, \nEMCs were temporary structures that connected various \ninternal MEs as well as external partners. They enabled \nHaier to bring various stakeholders together quickly and \nflexibly to collaborate on a new product or service. In con-\ntrast to MEs which were relatively stable, EMCs were highly \ndynamic. One EMC leader in the IoF sub-field explained:\nI think of EMCs as more like a connector, and MEs as \nmore likely to meet a single demand or to have a single \nfunction. For example, any small team inside Haier can \nbe an ME. An ME has a single function to meet, a single \nneed from the user or from anybody inside Haier. But \nan EMC is kind of a connector. For example, my EMC \nconnects over 20 nodes, they are 20 MEs, and we connect \nindirectly to 60 nodes and even more MEs, so this way \nwe are a connector or coordinator of different resources.\nAn EMC could be created in a planned manner or \nmore organically. For example, the IoF sub- field of which \nthe Smart Cooking EMC was a part had seven different \nExhibit 5 Example of Marketing Material for Haier’s Peking Duck Project\nSource: Haier Group\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Five were initiated in a planned fashion. Other EMCs \nemerged more organically in response to customer feedback \nand as the vision evolved in response to new data. An EMC \nleader in the IoF sub- field, Hang Sun, recalled the origin and \nevolution of the seven EMCs:\n[A]t the beginning we studied people’s behavior related \nto a kitchen. No matter if you are poor or rich, healthy or \nnot healthy, if you have a kitchen you must carry out the \nfollowing actions: eating, buying food, storage, cooking, \nwashing. And so these are the five EMCs we created or \ndesigned in a planned manner.\nRegarding the EMC of Kitchen Renovation and the \nMother and Infant, these two EMCs were created in an \nemerging manner. Another example which is a mixture of \nboth methods, is the EMC of Smart Cooking. Originally \nwe wanted to develop it into an educational platform \nwhere we could do some offline or offsite education and \nteach you how to cook a dish. However, we received a lot \nof opinions and feedback from our colleagues, and, even-\ntually, we made it an EMC to help customers fully accom-\nplish the task of making dishes from semi-finished food.\nLike the Smart Cooking EMC, which addressed the \nproblem of making restaurant quality dishes at home, each \nof these EMCs aimed to build solutions that were complex \nand required integration across a variety of internal and \nexternal partners. For example, the EMC for Kitchen Ren-\novation sought to address the widespread problem of small, \nantiquated kitchens by creating a service that would allow \nhouseholds to renovate and modernize their kitchen in three \ndays. The ambitious vision required Haier to martial exper-\ntise both across Haier and outside the company.\nProcess of Creating an EMC and Attracting \nBids to Participate\nTo create an EMC, formal evaluation and approval were \nrequired. Anybody could propose an EMC by submitting \nthe long-term vision, an estimate of the resources required \nand the potential profit to an internal committee called \nthe Great Shared Platform that comprised members of HR, \nlegal, finance and others. Upon approval, the EMC was \nformally registered on Haier’s internal digital platform, the \n“Workbench” (see Exhibit 6).\nOnce registered, an EMC could start to attract resources \nand partners to achieve its vision by sharing its goals via the \nWorkbench that others in the company competed for and bade \non. Setting the right goals was an important and non-trivial \npart of the exercise. They needed to be specific enough so \nthat the EMC leader and the Great Shared Platform could \nevaluate competing bidders, as Yu Zhang explained:\nI think the leader of an EMC is very important. Not every-\nbody can be the leader of an EMC … Our work is kind \nof art. We need to make a specific reasonable achievable \ngoal, which can also separate or select the best solution \nprovider. For example, I cannot tell all of my MEs, “Who \ncan design a machine which can make dumplings?” ... \nThe oven producer can tell me ‘I can do this and my \ncost is 10,000 Renminbi,’ and the manufacturer of a pen \ncan also tell me ‘I can also do this and my cost is only \n500 Renminbi,’ so how can I decide? I need to make the \ndemand or the need very specific so that I can select the \nbest one.\nAny individual or ME could bid on goals on the Work-\nbench. To attract bidders, the vision and profit potential of \nthe opportunity needed to be compelling. If an EMC strug-\ngled to attract bidders, it might indicate that the goal was \nunreasonable, the broader vision needed to be revisited, or \nthat the EMC needed to look for external partners.\nThe bidding process was open to all. Senior leaders could \nalso bid for roles in EMCs working alongside individuals \nwho were junior to them. For instance, Hang Sun bid on \ngoals from other EMCs. He explained:\nI also compete for the goals created by other EMCs or \nthe EMCs under the framework of IoF. For example, \nsometimes an EMC will create a goal regarding R&D, \nregarding operations, regarding marketing or regarding \nsome other views, and sometimes I take part in these \nEMC goals competing for a role in these opportunities. \nBecause we don’t have a bureaucratic system in Haier \nand … I think everybody who is able should take part \nin their role. In this way, I also want to take part in \nother EMC contacts so I can also share the profits in \nthe future.\nSun acknowledged that sometimes individuals he worked \nwith in an operating role in an EMC might view him as the \nboss. He explained:\nIn my EMC all the people are of the same age and some \nof them are younger than me. Some of them were born \nin the 1990s and Chinese people born in the 1990s are \nvery active in their mind. I never try to overrule them,  \nExhibit 6 Procedures to Initiate an EMC Contract\nSource: Based on internal company documents and interviews\nFill in project\nname and\ntype\nIdentify target\ncustomers\nDefne project\ntargets/goals\nBegin review\nprocess\nIndicate\namount of\nself- investment\nEstimate\nproject costs\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

I always \nencourage discussion. And yes, there are some people \nwho defer to me or think I’m the boss and they need to \nfollow my instructions or my orders, but normally those \nare newcomers. As they spend more time here, they will \nknow that they can talk very openly with me.\nEMCs were able to quickly form and disband. Most \nEMCs had very few full-time employees dedicated exclu-\nsively to the work of the EMC. Most individuals working \non a given EMC were also members of established MEs that \npaid their base salary. Compensation for EMC-related work \ntypically came in the form of claims on future profits. Product \ndevelopment cycles were very short–many took just weeks or \nmonths from concept to launch. If EMCs were not successful \nin the market, workers lost interest and the EMCs disbanded.\nThe EMC Contract\nThe EMC contract was the key coordinating mechanism \nbetween EMC partners. In addition to specifying respon-\nsibilities, deadlines and profit-sharing arrangements, it was \nupdated according to work needs. EMC contracts, including \nthe profit-sharing percentages, were built on blockchain tech-\nnology and were transparent to everyone in the EMC via the \nWorkbench. A member of the Smart Cooking EMC explained:\nMr. Zhang [the leader of the Smart Cooking EMC] has a \nrequirement for all the MEs, for example, that by the end \nof next month we need to finish the programming of a \nrecipe in a new device, a new oven. Mr. Lee applied and he \ngot this task, so he needs to upload this task to his dash-\nboard in the Workbench so that everybody can see that \nhe has this responsibility. They will sign an EMC contract \n(Mr. Lee and Mr. Zhang) ... that by the end of next month \nyou need to finish the programming of this new recipe \nin this new device. If you make it correctly, you can get a \nshare of the profits, and if not you cannot get this profit. So \neverything will go following the contents of this contract.\nThe goals, targets, and compensation arrangements of \neach EMC contract were decided by the EMC leader and \nthe Great Shared Platform but were the result of discussion \nbetween the EMC leader, other staff members, and the \npartners. The EMC leader needed to continually manage \nand negotiate with partner nodes to ensure that people were \naligned and felt fairly compensated. This required the ability \nto effectively communicate the “why” behind profit sharing \npercentages. Yong Wu explained:\nThe discussion process is very open and public and fair, \nand we adjust the profit- sharing mechanism once a \nmonth. For example, this month if you’re not very happy \nwith your share, you just tell me and the next month, if \nI think it is unfair for you, maybe I will compensate you \nwith another bonus or another profit. So up to now I \nhaven’t had any problems with the profit sharing making \nanybody not very happy.\nIn addition, partners contracting with an EMC could \ncontract with other MEs inside Haier to support the comple-\ntion of their contracted work. For example, the Smart Cook-\ning EMC contracted with the Smart Kitchen ME (focused \non transforming traditional home appliances into networked \nappliances) to deliver a camera inside the oven that could \ndetermine when a food item was cooked. To facilitate this, \nthe ME worked with a separate Artificial Intelligence ME \ninside Haier to help with the image-processing capabilities \nneeded to accomplish this goal.\nEMC contracts were also used with external partners. \nFor example, with the Peking Roast Duck project, the EMC \nneeded to contract with duck farms, specifying the volume \nof ducks, the packaging needed, and the share of profits.\nTo negotiate, establish, enforce, and periodically update \ncontracts between the different partners in an EMC required \ncommunication and coordination. This meant a lot of meet-\nings. A member of the Smart Cooking EMC, Tang Ying, \ndescribed a typical working day:\nIn the morning we will identify all the projects we need to \ndrive for the day and what are the departments or teams \ninvolved and what the gaps are, and what kind of support \nwe need, resources we need to drive these projects for-\nward, and there’s a lot of communication, a lot of meet-\nings going on. And at the end of the day we will look at \nthe progress we have made and the problems we still have \nand what are the things that we need to communicate \nwith other departments, so there’s a lot of meetings and \ncommunication going on during the day.\nLooking Ahead\nAs Yong Wu surveyed the landscape, he was convinced that \nHaier’s strategy of pursuing an ecosystem brand strategy was \nthe right one. Early returns on the most recent evolution of \nthe rendanheyi model–and the EMC structure–were positive \nand indicated that it was enabling the type of complex col-\nlaborations needed to deliver smart products and services. \nHowever, like earlier shifts in the rendanheyi model, the EMC \nmodel was not without its own challenges. One was how to \nharness the market-based entrepreneurial forces at the root \nof the model to align with the company’s direction. While \nindividuals and MEs had decision- making authority and the \nautonomy to pursue any entrepreneurial opportunities they \njudged valuable, these had to be sufficiently coordinated with \nthe strategic direction of the broader organization. Yong Wu \nexplained:\n[At the level of the leadership of the company] we need \nto make sure that MEs can compete, but the direction \nthey are competing must align with the strategic direction \nof the company, for example to develop home appliance \nsolutions instead of competing towards other goals.\nCompetition between MEs for various EMC goals could \nonly exist when there were multiple buyers and sellers in \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

How to allow for enough but not too \nmuch slack was an ongoing concern. Yong Wu described the \ndelicate balancing act:\nAs leaders in Haier we also consider how to make sure \nthat MEs are not doing the same thing, because ... that \nmeans there’s a waste of time and input. For example, \nmaybe only one solution will be used and other solutions \nwon’t be used–this will be a waste.\nHaier generally relied on market forces to strike this bal-\nance. If an ME was not able to deliver competitive products \nor services to the EMC it was eventually phased out. But \nsome wondered whether Haier should have greater oversight \nto shape the composition of the ME portfolio and ensure \nalignment between EMCs and corporate strategy. Central-\nized oversight was applied only at the formation stage of \nthe EMC, which had to be approved by the Great Shared \nPlatform, but should Haier include additional touchpoints, \nperhaps through an annual strategic review process? To \nmanage slack resources, should Haier more actively mon-\nitor the performance of MEs and take the initiative to phase \nout the low-performing ones and spur new ones where there \nwas greater demand and greater fit with the overall portfolio \nof MEs at Haier?\nThe rendanheyi model relied on the entrepreneurial \nbehavior and capabilities of individuals to be successful. \nFor those with big dreams and entrepreneurial drive, Hai-\ner’s system presented an abundance of opportunities, but \nnot everyone was cut out for it. Yu Zhang reflected on how \nHaier’s system was good for some but not others.\nI think now Haier has such a good platform to encour-\nage everybody to create their own business to be an \nentrepreneur of their start-up. It’s a very good opportu-\nnity for me, it can help me realize my dream. But I think \nthis mechanism is kind of a double- edged sword. If you \nare a passive person, you don’t want to start your business, \nmaybe you will be phased out of this mechanism quickly. \nBut if you have a big dream and you are an entrepreneur, \nHaier’s system can help you grow up rapidly.\nThe compensation structure at Haier provided low base \npay, equivalent to the minimum wage of the province in \nwhich the company was based. To supplement this, Haier \nprovided upside potential through numerous profit-sharing \nmechanisms. Individuals could receive high financial rewards \nfor their efforts, but this was dependent on the performance \nof the MEs and EMCs of which they were a part. On aver-\nage, about 40% of an employee’s pay came from guaranteed \nwages, while 60% came from profit sharing. In addition, Hai-\ner’s entrepreneurial system promoted a culture of high moti-\nvation and intense work demands. Acting as an entrepreneur \nentailed high workloads and work intensity, and could be \noverwhelming for some.\nHow to strike the right balance between unleashing the \nentrepreneurial drive and risk taking of its employees and \nproviding sufficient predictable income for all its employees? \nWhat percent of an average employee’s compensation should \nbe guaranteed? It was 40% now, but should it be higher? \nWhat would be the trade-offs of doing so?\nAs Yong Wu considered these questions, he realized \nthat Haier had to remain vigilant and continue to adapt its \norganizing model to fit an evolving strategy and emergent \ntensions. He wondered what recommendations to make \nin the group strategy meeting on how to adapt and refine \nthe model in light of the questions and tensions he had \nobserved.\nNotes\n1.

Hershey \nranked fourth-to-last behind Mars Incorporated (Mars), \nNestlé SA, and Lindt & Sprüngli AG on Green America’s 2019 \nChocolate Company Scorecard (see Exhibit 1).9 Although \nHershey’s quest was “to bring goodness to the world,”10 \nthe company had broken its 2001 pledge to eradicate “the \nworst forms of child labour” and “uproot child labor from \nits cocoa supply chain,” according to a 2019 article in The \nWashington Post.11\nChild labour was considered a global human rights chal-\nlenge affecting 152 million children. The United Nations had \nset a Sustainable Development Goal (goal 8.7) to eradicate \nchild labour “in all its forms” by 2025.12 Pressure for greater \nsupply-chain transparency and compliance with human \nrights had also increased in Europe and the United States in \n2020 when with the Slave-Free Business Certification Act was \nintroduced to US Congress.13 If passed, companies in viola-\ntion of the Act could be liable for $500 million in punitive \ndamages.14 In addition, on February 12, 2021, Hershey became \none of seven defendants in an unprecedented US federal \nclass-action lawsuit filed by International Rights Advocates \non behalf of eight Malians “trafficked as children and forced \nto harvest cocoa in Côte d’Ivoire.”15\nAn annual shareholders’ meeting was set for May 17, \n2021,16 and Buck had to decide how to address these chal-\nlenges since they pertained to the company’s reputation, its \ncore business model, and its corporate social responsibility.\nCompany Origins\nThe origins of Hershey dated back to the 1880s, when Milton \nS. Hershey founded the Lancaster Caramel Company in \nLancaster, Pennsylvania (PA), United States. Inspired by the \nGerman chocolate-making machines featured at the 1893 \nWorld’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Milton decided to \nenter the chocolate business the following year and founded \nthe Hershey Company. By 1900, the chocolate business was \ndoing so well that Milton sold his caramel company to focus \non the mass manufacture of chocolate bars, building a plant \nin 1903 in Derry Township, PA (later renamed Hershey, PA), \nwhich became the largest chocolate manufacturing facility in \nthe world at that time. Under his leadership, several innova-\ntive products were marketed, including Kisses (1907); Milk \nChocolate with Almonds (1908); Mr. Goodbar, made with \npeanuts (1925); Krackel, made with crisped rice (1938); and \nField Ration D, an emergency nutrition bar, which did not \nmelt in tropical heat, to support the efforts of World War II.17\nFollowing the war and Milton’s death, the company grew \nthrough strategic acquisitions. For example, it acquired the \nmanufacturer of Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and two pasta \ncompanies in the 1960s. Strategic acquisitions continued \nthroughout the 1980s, including the purchase of the American \noperations of Cadbury Schweppes, which made Hershey \nthe US manufacturer of Cadbury and Peter Paul products. \nIts diversification into the non-chocolate business also con-\ntinued, albeit slowly and over a period of almost 25 years. \nFor example, in 1996, Hershey acquired Leaf Brand’s North \nAmerican operation, which owned the Jolly Rancher and \nPayday brands, and in 2018, it acquired other healthy snack \ncompanies, including Amplify Snack Brands, which made \nSkinnyPop popcorn. Diversification was, however, limited, \nand Hershey later divested of its pasta business unit.18\nIn 1970, increased competition, particularly from Mars, \nforced Hershey to advertise to consumers for the first time.19 \nThis major shift ushered in an era of systematic reputation- \nand brand-building for Hershey. It was a necessary and \nnotable departure from one of Milton’s founding business \nprinciples: “Give them quality. That’s the best kind of adver-\ntising in the world.”20 But implicit advertising through quality \nBertrand Guillotin wrote this case solely to provide material for class discussion.

In 1973, another shift took place: \nHershey stopped the company tours that had started in 1915 \nand opened Chocolate World, a museum about chocolate \nwith interactive exhibits, in Hershey, PA. Chocolate World \nexpanded domestically into other US cities and internation-\nally in Singapore.21\nThe Founder and his Values\nAmong the American business titans of his time, Milton \nstood out as an anomaly. According to Michael D’Antonio, a \nPulitzer-prize winning journalist who in his autobiography of \nMilton wrote, “He was tough-minded but fair. He wanted his \nworkers and their families to live in dignity.”22\nMilton’s generosity was grounded in the hard work and \nskills he had learned as a teenage apprentice of Joseph H. \nRoyer, a confectioner in Lancaster, PA. Equipped with new \nskills and armed with a $100 loan from his aunt, Milton made \nthe jump to entrepreneur status in 1876, opening his first \ncandy store in Philadelphia, PA. After six years of working \nday and night to make the candies he was selling himself, \nMilton became ill and experienced increased debt, forcing \nhim to sell this business.23 He headed west, learned in Denver \nthe importance of adding fresh milk to candies (it improved \ntheir quality and gave them a longer shelf life), opened a \ncandy shop in Chicago (another failure), and then tried his \nluck in New Orleans—to no avail. Back on the East Coast, in \nNew York, he opened another candy shop, which also failed.24\nReturning to Lancaster, Milton’s relatives refused to take \nhim in or lend him yet more money to start another business. \nIt was an old friend and former employee by the name of \nHenry Lebkicher, who had briefly worked for Milton in the \nPhiladelphia store, who gave Milton a place to live and paid \nfor him to bring his candy-making equipment back from \nNew York to start Lancaster Caramel Co. Applying the fresh-\nmilk innovation to caramels that he had learned in Denver, \nMilton created the unique Hershey Crystal A caramels. The \nquality and shipping stability of these new chewy caramels \nimpressed an English importer so much that he placed an \norder large enough to enable Hershey to secure a $250,000 \nloan to build several plants. This was a major turning \npoint, enabling the Lancaster Caramel Co. to spread across \nthe United States and hire 1,300 workers by 1893. The next \nturning point was Milton’s visit to the World’s Columbian \nExposition in Chicago. His insatiable entrepreneurial spirit \ncombined with the engineering capabilities to mass produce \nhelped him launch Hershey the following year.25\nMilton died at age 88 in 1945 in Hershey, PA. He had built \nhis business on solid corporate values and a unique corpo-\nrate structure that included a trust to carry out philanthropic \nefforts after his death.26 More than a century after its establish-\nment, the Hershey Trust Company still served as the trustee \nfor the Milton Hershey School (established in 1909), the \nM.S. Hershey Foundation, and the Hershey Cemetery.27 The \nHershey Trust Company was clear proof of Milton’s generosity \ntoward children. Also noteworthy was that the trust kept a \nminority stake in the company with a majority of the voting \nrights. While the trust only controlled 9 per cent of the shares, \nit controlled 80 per cent of Hershey’s voting rights.28 Among \nMilton’s famous quotes, the following epitomized the values \non which he had built his legacy: “If we had helped a hundred \nchildren it would have all been worthwhile,” and “One is only \nhappy in proportion as he makes others feel happy.”29\nThe Hershey Company Today\nValues\nEven after two world wars and more than a century later, \nMilton’s values were still present in the fabric of the company’s \nculture—in its DNA—as offered on the corporate website:\nRooted in Our Values\nOur founder, Milton Hershey, had a vision to make choc-\nolate accessible to everyone. His dedication to creating a \nbetter world continues to inspire our mission statement \nor as we call it, our purpose, of making more moments \nof goodness.\nOur brands and values create a unique place in people’s \nhearts and minds, differentiates our business and inspires \nour future growth.\nWe are inspired by our long-standing values of together-\nness, integrity, making a difference and excellence. These \nvalues make our company a special place to work and \ncan be seen in the daily actions of each of our employees \naround the world.\nCaring for our people and communities, taking care of \nthe planet, helping children succeed and making the best \nquality, affordable snacks for people everywhere to enjoy \nhave driven us for more than 125 years and will continue \nto do so.30\nPortfolio\nWith a portfolio of more than 80 global brands, Hershey was \nthe number-one chocolate producer in North America. This \nportfolio included well-known chocolate and candy brands \nsuch as Hershey’s Kisses, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Twizzlers, \nMounds and Almond Joy candy bars, York peppermint patties, \nand Kit Kat wafer bars.31 Hershey also made grocery goods—\nincluding baking products, toppings, sundae syrup, cocoa mix, \ncookies, snack nuts, breath mints, and bubble gum—and had \nexpanded into popcorn and other savoury snacks.32 \nHershey’s products were sold to a wide range of retail \noutlets and wholesale distributors in North America and \noverseas. Approximately one-third of Hershey’s products \nwere sold to McLane Company Inc., one of the largest whole-\nsale distributors in the United States. McLane, in turn, dis-\ntributed Hershey’s products to retailers throughout North \nAmerica, including Walmart Inc. Only about 10 per cent of \nsales were overseas. Hershey was centered on the US market \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

In international markets, the company added \nregional brands such as Pelon Pelo Rico confectionery prod-\nucts in Mexico, IO-IO snack products in Brazil, and Maha \nLacto confectionery products and Jumpin and Sofit beverage \nproducts in India.33\nMarketing Strategy\nHershey’s marketing strategy was anchored on strong and \nvaluable brands; product innovation, derived from consider-\nable corporate resources; and the consistently superior qual-\nity of its products. The company used a range of advertising \nand a variety of promotional programs directed toward its \ncustomers to stimulate sales of certain products at various \ntimes throughout the year.34 In 2020, the company spent  \n$517 million on advertising expenses.35\nOverall, the company’s vision was “anchored in four \ninterconnected strategies: 1) driving growth by captur-\ning more snacking occasions, 2) profitable and sustainable \ninternational expansion, 3) operating with best-in-class capa-\nbilities and partnerships, and 4) investing in people and com-\nmunities.36 To protect its brands and overall reputation—a key \nelement of its marketing strategy—the company had signed \nthe Cocoa Forest Initiative against deforestation, invested in \nCocoa For Good, and earned several fair trade certifications \n(see Exhibit 1).37\nFinancial Performance\nHershey’s marketing strategy had led to solid financial per-\nformance. From the time Buck became president and CEO \nin 2017, Hershey’s revenue increased from $7,515 million to \n$8,149 million in 2020 and net income grew from $782 million \nto $1,278 million in 2020 (see Exhibit 2).\nHershey’s research and development expenses were mar-\nginal for the period (see Exhibit 2), but the company did “a \nlot of consumer research” and innovated with packaging, \naccording to Susanna Zhu, vice-president of the US supply \nchain operations for Hershey.38 This lack of spending on \nresearch and development confirmed Hershey’s reliance on \nmarketing and strategic acquisitions to remain competitive.\nHershey also innovated through its digital transforma-\ntion, according to Doug Straton, chief digital commerce offi-\ncer for Hershey, capitalizing on digital consumer insights and \nincreasing the efficiency of both its merchandising ecosystem \nand overall supply chain.39 According to Buck, in addition to \nincreased efficiencies, Hershey’s focus on digital sales was gen-\nerating “higher average selling prices in the e-commerce chan-\nnel rather than in physical retail stores.” This phenomenon had \nled her to conclude that, “for Hershey, search is the new shelf.”40\nThe digital transformation, among other factors, had \ncontributed to an increase in cash—from $380 million in \n2017 to $1,143 million in 2020 (see Exhibit 3). Such financial \nperformance would have pleased just about any CEO.\nThe CEO\nBorn into a working-class family with a father who had started \nworking at age 14, Buck was characterized by one of her \nfavourite recruiters as a “bootstrapper”—someone who was \nambitious and eagerly pursued what she desired. She started \nworking at age 12 as a babysitter and continued to work her \nway through college and graduate school, earning a master of \nbusiness administration degree from the University of North \nCarolina. During that program, she discovered “a career that \ncombined my analytic abilities, creativity, and strong interper-\nsonal skills—a career in marketing and brand management.”41\nBuck joined Hershey in 2005 as the company’s chief \nmarketing officer, then worked her way up in the hierar-\nchy.42 Between 2017 and 2020, as CEO, Buck maintained \nor enhanced the power, value, and reputation of Hershey’s \nbrands, which were among the brands most loved by both \nkids and their parents (see Exhibit 4). Her brand manage-\nment performance had also contributed to the expansion of \nthe balance sheet’s intangible assets category, which more \nthan tripled from $369 million in 2017 to $1,295 million in \n2020 (see Exhibit 3). As chairman of the board, president, \nand CEO, Buck was among five women and ten men who \nhad come from different industries to govern Hershey.43 She \ncould tap into the bright minds of these seasoned executives, \nespecially in tough situations where the probability of a disas-\nter might have been low but certainly not inexistent.\nExhibit 2 The Hershey Company Net Income (in US$ ‘000)\nPeriod Ending\n2020-12-31\n2019-12-31\n2018-12-31\n2017-12-31\nTotal Revenue\n8,149,719 \n7,986,252 \n7,791,069 \n7,515,426 \nCost of Revenue\n4,448,450 \n4,363,774 \n4,215,744 \n4,060,050 \nGross Profit\n3,701,269 \n3,622,478 \n3,575,325 \n3,455,376 \nSelected Expenses\nResearch and Development\n0\n0 \n0\n0\nSales, General, and Administrative\n1,890,925\n1,905,929\n1,874,829\n1,885,492\nNet Income\n1,278,708 \n1,149,692 \n1,177,562 \n782,981 \nNet Income Applicable to Common Shareholders\n1,278,708 \n1,149,692 \n1,177,562 \n782,981 \nSource: Compiled and summarized by the case author from “HSY Financials,” Nasdaq, accessed March 5, 2021, https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hsy/financials.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In her blog relating to corporate \npriorities and Hershey’s 2018 plan, Buck stated the following \nregarding iconic brands:\nWe are fortunate to work on some of the most beloved \nbrands in the marketplace. Our brand strength is one of \nthe key pillars of our company’s reputation [see Exhibit 4]. \n… We have one of the most trusted and respected corpo-\nrate brands in America.44\nOn company purpose, she said,\nSharing Hershey goodness has recently taken a notable new \npath with last month’s launch of Cocoa For Good, a new \ncocoa sustainability strategy supported with a $500 million \ninvestment. Our work in cocoa-growing communities is \ncritical to the long-term health of the cocoa sector and will \nhelp bring positive change for cocoa growers, their families \nand communities.\nAdditionally, we look forward to updating our environ-\nmental strategy and human rights policies this year. We will \nbe working on these important initiatives in partnership \nwith The Ceres Company Network, to improve the sustain-\nability and resiliency in our operations and supply chain.\nWe have an aggressive business plan in 2018.45\nAs it turned out, Buck was prescient: implementing those \npriorities and an “aggressive business plan” would be chal-\nlenging, especially regarding Hershey’s global supply chain.\nSupply Chain, Societal, and Legal \nChallenges\nHershey was ranked near the very bottom of Green America’s \nChocolate Company Scorecard (see Exhibit 1). Its sup-\nply chain-related challenges not only included issues with \nlabour certification and efforts to stop deforestation but also \nincluded social expectations and beliefs captured in the insti-\ntutionalized environmental, social, and corporate governance \n(ESG) initiatives.\nIn 2020, Hershey did not even make the top-50 list of \nbest ESG companies. In fairness, no other chocolate man-\nufacturer made that list either. However, Procter & Gamble \nCo., another company with a household name, like Hershey, \nbut one focused on personal care, was ranked 33rd out of \n50 companies for its performance against ESG expecta-\ntions.46 In 2018, the Edelman Earned Brand study revealed \nthat “64 per cent of consumers around the world now buy \non belief, a remarkable increase of thirteen points since 2017. \nThese Belief-Driven Buyers will choose, switch, avoid or boy-\ncott a brand based on where it stands on the political or social \nissues they care about.”47\nExacerbated by the 2020 worldwide economic shutdowns \nand higher shipping costs resulting from the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic, supply chain challenges were becoming bigger and \nglobal. In addition, legal pressures to improve supply chains and \nto source responsibly had also been increasing. In 2016, the US \nCongress had “finally made it illegal to buy products made by \nslaves,” closing a loophole that had been in place since the Tariff \nAct of 1930—a loophole that many had conveniently ignored \nfor generations. This landmark piece of legislation, signed by \nPresident Barack Obama, was expected to “give enforcement \nagencies more latitude to investigate companies that operate in \nindustries known for forced and child labor, like the seafood \nor cocoa industries.”48 This regulatory pressure continued to \nincrease in 2020 as a result of a number of measures: the United \nKingdom had its published new guidance on the Modern Slavery \nAct 2015; the European Union introduced mandatory human \nrights and environmental due diligence legislation; and the \nUnited States introduction its Slave-Free Business Certification \nAct,49 a bipartisan effort intended to impose liabilities of up to \n$500 million for deliberate violations.50\nWith these legal efforts as a backdrop, Hershey, Mars, and \nMondelēz International Inc., three of the top five chocolate man-\nufacturers in the world, imported $437 million worth of cocoa \nbeans from Côte d’Ivoire and $192 million worth from Ghana in \n2018.51 These two countries, known for providing cocoa, the key \ningredient for chocolate, accounted for 70 per cent of the world’s \ncocoa production, with leading exports worth $3.6 billion for \nCôte d’Ivoire and $1.9 billion for Ghana. However, these num-\nbers came at “a steep human cost” for these countries. In Côte \nd’Ivoire, 600,000 cocoa farmers made approximately $1 each \nper day and 891,500 children worked in cocoa agriculture. In \nthe same year, Ghana had 800,000 farmers and 708,400 chil-\ndren working in cocoa agriculture.52 These numbers suggested \nthat the cocoa farms system producing most of the cocoa beans \nin the world was highly fragmented, with each farmer free to \nrun their farm as desired. Such fragmentation would logically \nmake it costly and difficult to track its participants (the farm \nworkers) in terms of their age, salary, and origin across all farms \nin a region of the world where many people had been displaced \ndue to war in the region (e.g., Mali).53\nIn addition, the industry had become more secretive \nin response to reports from organizations like the Food \nEmpowerment Project, a US non-profit organization, about \nthe industry’s reliance on child labour, and in some cases, slav-\nery, on West African cocoa farms. The Food Empowerment \nProject’s report described the horrible working conditions \nand perils for children as young as 10 years of age, who earned \nless than $2 dollars per day in West Africa. While recognizing \nthat “child slavery on cocoa farms is a difficult issue to fully \naddress because the most serious abuses take place across the \nworld,” the report also acknowledged the responsibility of \nconsumers in reducing some of the food industry injustices. \nConsidering chocolate to be a luxury as opposed to a neces-\nsity such as fruits and vegetables, the Food Empowerment \nProject created a list of recommended vegan chocolates that \ndid not source cocoa, and it “encouraged people not to pur-\nchase chocolate that is sourced from Western Africa.”54\nHershey had also become more secretive about how it \nwas obtaining its cocoa beans, according to NBC News—a \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In their letter \nof November 30, 2020, Hershey was accused of “abuse of the \nderivatives market to impoverish the West African farmer.” \nThat abuse was characterized as “a clear indication of your \n[Hershey’s] intent to avoid the payment of the Living Income \nDifferential [LID].” The LID forced chocolate companies to \npay an extra $400 per ton of cocoa beans to alleviate the pov-\nerty of three million West African farmers.55\nIvorian and Ghanaian cocoa regulators also accused \nHershey of being “highly unethical and in conflict with the \nconcept of sustainability,” in reference to Hershey’s sustain-\nability programs, which aimed to resolve industry prob-\nlems such as child labour abuses. Further, these regulators \nthreatened to bar Hershey’s sustainability programs, which \nhad been a source of pride for Hershey in both countries. \nResponding to the letter the following day, the company’s \nspokesperson, Jeff Beckman, wrote,\nWe don’t discuss our cocoa buying strategy. … That said, \nwe have also bought cocoa from other origins around the \nworld as part of our particular bean blend to achieve our \nunique Hershey’s chocolate flavor profile. And we will \ncontinue to do so. This long-time practice of sourcing \ncocoa from around the world should not be conflated \nwith avoiding paying the LID.56\nBeckman added a warning that if West Africa cut ties \nwith Hershey, the company would no longer be able to help \nthe region’s farmers. Beckman also described the company’s \nprograms that were geared toward “child labor monitoring \nand remediation, farmer training, [and] environmental pro-\ntection” as well as other issues that Hershey had been tackling \nin earnest.57\nBy December 4, 2020, Hershey had agreed with West \nAfrican regulators that it would buy beans from West Africa \nand pay the LID. NBC News concluded,\nThe battle sheds light on a decades long problem in an \nindustry riddled with child labor violations. A widely \nacclaimed documentary the BBC aired in 2000 first \nrevealed just how prevalent the use of child labor had \nbecome. Nearly two decades later, a 2018 report about the \ncocoa industry in Ghana and Ivory Coast, published by \nthe U.S. Labor Department, found that nearly 45 per cent \nof children living in agricultural households worked in \ncocoa fields, a total of at least 1.6 million children.58\nIn 2020, US cocoa bean imports increased by 1.2 per cent \nfrom 2019 and totalled $5.18 billion.59 These cocoa beans, \ncoming through the ports of Philadelphia, PA, and Camden, \nNew Jersey—which together accounted for at least 70 per cent \nof US imports from Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana—were destined \nfor 80 per cent of the processing plants strategically located \nwithin a 160-kilometre radius of the Delaware River. These \nmanufacturing facilities would “grind these raw beans into \ncocoa powder, cocoa butter, and chocolate ingredients to \nmake candy, ice cream, cookies and cakes.”60\nHowever sweet this process was, supply chain challenges \npersisted and legal pressures increased, while Hershey still \nhad not honoured its 2001 pledge to stop using child labour. \nThis apparent violation of corporate values was leaving Buck \nand her company exposed to major risks, such as litigation \nand reputational damage that could materialize from a boy-\ncott of its products on social media. Such a boycott could \nbe devastating, cost Hershey hundreds of millions of dollars, \nand give an immediate advantage to several of its compet-\nitors. A boycott could also force Walmart, Hershey’s single \nlargest retailer, to distance itself from the chocolatier.\nWith a shareholders’ meeting pending, Buck, as Hershey’s \nchairman and 12th president and CEO, had to consider how \nto address the mounting pressures and daunting supply chain \nchallenges. Indeed, these challenges were multi-faceted and \nimpacted the core business model of this 127-year-old iconic \nAmerican company. Her predecessors had failed in honouring \na public–private partnership pledge made in 2001, officially \nknown as the Harkin−Engel Protocol, to combat child labour \nin cocoa-growing communities.61 The pledge was renewed on \nSeptember 13, 2010, with government officials from Ghana \nand Côte d’Ivoire recommitting to the effort with $10 million \nin new funding from the United States and $7 million (with \npotential increases of an additional $3 million) from the \nchocolate and cocoa industry.62 But still, in 2021, Hershey \nseemed to be missing the target.\nWhat options were available to Buck to turn the tide and \ndemonstrate not just Hershey’s commitment to change, but \nits ability to make real change? The children in West Africa \nwere dependent on choices made by leading corporate figures \nlike Buck.\nNotes\n1. This case was written on the basis of published \nsources only.

Since those hum-\nble beginnings, the Hilton Hotel empire has grown to be one \nof the largest and most respected global hospitality brands. \nHilton’s vision is simple and remains true to its founder, \nConrad Hilton’s aspirations; “to fill the earth with the light \nand warmth of hospitality.”1 As of 2021, the hotel brand has \nmore than cashed in on Conrad’s vision. Hilton operates \nmore than 6,500 properties, across 18 hotel brands that span \n119 countries.2\nSince 2007, Hilton has been led by Christopher Nassetta, \na seasoned hospitality industry executive (see Exhibit 1 for top \nmanagement bios). Nassetta previously held a variety of senior \nleadership positions at Host Hotels and Resorts, Inc., a real \nestate investment firm focused on the hotel industry.3 Under his \nleadership, Hilton has continued to make great strides. Fortune \nMagazine has ranked Hilton #2 on its list of the “World’s Best \nPlaces to Work”, and Hilton remains the only hospitality brand \non the list. According to Nassetta, “our team members have \nalways been at the heart of our success, and at a time when the \nlight and warmth we share with the world has never been more \nimportant, we remain deeply committed to showing them the \nsame hospitality they share with our guests.”4\nHilton’s mission and values not only support this dedica-\ntion to its team members, but also a dedication to provide a \nwarm experience for the more than 3 billion guests it has wel-\ncomed at its properties. According to Hilton, its mission is “to \nbe the most hospitable company in the world – by creating \nheartfelt experiences for guests, meaningful opportunities \nfor team members, and high value for owners and a positive \nexperience in our communities.”5 Hilton supports its mission \nthrough six core values, using an easy to remember acrostic \nformat from their company name, Hilton.\n\t\n■ Hospitality: We’re passionate about delivering excep-\ntional guest experiences\n\t\n■ Integrity: We do the right thing, all the time\n\t\n■ Leadership: We’re leaders in our industry and in our \ncommunities\n\t\n■ Teamwork: We’re team players in everything we do\n\t\n■ Owners: We’re the owners of our actions and decisions\n\t\n■ Now: We operate with a sense of urgency and discipline6\nOperational Strategy\nHilton operates in the hotel industry and its portfolio includes \na wide array of hospitality experiences, which include “luxury \nlifestyle properties (Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, LXR \nHotels & Resorts, Conrad Hotels & Resorts, Canopy, Tempo \nand Motto), full service hotel brands (Signia, Hilton Hotels & \nResorts, Curio Collection, DoubleTree, Tapestry Collection \nand Embassy Suites), service hotel brands (Hilton Garden \nInn, Hampton, Tru, Homewood Suites and Home2 Suites), \nand finally a timeshare brand (Hilton Grand Vacations). \nGeographically, Hilton operates in three distinct regions:  \n(i) the Americas, (ii) Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and \n(iii) Asia Pacific. The Americas includes North America, \nSouth America, and Central America and represents 72% of \nHilton’s rooms, although in recent years Hilton has invested \nto build out its Asia Pacific footprint, especially in China.7 \nHilton’s two main business segments are: Management and \nFranchise and Property Ownership.\nManagement & Franchise Segment\nIn 2020, 99% of Hilton’s properties and 69% of Hilton’s rev-\nenues were associated with its Management and Franchise \nsegment. As of December 31, 2020, the Management & \nFranchise segment included 715 hotels and 5,646 franchised \nhotels consisting of 990,857 total rooms. The Management \nand Franchise segment includes all hotels Hilton man-\nages for 3rd party owners and the franchisee hotels that \nlicense the “Hilton” brand. As the 3rd party manager of \nhotels, Hilton is generally responsible for supervising and \non-site operations of the property. Hilton performs these \nservices in exchange for management fees. As a franchisor \nof hotels, Hilton charges fees in exchange for the right to \nuse the “Hilton” brand as well as other proprietary com-\nmercial systems such as reservation systems, marketing, \nand technology services.8\nFrom a revenue perspective, Hilton’s Management & \nFranchise segment earns revenue from two main sources:  \n(i) franchise and licensing fees and (ii) base and incentive \nmanagement fees. Hilton’s licensing fees represent revenue \nearned from licensing the “Hilton” brand. For the right to \n“use” the Hilton brand, franchisees will pay Hilton fees \nthat include monthly royalty payments, which are based \non a percentage of the hotel’s monthly gross revenue, and \napplication initiation fees for when new hotels are entered \ninto the system or there is a change of ownership. The \nbase and incentive revenues that Hilton earns through \nhotel management services represent base fees, which are \ntypically a percentage of the hotel’s gross revenue, and an \nincentive fee, which is based on the hotel’s operating prof-\nits and usually subject to a certain rate of return for the \nhotel owner.\nWritten by Jeffrey S.

As previously mentioned, in 2020 Hilton earned \n69% of its total revenue from the Management & Franchisee \nsegment and moving forward the company aims to earn \n~75% of its revenue from its Management & Franchisee \nsegment.10\nGrowth Strategies\nHilton’s “2030 Goals” include developing the Hilton Effect \nFoundation, which partners with local stakeholders rang-\ning from governments to suppliers to industry leaders \nto build out Hilton’s operational footprint, with the goal \nof increasing net units available by 397,000 rooms.11 To \ndo so, Hilton (i) recently completed the Hilton Garden \nInn Nequén in Argentina, (ii) is partnering with Resorts \nWorld on a $4.3 billion Las Vegas resort, and (iii) is part-\nnering with Country Garden, one of the largest developers \nin mainland China. Also, Hilton has continued opening \nnew hotels and increasing new rooms despite COVID-19, \nwhich resulted in a net unit growth of 5.1% from 2019 to \n2020. It’s new project pipeline is a key item Hilton repeat-\nedly champions on its investor calls, and its development \nmarket share is over three times larger than its main com-\npetitors Marriott and IHG.12\nThe company in more recent years has worked to solidify \nits brand, logos, and patents as it views these as key aspects \nthat differentiate Hilton from competitors and have real \nmeaning for consumers. The firm expects to continue growth \nvia “Dry Deals.” Dry deals do not require Hilton to contribute \ncapital and rely on 3rd party investors to take on the associ-\nated financial risk while Hilton advises and provides man-\nagement services during and after the build (i.e., incremental \nManagement & Franchise revenue).\nHilton plans to grow its hotel customer base through \ncontinued benefits offered via the Hilton Honors mem-\nbership. The system was originally created to maintain \nand reward customers who frequently travel for work, but \nhas been expanded to include all consumers in an effort to \nincrease customer loyalty and capture more of the pent-up \npost COVID-19 market demand. To further capture demand, \nHilton rolled out its “Confirmed Connecting Rooms” pro-\ngram that allows friends and family to book rooms adjacent \nto each other. This program was designed to make finding \nadjacent rooms easier and more convenient for clients and \nwas based on customer feedback.\nFunctional Resource Areas\nMarketing\nHilton’s marketing strategy is as diverse as the brands that it \noversees. In 2019, Hilton led the hospitality industry in US \nTV advertisement spending, with over $100 million.13 Overall, \nHilton aggressively pursues advertising across all media \nchannels. With so many brands in its portfolio, encompass-\ning luxury lifestyle brands like the Waldorf Astoria to service \nhotel brands like Hampton Inn, Hilton pursues both a whole \ncompany marketing (enterprise) strategy as well as individual \nbrand strategies. According to Chief Marketing Officer Kelly \nSmith Kenny, “The enterprise marketing strategy speaks to \nthe broad base of consumers and our loyal customers who \nare members of Hilton Honors. Strong design targets, brand \npositioning and brand architecture are the keys to each brand \nmeeting a unique consumer need.” If the enterprise strategy \nis a swimming pool, the individual brand positions within \ntheir portfolio are dividers for the “swim lanes.” Kenny also \ncommented “all of our marketing strategies are grounded in \ndeep consumer insight and rich data.”14\nFor example, before launching its Canopy by Hilton \nbrand in China, in addition to using traditional consumer \nresearch methods, Hilton also used neuroscience and brain \nmonitoring to better determine actual Chinese consumer \npreferences. By monitoring brain activity and tracking eye \nmovement, Hilton was able to understand unspoken emo-\ntional responses, likes, and dislikes of potential customers. \nGary Steffen, Global Head of Canopy by Hilton, commented \nthat “Hilton will continue to use human centered design \napproaches in its offerings to ensure its brand appeals to the \nevolving tastes and demands of discerning travelers.”15\nIn 2019, Hilton launched a new enterprise campaign \nExpect Better, Expect Hilton. This campaign was built on mar-\nket research showing that most travelers were unsure where \nthey could go to receive the best hotel price or perks.16 Hilton’s \nExpect Better, Expect Hilton campaign introduced a price \nmatch guarantee and a series of additional perks like no-cost \nWi-Fi, room selection, and digital keys.17 In 2020, and to \naddress travel concerns related to COVID-19, Hilton launched \nanother enterprise marketing campaign, To New Memories. \nThe campaign used heartwarming moments depicting peo-\nple reconnecting and the new memories they will be able to \nmake with Hilton. According to Mark Wesinstein, Senior \nVice President and Global Head of Marketing and Loyalty, \n“(this campaign) is designed to unlock those possibilities \nwith the assurances of the utmost in hospitality, cleanliness \nand flexibility Hilton hospitality is known for.”18\nHilton also offers an award-winning Loyalty Program, \nHilton Honors. This program allows guests to redeem points \nearned during stays for goods and services with Hilton and \nother brands. As such, Hilton has partnerships with over \n70 companies for loyalty program perks and redemptions. \nThese partner companies include airlines, rail and rental car \ncompanies, credit card providers, Amazon, Lyft, and more. \nAccording to Hilton, “the program provides targeted market-\ning, promotions and customized guest experiences.”19\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

It has been rec-\nognized as the one of the “World’s Best Places to Work” by \nFortune Magazineand has been ranked as a best place to work \nmore than 100 times by the Great Place to Work Institute. \nAccording to Michael Bush, CEO of Great Places to Work, \n“[Hilton’s] employee innovation score is among the best on \nour list and they re-invent their experience every year.21\nUnlike many corporations of its size, Hilton offers the same \nemployee benefits to all of its employees, both hourly and sala-\nried.22 Hilton also invests in its employees’ continued education \nand training. Through Hilton University, a global learning sys-\ntem that contains a robust library of learning resources, Hilton \nallows its employees to curate their own learning experiences \nand “follow training paths that are best suited for their goals \nand aspirations”.23 Hilton estimates that its employees spend \naround 40 hours a year on continuing education and training. \nIn 2017, Hilton furthered its employee enrichment resources \nby launching Thrive@Hilton. This employee initiative empha-\nsizes employee total well-being with a focus on mind, body, \nand spirit. In addition to offering Thrive@Hilton travel ben-\nefits, paid time off, parental leave, and education assistance, a \nhallmark of Thrive@Hilton is the Thrive Sabbatical Program.24 \nThis sabbatical allows Hilton team members the opportunity \nto take a four-week paid sabbatical and $5,000 to “spend time \ndoing what is most meaningful to them”.25\nHilton had to make significant changes to its human capital \nstructure during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, it instituted \norganizational changes that reduced global corporate head-\ncount by 30%. Additionally, Hilton was forced to temporarily \nfurlough 60% of its corporate employees. For the employees \nthat remained, Hilton enacted a temporary salary reduction. \nCorporate employees received between a 10%-20% salary \nreduction and executive committee members had salaries cut \nby as much as 50%.26\nSustainability\nIn 2018, Hilton announced its “Travel with Purpose 2030” goals. \nThese goals lay out a commitment to sustainability by dou-\nbling investment in social impact and cutting the company’s  \nenvironmental footprint in half by 2030.27 To accomplish this \ninitiative, Hilton has categorized its environmental impacts \ninto four main focus areas: Energy and Carbon, Water, Waste, \nand Responsible sourcing.28 The company is aggressively pur-\nsuing targets in these focus areas, and according to Daniela \nFoster, Senior Director of Responsibility, “the company \nbecame the first major hotel company to set approved sci-\nence-based targets in line with the Paris Climate Agreement \nto reduce carbon emissions, and will be the first to adopt \na global standard for sustainable tourism.”.29 For example, \nHilton was the first hotel brand to commit to sending zero \nsoap waste to landfills and currently operates the largest soap \nrecycling operation in the hotel industry. As of 2021 Hilton \nreported it was “on track” or “making progress” on all of its \n2030 goals.30\nImpact of Covid-19\nIn 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was felt \nthroughout the hospitality industry. As mentioned previously, \nHilton had to greatly reduce its global workforce to decrease \noverall operating costs and preserve liquidity. To assist the \nimpacted employees, Hilton offered severance pay, access to \nits outplacement service, and extended access to Go Hilton \ntravel discounts and Hilton Honors status.31 Hilton also dis-\ntributed $500,000 to its team members and their families \nto help cover medical expenses, groceries, and childcare for \nthose most impacted by COVID-19. Hilton’ trade association \nalso helped advocate for owners and team members regarding \nthe Paycheck Protection Program, tax relief, enhancements to \nunemployment, and relief from troubled debt.\nFrom a business response perspective, Hilton worked with \nthe Mayo Clinic’s Infection Prevention and Control team and \nimplemented “CleanStay” health and safety protocols, which \ndeveloped social distancing guidelines, signage, and provided \nPPE to employees. Of these, the Digital Key became a popu-\nlar feature, which Hilton plans to continue rolling out across \nits footprint. From a community perspective, Hilton part-\nnered with American Express and Jose Andres World Central \nKitchen to provide one million free room nights and 30,000 free  \nmeals to medical professionals and front-line workers.\nMany 3rd party hotel owners within Hilton’s portfo-\nlio experienced significant financing difficulties due to the \npandemic with lenders and creditors. Hilton itself received \na downgrade in its credit rating by S&P Global Ratings from \nBB+ to BB, with a negative outlook.32\nFinancial Status\nHilton Worldwide Hotels Inc., formerly Hilton Hotels, is a pub-\nlicly traded New York Stock Exchange entity listed under the \nticker symbol “HLT.” The company had a market capitalization \naround $40 billion as of October 2021, with about 2% of shares \nowned by company insiders and the remaining 98% owned by \ninstitutional investors. Blackstone Group held a large stake in \nthe company until 2018, when it decided to exit the hotel chain.\nDue to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hilton’s rev-\nenues fell from $3.77 billion in 2019 to $1.6 billion in 2020, and \nearnings fell from $881 million to a loss of $715 million during \nthe same time frame (see Exhibits 2 and 3). In response to finan-\ncial distress, Hilton dramatically reduced its operating expenses \nand tapped the debt capital markets to end 2020 with over  \n$4 billion in current assets. As the effects from COVID-19 began \nto subside in 2021, Hilton’s revenues increased to $2.4 billion, \nand the company earned $410 million in net income, still not up \nto pre-COVID levels, but a vast improvement over 2020.\nHilton’s External Environment\nHilton’s business and operations are primarily impacted by the \nfollowing drivers: (i) consumer demand / global economic condi-\ntions, (ii) changes in technology, and (iii) contracts / relationships  \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

A decrease in global demand / consumer  \nspending quickly and directly impacts the hospitality indus-\ntry, as consumers are quick to reduce their spending on lux-\nury items or services during times of austerity. Most recently, \nand as previously discussed, the effects of the COVID-19 \npandemic severely impacted Hilton as well as its competitors \nthroughout the industry.\nWith regard to changes in technology, with the creation \nand popularity of home sharing / vacation home rentals com-\npetitors (i.e.; Airbnb and VRBO), the business model for the \ntraditional hotel industry has been greatly impacted. More \nand more consumers are switching from traditional hotel \nchains in favor of Airbnb and VRBO; in fact, through June \n2021, Airbnb reported over 83 million customer nights at its \nlocations, and Airbnb and VRBO continue to invest heav-\nily to advertise their brands. Through February 2021, Airbnb \nand VRBO spent a combined $30 million in advertising.34\nFinally, contracts and relationships with 3rd party hotel \nowners, franchisees, and developers also remains a primary \nconsideration and priority for Hilton. Hilton depends on \nlong-term management and franchisee contracts with its \n3rd party owners. As previously mentioned, most of Hilton’s \nrevenues are from its Management and Franchisee business \nsegment and, going forward, Hilton aims to receive at least \n75% of its revenue from this group of customers. If Hilton’s \nrelationships with these partners or their financial positions \nwere to deteriorate, the Company’s near-term and long-term \nviability would be significantly impacted.\nIndustry Competition\nHilton encounters robust competition as a hotel manager, \nfranchisor, owner, and lessee. Hilton properties primarily \ncompete with hotels, resorts, inns, and “other accommoda-\ntion rental services” owned by local interests to national and \ninternational chains. Hilton has identified several key areas \nthrough which it competes with other hospitality brands. Most \nnotably, the key areas identified include: “room rate, quality \nof accommodation, consistency of service, brand reputation, \nand ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points”.35\nMarriott International, Inc.\nStarting out as an A&W Root Beer franchise in Washington \nD.C. in 1927, founders J. Willard Marriott and his wife Alice \neventually shifted their business and opened the first motor \nhotel in Arlington, Virginia in 1956.36 Since then, Marriott has \nbecome the largest hospitality brand in the world measured \nby both revenue and reach. It currently operates 30 brands \nand more than 7,000 properties across 131 countries.37 At the \nend of 2020, Marriott had over $10 billion in revenue, com-\npared to $4.3 billion for Hilton during that same period.38 \nLike Hilton, Marriott operates a quality tier brand structure \nthat covers Luxury, Premium, and Select tiers.39\nMarriott made headlines in 2016 when it outbid China’s \nAnbang Insurance Group to acquire Starwood Hotels & \nResorts Worldwide, Inc for $13.6 billion.40 Following the \nmerger, Marriott International owned 1 out of every 15 hotel \nrooms globally41.\nIHG Hotels & Resorts (IHG)\nForged over time from both Pan American Airways and Bass \nBrewing, this U.K. based hospitality group owns popular \nhotel chains such as Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza, and its flag-\nship Intercontinental Hotels.42 IHG is the third largest global \nhospitality brand by revenue, with $2.4 billion in revenue in \n2020.43 IHG oversees 16 brands, 6,000 hotels, and operates in \n100 countries.44\nIn 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, IHG \nrestructured its portfolio and underwent a brand redesign. \nFormally known as Intercontinental Hotel Group, it added the \ndescriptor “Hotels and Resorts” and restructured its 16 brands \nin 4 distinct “collections” to better help guests identify its offer-\nings. The four collections are Luxury and Lifestyle, Premium, \nEssentials, and Suites. In addition, IHG updated its brand \nlook and feel and changed the name of its loyalty program to \nbe more inclusive of all travelers. According to the company, \n“With an updated identity, IHG is focused on strengthening \nperception, how it engages guests, hotel owners and colleagues \nand better promoting the breadth of its portfolio.”45\nHyatt\nA major player in the global hospitality industry, Hyatt Hotels \nCorporation earned $2.1 billion in revenue in 2020. While \nthis makes Hyatt the fourth largest within the hospitality \ngroup by revenue, comparatively, its revenue was less than \nhalf of Hilton’s and one-fifth of Marriott’s during this same \ntime period. The Chicago based company operates 20 brands \nand 1,000 hotel properties across 68 countries.46\nLike its global hospitality competitors, Hyatt structures \nits brand across different quality tiers; however, according to \nCEO Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt is “the only multi brand com-\npany focused exclusively on the higher end traveler.”47 As such, \nHyatt has pursued a different growth strategy than industry \ngiants like Marriott and Hilton. Hyatt differentiates by promot-\ning health and wellness hospitality experiences and, in 2017, \nacquired the resort and spa group, Miraval Group, to expand \nits wellness offerings.48 Hoplamazian noted that “our research \nhas shown that our guests value wellness in an increasingly \nintense way.”49\nAirbnb\nEnvisioned in 2007 in a San Francisco apartment, Airbnb is a \ntech company that brokers connections between guests look-\ning for places to stay and hosts who have open accommoda-\ntions.50 Airbnb does not own any of its locations; instead, it \nconnects travelers with hosts who have homes, apartments, \nor residences in which they can stay. According to Airbnb, \nhosts make it “possible for guests to experience the world in \na more authentic, connected way.”51 Travelers pay the hosts \nand Airbnb collects a fee for its services. Most commonly, \nAirbnb charges a split fee for guests and hosts - hosts pay a \nservice fee of 3% of the total stay and guests pay a service fee \nof approximately 14% of the booking subtotal.52\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

It currently has 5.6 million listings worldwide,  \n4 million hosts, listings in 220 countries, and has welcomed over \n1 billion guests.53 It is estimated that in 2014, Airbnb reduced total \nhotel industry profits by 3.7 percent.54 After its IPO in December \n2020, Airbnb had an $86 billion valuation - more than Hilton, \nMarriott, and IHG combined on the same date.55\nOther Influences\nHilton operates around the world and markets outside of the \nU.S. continue to offer new sources of growth, most notably \nChina. Hilton views itself as a “local business that operates \nat a global level.” The company engages on the local, state, \nand national level throughout its footprint and has a compel-\nling list of benefits it brings to the communities and markets \noutside of additional jobs. Hilton also focuses on environ-\nmental protection / sustainability, fighting for racial justice, \ncombating slavery and human trafficking, and many more \ninitiatives. Hilton wants to enhance its ability to open new \nhotels throughout the world and in the markets that offer the \nhighest ROI. Hilton supports several lobbying groups, trade \nassociations, and travel associations in the United States and \nworldwide. In 2020, Hilton spent over $1 million in these lob-\nbying efforts.56 Hilton’s trade associations provide publicity \nand financial support for various governments. These efforts, \nalong with the additional tax revenue the company provides \nto the governments where it operates, make Hilton a sought \na partner for local and international governments.\nAnother external influence Hilton contends with is access \nto credit and capital markets. Lenders are a critical stake-\nholder upon which Hilton and other hotel operators depend. \nCOVID-19 hurt investor appetites for much of the hotel indus-\ntry. Securing adequate capital and financing continue to be top \npriorities for Hilton as it attempts to grow its asset base.\nPressing Strategic Issues\nAs Hilton continues to build upon Conrad’s vision,  \nMr. Nassetta and his leadership team face several challenges. \nHow can the company best plan to address any future impacts \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic or similar problems? How can \nHilton stop the erosion of its market share due to newcom-\ners like Airbnb? Also, what is the best approach to grow in \ndeveloping markets, especially China? In order to success-\nfully operate for another century, Hilton will need to plan for \nand address these issues in the near future.\nSource: Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2021. www.hilton.com/en/corporate/executive-bios/\nChristopher J.

(Facebook) \nagreed to buy a minority 9.99 per cent stake,2 worth US$5.7 \nbillion,3 in the Indian telecommunications (telecom) company \nReliance Jio Infocomm Limited (Jio), controlled by Reliance \nIndustries Limited (RIL). This was the largest investment by a \ntechnology company and the largest foreign direct investment \nin the technology sector in India. RIL’s chairperson and man-\naging director, Mukesh Ambani, announced that one of the \ngoals of the Facebook deal was to reduce RIL’s debt by 2021. \nJio expected to benefit by being able to exploit firm-specific \ncompetencies, access new markets, and increase its market \npresence and user base. The company would also gain access \nto complementary resources, institutional legitimacy, and \norganizational capabilities. Firms formed alliances not only \nfor differentiation but also to prevent others from gaining \na competitive edge by accumulating more capabilities; how \ncould Jio ensure a co-operative and complementary partner-\nship (despite their differences with Facebook) in order to suc-\nceed and set a precedent for future international alliances?\nReliance Industries Limited\nIn 2020, RIL was a global player in the integrated energy \nvalue chain, and it had a growing presence in retail and digi-\ntal services in India. It operated through six reportable busi-\nness streams: refining, petrochemicals, oil, gas, organized \nretail, and digital services. It was the largest publicly traded \ncompany in India in terms of market capitalization and the \nlargest private-sector organization in India. On October 18, \n2007, RIL became the first Indian company to have a market \ncapitalization in excess of $100 billion (see Exhibit 1). RIL, \nwith a value of ₹1,477.55 billion,4 was the largest merchandise \nexporter in India. The firm was ranked at 106 by the 2019 \nFortune Global 500 list. RIL was contributing 5 per cent of \ntotal revenues to the government of India from custom and \nexcise duty. RIL accomplished a market valuation of ₹13 tril-\nlion and it was the only Indian firm to achieve this. RIL was \nalso the highest income tax payer in Indian market.5\nRIL’s upstream businesses comprised the complete value \nchain, from oil exploration, appraisal, and development to \nhydrocarbon production. Jio, which took its name from the \nmirror image of the word oil, started its commercial opera-\ntions on September 5, 2016, and its performance had been \nunprecedented. The company gained more than 100 mil-\nlion subscribers in only five months, which it claimed was \nthe fastest-ever customer acquisition by a telecom service \nprovider or social media platform, including Facebook and \nTwitter. The company commenced operations by offering \nfree data and voice calling for the first three months, and \nthen extended the offer by another three months, which was \nbeneficial for many smartphone users.\nFacebook\nFacebook, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, was a \nUS social networking platform that allowed customers to \nshare ideas, opinions, pictures, videos, and other activities.6 \nThe company owned Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram, \nplatforms that allowed people around the world to engage \nin real-time communication.7 Facebook facilitated and dis-\ntributed advertising from marketers to consumers, who were \ntargeted on the basis of their social behaviour, age, location, \ntaste, interests, and gender. The company had a presence \nin Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the \nAmericas. Oculus, a virtual reality (VR) technology and con-\ntent platform, was one of its offerings.8\nFacebook classified its business into two reportable seg-\nments: (1) advertising and (2) payments and other fees.9 The \ncompany reported revenues of $55,838 million for the fiscal \nyear (FY) ended December 2018, an increase of 37.4 per cent \nover FY 2017.10 In FY 2018, the company’s operating margin \nwas 44.6 per cent; in FY 2017, it was 49.7 per cent. The com-\npany recorded a net margin of 39.6 per cent in FY 2018 and \n39.2 per cent in FY 2017. Facebook had become a global giant, \nwith 2.5 billion users and a market cap of $479.2 billion.11 In \nFY 2019, it reported a net income of $18.5 billion on $70.1 \nbillion in revenue (see Exhibit 2).12\nPrashant Salwan, Shailesh Pandey, and Srinivasan R Iyengar wrote this case solely to provide material for class discussion.

Zuckerberg and his co-founders launched the ser-\nvice for Harvard students but quickly expanded it to other \nuniversities and, later, the general public.14\nAcquisitions had been key to Facebook’s business and \nrevenue growth. Its strategy was to buy potential rivals \nbefore they could become too big. In the process, the com-\npany sometimes paid exceptionally high acquisition prices. \nBecause of potential anticompetitive practices, the com-\npany had also drawn attention from the US Federal Trade \nCommission, which had recently demanded data on unre-\nported purchases from Facebook and other big technology \n(big tech) companies.15 Facebook had acquired WhatsApp, \nInstagram, Oculus VR, Onavo, and Beluga within the past \nnine years (see Exhibit 3).16 It had 346 million active users in \nIndia in 2020.17 \nJio’s Alliances\nAiming to be India’s largest digital lifestyle company, Jio had \nentered into alliances to bring the best resources from around \nthe world to create value for its customers. Over the months \nfrom April to July 2020, leading technology investors, such \nas Facebook, Silver Lake Partners, Vista Equity Partners, \nGeneral Atlantic, and KKR and Co. Inc., had aggregate invest-\nments of ₹785.62 billion in Jio Platforms Inc. (Jio Platforms) \n(see Exhibit 4).18 RIL had raised more than ₹1,688.18 billion \nin just 58 days through investments from global technology \ninvestors; this included ₹1,156.93 billion from global investors \nand ₹531.24 billion for rights in Jio, raised on May 20, 2020 \n(see Exhibit 5).19\nStrategy Analysis: Intersectoral \nStrategic Alliances\nCompanies used alliances as strategic vehicles to expand \ntheir products and their geographic or customer reach. \nStudies showed that the success of alliances varied. Firms \nhad achieved and maintained success when they possessed \nalliance management capabilities—that is, superior organi-\nzational capabilities to manage the alliances.20 In an era in \nwhich alliances had become an important strategy, this capa-\nbility was considered a competitive advantage.\nCross-border alliances provided multinational firms with \nopportunities to stabilize resource exchanges, smooth global \noperations, increase market presence, and achieve faster mar-\nket entry. They also helped them maintain a higher level of \ncorporate flexibility than other modes of entry into markets, \nsuch as mergers and acquisitions. Strategic alliances were \nused not only to enable firms to withstand competition but \nalso to increase firms’ competitiveness. As market opportuni-\nties emerged, firms used alliances to enhance their capabili-\nties to meet increasing demand while utilizing their partners’ \nresources.\nJio’s Strategy\nJio used the bait-and-hook model, offering the basic product \n(i.e., the bait) at low or no cost and selling a complemen-\ntary product or refill (i.e., the hook) at comparatively higher \nprices. In this model, the complementary product was usually \nessential to the effective use of the core product. For example, \nJio gave out free 4G SIM cards with free phone calling, data, \nand over-the-top (OTT) media services that enabled non-4G \nusers to switch to 4G voice over long-term evolution (VoLTE) \nhandsets and the Jio ecosystem. Jio also practised penetration \nFY 2019\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nFY 2015\nRevenue\n6,116.45\n5,828.45\n5,810.20\n4,082.65\n3,301.80\nGross Profit\n1,915.03\n1,744.73\n1,475.02\n1,022.71\n7,42.69\nNote: ₹ = INR = Indian rupee; FY = fiscal year.\nSource: Company data.\nExhibit 1 Reliance Industries Limited Financials (₹ Billions)\nExhibit 2 Facebook Financials (US$ Billions)\nFY 2019\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nFY 2015\nRevenue\n70.697\n55.838\n40.653\n27.638\n17.928\nGross Profit\n57.927\n46.483\n35.199\n23.849\n15.061\nNote: FY = fiscal year.\nSource: Finance, Yahoo. 2019.

Throughout much of its history, WhatsApp \nallowed users to send messages and make calls directly to other users free of cost, regardless of loca-\ntion or usage patterns. Users could also share photographs, videos, and documents on the platform. \nFacebook bought WhatsApp when the smaller company boasted more than 400 million active monthly \nusers, which made it a fast-growing potential rival.\nThe price paid by Facebook, the highest-ever acquisition price for a private company, was based on \nWhatsApp’s growth potential. WhatsApp had been one of the world’s top apps. Since 2018, it had \nsurpassed Facebook Messenger to become the most popular over-the-top app, after Facebook and \nYouTube.\nRegarding monthly active users, WhatsApp was second only to Facebook. When WhatsApp was \nacquired by Facebook, it was an independent company that had recently been valued at $1.5 billion. \nThe revenue generated by WhatsApp was unclear. By some estimates, it could be as high as $5 billion  \nin 2020. \nInstagram\nType of Business: Photo- and video-sharing app\nAcquisition Cost: $1 billion\nAcquisition Date: April 9, 2012\nUser Base at Acquisition: 30 million\nInstagram, a photo- and video-sharing social networking platform, was launched in 2010. Users could \nupload, edit, and tag photos and videos. Even though it had been receiving significant attention from \nventure capital firms and other investors, the company had remained independent until it was acquired \nby Facebook for $1 billion in 2012. Some estimates were that Instagram generated more advertising \nrevenue than its parent company.\nWhen it acquired Instagram, Facebook opted to develop the Instagram app independently from its \nmain platform, and Instagram remained a separate platform. The purchase price for Instagram, which \nat that time was generating no revenue, reflected Facebook’s strategic decision to pay a premium for \nyoung companies. \nOculus VR\nType of Business: Virtual reality (VR) technology company\nAcquisition Cost: $2 billion\nAcquisition Date: March 25, 2014\nJust weeks after announcing its acquisition of WhatsApp, Facebook followed up by buying VR hardware \nand software company Oculus VR. Founded in 2012, the company was best known for Oculus Rift, a VR \nheadset that was designed for video gaming. Since Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus VR in 2014, the \nsubsidiary had made multiple acquisitions of its own. Perhaps the most prominent was the 2015 acqui-\nsition of Surreal Vision, a company specializing in 3D scene mapping reconstruction.\nAt the time Facebook acquired Oculus VR, the company had produced only a prototype of its popular \nheadset product. Facebook’s acquisition gave it an instant presence in the VR market at a time when \ndevelopers were showing growing interest in VR.\nOnavo\nType of Business: Mobile web analytics company\nAcquisition Cost: $100–$200 million (estimated)\nAcquisition Date: October 2013\nFounded in 2010, Israeli company Onavo performed web analytics on mobile apps to determine cus-\ntomer usage. Facebook acquired Onavo in October 2013 for an undisclosed amount that some analysts \nestimated at $100–$200 million. At the time of acquisition, it was an independent company. Although \nOnavo was not one of Facebook’s largest acquisitions, its technology might have influenced Facebook \nto make crucial early decisions about acquiring other apps and companies. Onavo was occasionally \nclassified as spyware, and this criticism forced Facebook to pull it from the app stores for iOS and An-\ndroid devices. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Facebook \nacquired Beluga for an undisclosed sum in the midst of the start-up’s fundraising. Through this acqui-\nsition, Facebook gained the technology that would eventually become its highly successful Messenger \nplatform.

The deal, which was announced in April, gave Mark Zucker-\nberg’s social media giant a firm foothold in India. The deal valued Jio at ₹46,200 trillion ($65.95 \nbillion) and was Facebook’s biggest since its 2014 purchase of WhatsApp for $22 billion. Jio, in \nreturn, was able to significantly reduce the RIL conglomerate’s debt.\nSilver Lake Partners\nLess than two weeks later, private equity giant Silver Lake Partners bought a 1 per cent stake \nin Jio for ₹56.5575 billion. The deal with the US firm valued Jio at ₹51,500 trillion, a 12.5 per \ncent premium over the value indicated by the social media network.\nVista Equity Partners\nUS-based private equity firm Vista Equity Partners (Vista), the world’s largest tech-focused \nfirm, acquired a 2.32 per cent stake in Jio for ₹113.67 billion. This investment gave Jio Plat-\nforms an equity value of ₹49,100 trillion and an enterprise value of ₹51,500 trillion. Vista’s \ninvestment was at a 12.5 per cent premium over the deal with Facebook. The deal indicated \nJio’s status as a next-generation software and platform company.\nGeneral Atlantic\nOn May 17, Reliance Jio sold a 1.34 per cent stake to New York–based General Atlantic, a \nprivate equity firm, for ₹65.9838 billion. The deal was General Atlantic’s largest investment in \nAsia. “This investment values Jio Platforms at an equity value of ₹49,100,000 trillion and an \nenterprise value of ₹51,600,000 trillion. General Atlantic’s investment will translate into a 1.34 \nper cent equity stake in Jio Platforms on a fully diluted basis,” the company said in a statement. \nGeneral Atlantic was a leading global growth equity firm with a 40-year record of investing in \nthe technology, consumer, financial services, and health care sectors.\nKKR and Co. Inc. \nReliance Industries Limited announced on May 22, 2020, that KKR would invest ₹113.67 billion \nin Jio Platforms. With this transaction, Jio Platforms achieved an equity value of ₹4.91 trillion \nand an enterprise value of ₹5.16 trillion. This was KKR and Co.

It did this for new product launches \non the understanding that prices would be raised at the end \nof the promotional period, after the company’s market share \nobjectives had been achieved.\nJio also used diversification as a growth strategy to gain \nmarket share in different domains. It diversified its product \nportfolio in areas such as telecom, OTT, health care, retail, \ne-commerce, the Internet of things (IoT), VR, and aug-\nmented reality (AR).\nChanges in the Telecom Industry  \nafter Jio’s Entry\nThe telecom industry was undergoing a number of signifi-\ncant changes around the time of Jio’s entrance.\nUltra-Cheap Data\nBefore Jio’s entry into the telecom industry, data plans were \nexpensive, and consumers had to pay up to ₹450 for one \ngigabyte (GB) of data. The highlight of Jio’s launch offer \nwas the free data it offered to consumers (4 GB of high-\nspeed 4G data per day). Once customers reached this limit, \nthey would get continued data at 128 kilobytes per sec-\nond. The company eventually charged its customers fees \nafter the incumbent operators protested. However, the fees \nwere so low that consumers paid approximately ₹10 per GB \nof 4G data—an offer that no other operator could match. \nJio’s data prices were among the lowest in the world. The \ncompany took advantage of the changing consumer trend \naway from voice toward data consumption and shifted its \nfocus away from the voice-calling price wars to the data \nprice wars.21\nIncreased Consumption of Online Content\nIndia had experienced an exponential rise in the consump-\ntion of online content since free data became available. Jio \nclaimed that India’s data consumption grew from 0.2 billion \nGB to 1.2 billion GB in six months, with the average con-\nsumer now using 10 GB of data per month.22\nFree Voice Calling\nVoice calls became free for all consumers across all telecom \nnetworks when Jio launched operations. The company stated \nthat local and subscriber trunk dialling (STD) calls from its \nnetwork to other networks would be permanently free, and \nits rivals eventually followed suit, offering pre- and post-paid \npackages with free bundled minutes for STD and local voice \ncalls to all networks. Jio stated that its network carried 2.5 \nbillion minutes of free calls per day for customers.23\nProliferation of 4G Smartphones\nAfter Jio launched its services, the 4G smartphone mar-\nket grew rapidly because of free access to its 4G network. \nAlthough 4G handsets became available in the affordable \nsegment in late 2015, 4G VoLTE-capable smartphone prices \ndropped to ₹2,999 after Jio’s launch. Indeed, according to data \nfrom the International Data Corporation and Morgan Stanley \nResearch, 95 per cent of the smartphones sold in India in the \nfirst quarter of FY 2016 (September to December) were 4G \ncapable.24\nFaster Mobile Data\nWith 4G becoming the norm, mobile data speeds increased \nsignificantly over the 3G networks that most people had used. \nA June 2020 report from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of \nIndia (TRAI), using its My Speed application (app), indicated \nthat Jio offered average download speeds of approximately 18 \nInvestments in Jio as of May 26, 2020\nCompany\nAmount (₹ Billions)\nStake (%)\nFacebook Inc.\n435.74\n9.99\nSilver Lake Partners\n56.56\n1.00\nVista Equity Partners\n113.67\n2.30\nGeneral Atlantic\n65.98\n1.34\nKKR and Co.

The market presented lim-\nited opportunities and resources that both firms needed to \naccess. Facebook increased its market share by establishing \nalliances with telecom and mobile manufacturing companies, \nthus ensuring that its products were installed by default to \nincrease the number of users who accessed its social media \nservices through the Facebook mobile app.26\nFacebook used diversification to support an intensive \ngrowth strategy with the main objective of establishing new \nbusinesses. For example, the company acquired Oculus VR \nin order to offer VR technology to complement its social net-\nworking services. This intensive growth strategy supported \nFacebook’s strategic objective of acquiring or establishing new \nsubsidiaries or businesses to increase revenues and its mar-\nket reach. The implementation of this cost leadership generic \ncompetitive strategy was undergirded by cost minimization.27\nBenefits of the Jio–Facebook Alliance\nRIL’s total investment in Jio was approximately ₹18,000,000 \ntrillion. Therefore, what effectively cost the company approx-\nimately ₹180 billion (a 10 per cent stake) was sold for more \nthan three times that amount (₹435.74 billion) to Facebook.28 \nIt could be considered that the value created by Jio through \na successful business model of staking a claim was thrice the \nvalue of the initial investment. Beyond this, what did these two \ngiants gain from this deal? Few theories explained the impli-\ncations for the companies and for consumers. The partnering \nof these two powerful platforms would not only create richer \nconsumer experiences but also provide 400 million consum-\ners with access to the digital India dream. The Facebook–Jio \ndeal was much deeper than it appeared on the surface; it was \ncentral to a well-considered philosophy that could ultimately \nreap large returns in ushering in a hyperlocal digital India.29 \nJio had the potential to leverage its online and brick-and-mor-\ntar retail customers with Facebook’s subscriber base.\nSeveral factors made the alliance beneficial for both com-\npanies.\nReliance Industry Limited’s Ecosystem\nRIL’s entry into the telecom industry with the launch of Jio \nlaid the foundation for India’s digital transformation.30 RIL’s \nloss-leader strategy of offering free phone calling, short mes-\nsaging service (SMS), 4G data, and OTT services enabled it \nto become India’s largest telecom company. Jio built an eco-\nsystem that included telecom, digital services, and informa-\ntion technology infrastructure. Jio was poised to capture the \nmarket for fibre to the x, a fixed-line fibre-optic broadband \nconnection that was currently under-penetrated. It would be \nable to offer JioTV to its subscribers, thereby disrupting the \nsatellite television industry.\nReliance Industry Limited’s Ambition  \nto Be Debt-Free\nFacebook’s investment would help RIL achieve its goal of \nbeing debt-free by early 2021. Jio was expected to retain ₹150 \nbillion of the cash from the Facebook deal. The remainder \nwould be used by RIL, which would lower its debt by redeem-\ning the optionally convertible preference shares it held. This \ninvestment was expected to reduce RIL’s debt by ₹500 billion. \nIn December 2019, RIL’s gross debt was more than ₹3 trillion, \nand its net debt was ₹1.53 trillion.31\nFacebook’s Penetration in India\nIndia accounted for the highest percentage of Facebook’s 2.44 \nmillion monthly active users. Approximately 20 per cent of \nWhatsApp’s more than two billion users were in India,32 where \nInternet use was still limited to a few apps, such as YouTube \nand WhatsApp, which had become household names. The \nnumber of Facebook users in India was expected to increase \nfrom 281 million in 2018 to 444.2 million in 2023, indicating \nthat the user base was growing steadily.33 \nRegulatory Woes\nFacebook needed an Indian representative, and its investment \nin Jio was a safeguard against the political risks of entering \nIndia, which included intense scrutiny of big tech, particu-\nlarly foreign companies, by law enforcement and concerns \nabout the management of the sensitive data of Indian citizens \nand organizations. Facebook had previously been criticized \nfor issues ranging from net neutrality to Pegasus spyware.34 \nIt had also come under increasing scrutiny from the Indian \ngovernment, and this had negatively affected its image. This \ndeal could prompt Facebook to leverage Jio’s user base to allay \nsome of these fears by investing in India’s growth. The alli-\nance could create many opportunities (see Exhibit 6).\nConnecting Online and Off-Line Businesses\nThe Jio–Facebook alliance enabled both companies to \naccess new markets, expand their geographic reach, obtain \ncutting-edge technology, and complement their skills and \ncore competencies relatively quickly. Thus, the alliance was \nimportant for both companies. JioMart, Jio’s new digital \ncommerce platform, and WhatsApp would enable nearly 30 \nmillion small Indian kirana shops35 to engage in digital trans-\nactions with the customers in their neighbourhoods, as local \nvendors and small kirana businesses would be able to register \non JioMart and receive orders through WhatsApp.36\nThrough its features, WhatsApp, the new super app, \nfacilitated many activities and transactions (including gam-\ning and retail commerce) for 60 million small businesses \nacross India. The model had been very successful in other \nAsian countries, such as China, Korea, and Japan. Apps such \nas WeChat, Line, and Kakao Talk also enabled gaming and \nretail commerce activities. WhatsApp saw an opportunity to \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

In addition, RIL’s strong \nretail supply chain network could provide support for the \nkiranas.38 Currently, the kiranas’ biggest challenge was their \nsupply chains, inventory management, and inability to match \nthe deals offered by organized retailers.39\nValue Creation through WhatsApp\nUnsurprisingly, a majority of Indian WhatsApp users lived \nin urban rather than rural areas. Between 2017 and 2018, \nWhatsApp had seen a significant (18 per cent) increase in \nurban users. Interestingly, WhatsApp also saw a surge in rural \nusage, which more than doubled by 2018 to reach a penetra-\ntion level higher than that for urban penetration in 2017.40\nWhatsApp usage increased across all socio-economic \ngroups. While wealthier Indians made up a higher propor-\ntion of users, the most significant increase in usage was \namong those classified as lower income. Between 2017 and \n2018, usage increased sixfold in this income bracket and more \nthan twofold among the middle class.41\nThe results by age were relatively predictable. WhatsApp \nusage was higher among younger people; however, both \nWhatsApp and Jio saw an increase of roughly two-thirds. \nDespite a stronger percentage increase, usage among older \ndemographics lagged behind that in other age groups. As \nof May 2018, three million businesses had signed up for \nWhatsApp Business.42 Businesses could contact only those \npeople who had provided their numbers and agreed to be \ncontacted. The goal was to improve client–customer com-\nmunication for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). \nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, WhatsApp Business facil-\nitated ordering and fulfillment, and other communication \nwith customers.43\nOpportunities Created\nDetails\nPenetrate the Unorga-\nnized Retail Sector\nBringing WhatsApp and online grocery delivery platform JioMart together allowed Facebook to \nconnect millions of consumers with neighbourhood kirana stores and the other small businesses \nthat continued to be the backbone of India’s unorganized retail sector. Industry estimates indi-\ncated that the target audience was likely to be approximately 60 million small businesses across \nthe country. Reliance termed this business model “new commerce.” The model aimed for inclusive \ngrowth that included the kirana stores rather than perceiving them as a threat.\nEnable Social Commerce\nFacebook could facilitate a burgeoning social media marketplace in which resellers, SMBs, and \nmicro-entrepreneurs could connect with potential customers or buyers. This was not the first time \nFacebook had shown an interest in this growing community. In 2019, it bought a minority stake in \nMeesho, one of India’s fastest-growing social commerce platforms.\nDrive Digital Payments\nThe deal was also expected to help Jio and Facebook compete with digital payment financial \ntechnology players—such as Walmart-owned PhonePe, Alibaba-backed Paytm, Google Pay, and \nAmazon Pay—in the Indian digital payment space, which was expected to increase fivefold to \nreach US$1 trillion by 2023. WhatsApp Pay was launched in India on February 7, 2020. Although \nit had faced regulatory issues around data localization, efforts were being taken to get regula-\ntory approval. The deal could allow WhatsApp Pay to compete with services such as Google Pay, \nPhonePe, and Paytm. Frost & Sullivan’s analysis indicated that WhatsApp would eventually allow \nconsumers to pay for items bought on JioMart. \nExpand Economic  \nOpportunities\nThis partnership would expand Facebook’s economic opportunities, especially its digital advertis-\ning platform, in India. This partnership also augured well for India, where WhatsApp was the top \nmessaging app. WhatsApp and Facebook had helped to provide Internet access to millions, and \nthis partnership would continue to accelerate the shift toward digitization. Over the long term, \nthis could also have a positive effect on employment, with new supply chain and delivery jobs \nadded.\nLeverage India’s Internet\nJio had built a future-proof infrastructure. Broadband Internet in Indian homes and small and \nmedium-sized enterprises would be powered by 5G and pan-Indian fibre-optic cable. With this al-\nliance, Facebook got to own a stake in India’s Internet and communications infrastructure. Regard-\ning the Facebook–Jio Platforms deal, the two companies could leverage each other’s strengths to \nbuild a connected ecosystem comprising payments, telecom, and off-line and online commerce in \na previously unseen manner.\nNote: SMB = small and medium-sized businesses.\nSource: Compiled by the case authors using data from Kiran Kumar, “Five Reasons the Reliance Jio Deal Is a Win-Win for Facebook,” Frost & Sullivan, April 23, 2020, accessed May 22, \n2020, https://ww2.frost.com/frost-perspectives/five-reasons-the-reliance-jio-deal-is-a-win-win-for-facebook/#:~:text=Frost%20%26%20Sullivan’s%20analysis%20indicates%20that,the \n%20messaging%20app%20as%20well.&text=WhatsApp%20and%20Facebook%20have%20helped,shift%2.\nExhibit 6 Opportunities Created Through the Jio–Facebook Deal\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The WhatsApp \nrevenue model had never delivered high returns. In \nFebruary 2014, before WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook, \nWhatsApp’s revenues were a relatively meagre $1.3 million.44\nIndia’s Digital Transformation\nThe synergy between Jio and Facebook would help to realize \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s Digital India mission, with \nits two ambitious goals: ease of living and ease of doing busi-\nness.45 The Facebook–Jio deal, with its focus on expanding \nhyperlocal e-commerce to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and even \nrural areas, could be a major catalyst in India’s digitization \nstory.46 Jio had become the market leader with 370.1 million \nsubscribers, followed by Vodafone Idea Limited, with 332.61 \nmillion; Bharti Airtel Limited, with 327.3 million; Bharat \nSanchar Nigam Limited, with 118.21 million; Mahanagar \nTelephone Nigam Limited, with 3.38 million; and Reliance \nCommunications Limited, with 0.02 million.47 Jio had built a \nmassive infrastructure that had democratized digital connec-\ntivity for more than 370 million Indian citizens.\nFacebook had built a strong distribution network in \nIndia, with more than 400 million users on WhatsApp, more \nthan 280 million on Facebook, and more than 88 million on \nInstagram.48 Access to this network could allow small kiranas \nto use digital technology to grow their businesses and create \nnew employment opportunities.49 These opportunities could \nbe extended to other key stakeholders in the Digital India \nmission, such as kisans (agricultural workers), SMEs, educa-\ntional institutions, and health care providers. The investment \nin Jio was Facebook’s third in India since it had acquired \nMeesho, a social commerce app, and Little Eye, a start-up that \nbuilt analytical tools for mobile app developers. According to \nFacebook’s press release on the Jio deal, this acquisition rep-\nresented the company’s investment in India’s future—a claim \nthat was helped by the perception of Jio as a symbol of the \nSwadeshi or Make in India digital initiative.50 The deal would \ngive Facebook access to the data Jio had gathered from its \nsmartphone subscribers and could also bring about a power \napp that combined Jio’s and Facebook’s services.\nThe Indian e-commerce sector was expected to grow from \n$30 billion in 2018 to $200 billion by 2028.51 While Amazon.\ncom Inc. and Flipkart (owned by Walmart Inc.) currently con-\ntrolled more than 60 per cent of India’s e-commerce market, \naccording to market intelligence firm S&P Global,52 Jio and \nFacebook had an edge regarding data acquisition. The deal \nthat had paired local commerce with social media had also \ncreated one of India’s biggest data platforms, which would \nbe difficult for other e-commerce players to match quickly. \nRIL was also negotiating the acquisition of Future Group, \nthe pioneering organized-retail group with a presence in cit-\nies. Its stores included Big Bazaar, FBB, Food Bazaar, Food \nHall, HomeTown, Brand Factory, and Planet Sports.53 Future \nGroup had recorded more than 600 million customer visits \nin a year to its 2,000 retail stores, which occupied more than \n2.2 million square metres of space in more than 400 cities and \ntowns. The conclusion of the deal would further strengthen \nRIL’s position in retail.54\nFuture Initiatives\nJio’s launch had been influenced by the dream of India’s dig-\nital sarvodaya—an inclusive digital rise that would improve \nthe quality of life for every Indian and propel the country to \nthe position of the world’s leading digital society. Jio provided \na range of digital services in its ecosystem: free 4G voice call-\ning, free SMS, Jio Drive cloud storage, JioChat, JioMoney, and \nOTT apps such as JioTV, JioCinema, JioSaavn, JioSecurity, \nJioHealthHub, and JioMart. Jio also offered JioFiber Internet \nand a set-top box, JioSTB. Future projects included smart-\nhome IoT services for smart televisions, speakers, cameras, \ngas leak sensors, and door locks—devices and services \nthat were connected to the Jio ecosystem through JioFiber  \n(see Exhibit 7). The Jio Smart Car, a small on-board diag-\nnostics device, worked like a JioFi hotspot for 10 devices if \nplugged into a car’s port; it could capture all the information \nabout a car, including fuel and brake fluid levels, battery life, \nand mileage. The Jio Car Connect app recognized drivers’ \npatterns and use of features such as locks, headlights, power \nwindows, and remote location trackers, and a “fencing” \noption could track speeds and distances and even provide an \nalert if the car went beyond a specific area.\nFacebook was investing heavily in small businesses, and \nIndia’s position as a hub for small and medium businesses was \nideal for the company’s social networking plan.55 Facebook \ncould leverage Jio’s diverse communications network divi-\nsion to reach these businesses and to provide online access to \nenable them to expand their portfolios.\nBlockchain and Cryptocurrency\nThe Facebook and Jio alliance would also provide a basis \nfor blockchain and cryptocurrency infrastructure and appli-\ncations in India. In August 2019, Jio announced that it had \ninstalled one of India’s largest blockchain networks, with \ntens of thousands of nodes. At that time, Ambani stated that \nblockchain technology would engender trust and deliver \nunprecedented security, automation, and efficiency for \nalmost any type of transaction.56 While Jio was building a \nblockchain network with thousands of nodes, Facebook was \nworking on the Calibra project, which aimed to provide ser-\nvice for 1.7 billion unbanked people around the world. It was \nhoped that blockchain technology would have a promising \nfuture in India.57\n5G Networks\nFacebook had previously partnered with a telecom provider \nin Japan, taking advantage of that country’s 5G networks to \nprovide AR and VR products.

A strategic part-\nnership with India’s largest telecom operator would also be \nkey to Facebook’s future plans, particularly those relating to \nVR and IoT, whose success would depend on 5G access. Jio \nhad reportedly developed its own end-to-end 5G technol-\nogy and had sought the TRAI’s approval for 5G trials. This \ninvestment in Jio’s platforms could give Facebook access to \nthe 5G technology and telecom infrastructure it needed while \ninsulating it from the accompanying regulatory scrutiny and \ncompliance.58\nThe Future for Jio and Facebook\nJio’s management wanted to advance their strategic alliance \nto gain access to Facebook’s customer bases and deeply inte-\ngrated ecosystems. This partnership could upend India’s \ne-commerce market. Jio had its own messaging apps, mov-\nies, and health care, which it had not been able to monetize. \nJoining the country’s most widely used communication plat-\nform could boost its hopes of becoming a retail giant and \nspeed up India’s transition to digital commerce. Jio, in part-\nnership with Facebook, could be very competitive because \nit had more insights into consumers. The increasing pace of \nglobal business and the demands and sophistication of cus-\ntomers had resulted in dramatic changes in the competitive \nlandscape. Markets had been changing so quickly that it was \nvery difficult for a single company to have all the necessary \nresources, including information, and to maintain the cur-\nrent technology and competencies needed for entry and suc-\ncess. Non-technology companies, such as RIL, had moved \ninto digital services and were willing to form partnerships \nwith new-age companies to benefit their businesses. Fewer \nconventional companies had made this transition as suc-\ncessfully as Jio had in petrochemicals, refining, retail, and, \nmost recently, digital services. Jio had entered into strate-\ngic alliances to capture windows of opportunity in favour-\nable markets. How could Jio ensure a co-operative and \ncomplementary partnership (despite their differences with \nFacebook) in order to succeed and set a precedent for future \ninternational alliances?\nExhibit 7 Jio’s Presence in the Indian Market\nNote: FTTx = Fiber to the x ; IoT = Internet of things; AI = Artificial intelligence ; AR = Augmented reality ; VR = Virtual reality; PC = Personal Computer; STB = Set Top Box  ;  \nFSA = Flexible spending account.\nSource: Company documents.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Because Marriott operated 11 hotels in Wuhan and another \n350 across greater China, Linnartz and the Marriott team wit-\nnessed early warning signs of the virus’s quick and lethal impact \non the hospitality business. By the first week of February 2020, \nbefore COVID-19 had officially been declared a pandemic, Mar-\nriott was already feeling its effects. Sorenson discussed the virus’s \nsevere impact in his March 2020 message to Marriott’s associates: \nIn terms of our business, COVID-19 is like nothing we’ve \never seen before. For a company that’s 92 years old, that’s \nborne witness to the Great Depression, WWII, and many \nother economic and global crises, that’s saying something. \nHere are the facts. COVID-19 is having a more severe and \nsudden financial impact on our business than 9/11 and the \n2009 financial crisis combined. The worst quarter we had in \nthose earlier crises saw a roughly 25% decline in hotel reve-\nnues, on average, across the globe. In this case, which began \nin greater China in January, we quickly saw a 90% decline in \nour business in China. In the two months since, we have seen \nCOVID-19 extend to the rest of the world. In most markets, \nour business is already running 75% below normal levels. \nThe principal challenge we face is obvious. The restric-\ntions on travel, gatherings of people, and required social \ndistancing is having an immediate impact by depressing \ndemand for our hotels. As a result, we have hotels around \nthe world that can’t operate without incurring substantial \neconomic losses and risking permanently their ability to \nreopen when this gets behind us. This has caused hun-\ndreds of hotels to close or start the process of closing until \nsuch time as demand begins to return. I can tell you that \nI have never had a more difficult moment than this one. I \nhave never been more determined to see us through than \nI am at this moment.3 (See Exhibit 1 for full transcript.)\nNearly eight months had passed since Sorenson had tweeted \nthis video message, and the world looked like a drastically dif-\nferent place. As Linnartz gazed out the window of her family’s \nhome in Washington, DC, she reflected on how the pandemic \nhad created an unpredictable crisis for an industry already \nexperiencing substantial upheaval. Even before COVID-19’s \narrival, technology and digital transformation were disrupt-\ning nearly every aspect of the hospitality business by ushering \nCase 11\nMarriott International: Hospitality’s Uncertain Future\nSuccess seems to be connected to action. Successful people keep \nmoving. They make mistakes, but they never quit.\n— J. Willard Marriott1\nStephanie Linnartz, group president of consumer operations, \ntechnology, and emerging businesses at Marriott Interna-\ntional (Marriott), sat back in her chair and closed her laptop \nwith a heavy sigh.2 She had just rewatched the video message \nthat her boss, Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson, had released on \nTwitter to address all Marriott employees on March 19, 2020, \nduring the early days of the COVID-19 global pandemic. \nTo say the last 18 months had been challenging for Linnartz \nwould be a tremendous understatement. In the spring of 2019, \nshe had learned with a heavy heart that Sorenson had been \ndiagnosed with stage 2 pancreatic cancer and would undergo \nchemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy treatments to \nfight the disease. Although doctors caught the cancer early \nand Sorenson had expressed his commitment to “continue \nworking at the company [he] love[d],” Linnartz felt height-\nened pressure to continue driving success and innovation \nacross the critical business functions she managed. The hos-\npitality industry had experienced a number of significant dis-\nruptions in recent years, driven by such trends as the sharing \neconomy, shifting consumer preferences toward personaliza-\ntion, and advancements in hotel-related technologies. \nLinnartz had grown up in the hospitality business and \nhad been part of the Marriott family for nearly 25  years. \nHaving started as a financial analyst for Marriott in 1997, \nshe rose through the ranks to become an integral member of \nMarriott’s executive team due to her distinct ability to fore-\ncast and manage shifts and disrupters in the industry. Under \nher leadership, Marriott had developed and incubated new \nlines of business related to the company’s loyalty program, \nMarriott Bonvoy (Bonvoy), and more recently had launched \na new premium home rental offering, Homes & Villas by \nMarriott International. Given these successful innovations, \nLinnartz had begun 2020 with tremendous optimism about \nMarriott’s future; as the largest hospitality company in the \nworld, Marriott had seemed well positioned to maintain \nindustry leadership into the foreseeable future. However, nei-\nther Linnartz nor anyone else at Marriott had anticipated the \nunprecedented effects of the global pandemic. \nFirst discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the \ndeadly COVID-19 virus rapidly spread to every corner of the \nglobe and immediately disrupted all aspects of normal life. \nThis case was prepared by Jared D. Harris, Samuel L. Slover Associate Professor of Business Administration; Scott Snell, E. Thayer Bigelow Professor of Business \nAdministration; and Katharine Harrison (MBA ’20).

I’m here to give you an update on Coronavirus, or COVID-19, on our business and the steps we’re \ntaking to respond to it. Because of the profound impact COVID-19 is having on so many of us around the world, this is the most \ndifficult message we have ever pulled together. \nOur team was a bit concerned about using a video today because of my new bald look. Let me just say that my new look is \nexactly what was expected as a result of my medical treatments. I feel good and my team and I are 100% focused on overcom-\ning the common crisis we face. Now let’s talk about that crisis, COVID-19. Let’s start with the health challenge itself. Across our \ncompany, the number of COVID-19 infected associates is low, and I am grateful for this. I want to acknowledge the associates \nwho are dealing with it as a patient, parent, family member, or friend, and the hundreds of Marriott colleagues who are at this \nminute quarantined. Our well wishes and thoughts are with all of you. \nIn terms of our business, COVID-19 is like nothing we’ve ever seen before. For a company that’s 92 years old, that’s borne wit-\nness to the Great Depression, WWII, and many other economic and global crises, that’s saying something.\nBut here are the facts. COVID-19 is having a more severe and sudden financial impact on our business than 9/11 and the 2009 \nfinancial crisis, combined. The worst quarter we had in those earlier crises saw a roughly 25 percent decline in hotel revenues, \non average, across the globe. In this case, which began in Greater China in January, we quickly saw a 90 percent decline in our \nbusiness in China. In the two months since, we have seen COVID-19 extend to the rest of the world. In most markets, our busi-\nness is already running 75 percent below normal levels. \nThe principal challenge we face is obvious. Governments all around the world are taking the steps to contain COVID-19. The \nrestrictions on travel, gatherings of people, and required social distancing, is having an immediate impact by depressing \ndemand for our hotels. As a result, we have hotels around the world that can’t operate without incurring substantial economic \nlosses and risking permanently their ability to reopen when this gets behind us. This has caused hundreds of hotels to close or \nstart the process of closing until such time as demand begins to return. \nGiven these circumstances, we have been forced to take proactive steps to respond to the crisis and are putting into place busi-\nness contingency plans, globally. While pieces of these continent contingency plans vary, given the differences in local laws in \nthe geographies where we operate, certain elements are universal. \nWe’ve worked to take controllable costs out of the business, like suspending all nonessential travel. We have paused all new \nhires, with the exception of a small number of mission-critical positions. We have stopped all hotel initiatives for 2020 and have \ngone dark on our brand marketing and advertising during this period. Both Mr. Marriott and I will not be taking any salary for \nthe balance of 2020 and my executive team will be taking a 50 percent cut in pay. \nAbove property around the world, we are moving to shortened work weeks and in the US we are also putting in place tem-\nporary leaves for at least the next 60 to 90 days that will impact most associates at our headquarters and above-property \nlocations. At the property level, contingency plans vary by geography and hotel occupancy rates, but for open hotels, include \nclosing food and beverage outlets, reducing staff and closing floors of hotels. More details about these actions and what they \nmean will be shared through local HR teams. \nIf there is any good news visible today, it is the signs of early recovery in Greater China. China appears to have succeeded in \nreducing the spread of COVID-19 through strong counteractions. China is now bringing manufacturing back online, and we \nare seeing some early signs of lodging demand begin to return. If this holds, it may bode well for the course of this epidemic in \nother parts of the world. \nIn two weeks, I will mark my eighth anniversary as CEO, a position I accepted on the heels of two legends in hospitality. As a \nleader, I have experienced so many wonderful highs and a good number of challenging lows. I can tell you that I have never \nhad a more difficult moment than this one. [gets choked up]\nThere is simply nothing worse than telling highly valued associates, people who are the very heart of this company, that their \nroles are being impacted by events completely outside of their control. I have never been more determined to see us through \nthan I am at this moment. \nWhile it is impossible to know how long this crisis will last, I know we as a global community will come through the other side \nand that when we do, our guests will be eager to travel this beautiful world again. When that great day comes, we will be there \nto welcome them, with the warmth and care we are known for the world over. \nAs I close, I encourage you to please take care of yourself, your friends and family, and the community around you.

Nevertheless, the pressures on the industry were truly \nunprecedented. An already-turbulent industry evolution, \ncomplicated by the massive societal impact of COVID-19, \nmade the future unclear, both for Marriott and for the larger \nindustry. How do you plan for a future that is so uncertain?\nMarriott International: A History  \nof Continuous Reinvention\nJohn Willard Marriott and his wife Alice opened the first A&W \nroot beer franchise in Washington, DC, on May 20, 1927. The \ncouple grew that business into several full-service restaurants \nunder the name Hot Shoppe throughout the Washington, DC, \narea. Constantly looking for ways to enhance his offerings, Mar-\nriott purchased a vacant lot adjacent to one of the Hot Shoppe \nlocations and opened the first drive-in service restaurant on the \nEast Coast. Its instant success led to the addition of drive-in \nservices at all three of Marriott’s Hot Shoppe locales. Later, he \nnoticed that customers often stopped by on their way to the air-\nport to pick up a boxed lunch to eat on their flight, so Marriott \nexpanded into airline catering. By 1953, what had started out as \na modest nine-seat root beer stand on 14th Street had grown to \n56 restaurants that served 30 million customers per year. In that \nsame year, 1953, Marriott decided to take his company public \nunder the name Hot Shoppes, Inc. The initial offering was priced \nat $10.25 per share and sold out within two hours of trading. \nIn 1957, under the management of J. Willard Marriott’s \nson, J.W. Marriott, Jr. (Bill), the world’s first motor hotel was \nestablished in Arlington, Virginia. Over the ensuing years, the \ncompany continued to diversify its interests in the hotel and \nrestaurant business, acquiring the Big Boy and Roy Rogers \nfamily restaurant chains in the late 1960s and Farrell’s Ice \nCream Parlour in 1972. The company even expanded into \ntheme parks, opening Marriott’s Great America in California \nand Illinois, and to cruise ships, partnering with Sun Line to \nbecome the first lodging company to enter the cruise business. \nIn 1964, Bill was appointed president of the company and \nhe became CEO in 1972; the company changed its name from \nHot Shoppes, Inc., to Marriott Corp. in 1967.5 During his \nearly tenure, Bill witnessed a meaningful increase in travel \nthat accompanied the expansion of the US interstate highway \nsystem and the introduction of the “Jumbo Jet” in the early \n1970s, opening up the skies for millions of people who pre-\nviously could not afford to travel by air. With travel trending \nupward, Bill identified an opportunity to build out the com-\npany’s hotel business, opening 32 new hotels by 1975.\nUnder Bill’s leadership and in true Marriott fashion, the \ncompany began yet another reinvention process, shifting \nits hotel business model from hotel ownership to property \nmanagement and franchising. Under this model, Marriott \nwould no longer own the hotels, but rather the company \nwould provide its Marriott brand name and services to third-\nparty owners who would pay Marriott a management or \nfranchising fee in return. Although the decision to shift busi-\nness models was initially driven by the company’s strained \nbalance sheet, including cash flow issues brought on by the \n1976 recession, it ultimately proved to be a prudent move that \nwould forever change the company. The innovative decision \nto pursue an “asset-light” strategy relieved Marriott of much \nof the heavy capital investment that had previously been \nrequired, which in turn accelerated its hotel expansion plans, \ngenerated significant and stable cash flow, improved return \non capital, reduced its debt burden, and solidified Marriott’s \nleading position within the industry.\nIn the early 1980s, Bill began the process of expanding \nMarriott’s portfolio of brands, each focusing on different seg-\nments of the hospitality market. In 1983, Marriott debuted \nthe Courtyard by Marriott hotel, which offered lodging for \nbusiness travelers and marked the first time a major hotel \ncompany had gone “down market” in its offerings. The next \nyear brought the addition of JW Marriott, a luxury offering \nnamed in honor of Bill’s father. With the opening of the first \nFairfield Inn and Marriott Suites hotels in 1987, Marriott offi-\ncially became the first lodging company to offer an exten-\nsive portfolio of brands to its customers. Marriott also served \nas a pioneer in the extended-stay business, acquiring the \nResidence Inn brand in 1987. \nThe business transformation that Bill had initiated in the \n1970s culminated in the company’s split in 1993 into Marriott \nInternational, the hotel management and franchising company \nheaded by Bill, and Host Marriott International, a hotel own-\nership company led by his brother, Richard Marriott. Having \ndivested from all divisions that fell outside Marriott’s core hotel \nbusiness, Bill was able to devote his full attention to his quest \nto become the number-one hospitality company in the world. \nWhen Bill reached his 80th birthday in 2012, he stepped \ndown as CEO and turned the reins over to Sorenson, the \nfirst non–family member to hold this position. Sorenson \nhad joined Marriott in 1996 as a general counsel focused on \nM&A, eventually serving as president and COO for three \nyears prior to his CEO promotion. In 2016, pursuant to his \nM&A roots, Sorenson led the successful acquisition of Star-\nwood Hotels & Resorts for $13.6 billion, adding 11 new brands \nto Marriott’s portfolio. The acquisition not only doubled \nMarriott’s presence outside the United States, but it also made \nMarriott the largest hotel company in the world, with more \nthan 5,800 properties and 1.1 million rooms in over 110 coun-\ntries—that equated to 1 out of every 15 hotel rooms across the \nglobe. According to Sorenson, Starwood’s diverse collection \nof brands was a key driver of the acquisition: “We’ve got an \nability to offer just that much more choice. A choice in loca-\ntions, a choice in the kind of hotel, a choice in the amount a \ncustomer needs to spend.”6 By the start of 2020, three years \ninto the Starwood integration, Marriott operated in 134 \ncountries and boasted a compelling collection of 30 brands  \n(see Exhibit 2 for a breakdown of its full brand portfolio).7\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

As travel \nevolved over those 50 years, the expectations of the modern \ntraveler also became more complex and sophisticated. Gone \nwere the days when guests were content to find bathrobes \nand stocked minibars in their hotel rooms. The traveler of \n2019 expected modern and authentically designed rooms, \nequipped with the latest technology, as well as personalized \nand high-quality services. Moreover, in recent years there \nhad been a meaningful shift in focus across the hospitality \nindustry to experiences over products, driven primarily by \nmillennials and Gen Xers, who were set to enter their peak \ntravel years and comprise a majority of worldwide travelers. \nThe hospitality industry had evolved to meet the preferences \nand demands of the modern traveler, embracing new busi-\nness models, technologies, and ways to personalize offerings. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

However, from a property standpoint, \nthe Wyndham Hotel Group portfolio was the industry leader, \nwith over 9,000 properties worldwide in its portfolio (see \nExhibit 3 for largest hotel companies by room, property, and \ncountries of operations). There were considerable regional \ndifferences that affected how hoteliers, both large and small, \npositioned themselves to succeed. Affiliation with a national \nor regional brand via franchise or management agreement \nhad remained the dominant model within the United States, \nas approximately 72% of all US hotel rooms were brand \naffiliated.14 Looking outside the United States, however, brand \naffiliation was significantly less common. Most international \nmarkets had historically been composed of smaller hotel \nchains and independent operators, though this appeared to \nbe changing as the larger hoteliers had experienced greater \nconsolidation in recent years.15 In keeping with these trends, \nMarriott held approximately 16% of the US market share \n(based on number of rooms), while it maintained less than \n4% market share outside the United States in 2019. \nThe hotel industry had long been characterized by \nits cyclical nature, with periods of rapid hotel expansion \nand development followed by periods of adjustment and \nrecovery. Demand for hotel rooms generally tracked with \nbroader macroeconomic trends, with financial downturns \nand other global, national, or regional conditions impacting \nthe industry’s financial results and growth. During the Great \nRecession of 2007–9, for example, demand for hotel rooms \ndropped significantly from its peak in 2007, forcing many \nof the major hotel players to pursue operational cost cuts \nand efficiency measures. As the industry rebounded from \nthis crisis, hotel demand grew steadily every subsequent year \nin the United States, leading to a record-setting expansion \nphase in which demand for rooms outpaced supply growth \nfrom 2010 through 2018. Historically, room supply growth \nhad served as an indicator of the attractiveness of the hotel \nindustry from an investor’s perspective. In 2019 alone, there \nwere 200,000 rooms in the global construction pipeline, \nled by Marriott, which controlled 19% of these projects. In \naddition to economic cyclicality, global hotel brands faced \nmeaningful risk from a wide variety of other sources, \nincluding cyberattacks and fraud, natural disasters, changes \nin governmental or travel policies, and geopolitical tension. \nDisruption in the Hospitality Industry \nThe three decades beginning in the 1990s was a period of sub-\nstantial change and disruption across the hospitality industry. \nThe emergence of the internet in the late 1990s introduced \ntravel-related e-commerce sites, such as Expedia and Price-\nline, and social networks, such as TripAdvisor. These indus-\ntry innovations had a meaningful impact on consumers and \nFigure I Geographic breakdown of global hotel room revenues (2019).\nSource: Unless otherwise noted, all figures created by authors.\nPercent of Hotel Room\nRevenue \nGreater\nChina\n9.1%\nAmericas\n39.9%\nRest of the World\n51.0%\nFigure 2 Global hotel industry rooms by price segment (2019).\nLuxury\n6.2% \nEconomy\n19.4%\nMidscale\n12.9%\nUpper\nmidscale\n23.7%\nUpscale\n22.1%\nUpper\nupscale\n15.7%\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The “shar-\ning economy” brought more changes in the mid-2000s, with \ncompanies like Airbnb and HomeAway taking the hospitality \nmarket by storm and proving to be huge industry disruptors. \nMore recently, the advent of the “experience economy” found \ncustomers favoring experiences over material possessions, \nleading them to look for more personalized, unique, and \nauthentic experiences while traveling, with hotels as primary \nproviders or brokers of these experiences. \nOnline Travel Agencies\nIn October 1996, Microsoft launched what was then called \nMicrosoft Expedia Travel Services, the world’s first online \ntravel agency (OTA). Although the product premiered during \nthe internet’s early days, it would have a lasting impact on \nthe way consumers researched, planned, and booked their \ntravel, including hotel reservations. Priceline was launched a \nyear later, its founders having been inspired by the idea that \nthey could use the internet to drive demand to fill what they \nbelieved to be millions of empty hotel rooms and airline seats. \nThe emergence of OTAs revolutionized personal travel, \ntransforming what had previously been a complex and \nfrustrating task into a much more accessible, flexible, and \neven fun experience for those looking to book their own \ntravel. OTAs introduced comparison shopping and price \ntransparency, giving customers the ability to browse and \nbook hotels, flights, rental cars, and other travel-related \nservices. Consumers liked the convenience of OTAs, which \nprovided a comprehensive centralized marketplace for a wide \nrange of travel needs, allowing travelers to compare options \nacross brands and bundle different travel services (e.g., flight, \nhotel, and rental car) together. Some recognized OTAs as \nthe “original digital disruptors,” as these companies were \nfirst-generation internet businesses that identified an unmet \ncustomer need and created digital solutions that became the \nfirst stop for prospective travelers. These platforms were able \nto aggregate and digitize data to create economical, do-it-\nyourself travel planning, a concept that was unheard of before \ntheir launch.16 \nThe immediate success of OTAs led to a period of \nincredible growth for both the travel industry and the OTAs \nthemselves. The relationship between hotel owners and \nOTAs had long been a marriage of convenience, each party \ndepending on the other to help drive profitability across \ntheir businesses. Over the last two decades, the OTA sector \nexperienced massive consolidation, which continued to shift \nthe balance of power in the hotel-OTA relationship.

Expedia’s \ncompany umbrella included Hotels.com, Orbitz, Travelocity, \nand HomeAway, which the company had acquired in 2015 \nfor $3.9  billion. The Booking Holdings business was also \ncomposed of a collection of brands, including Booking.com, \nPriceline, Agoda, Kayak, and OpenTable, which it acquired in \n2014 for $2.6 billion. \nBooking Holdings entered 2020 as the world leader for \nbooking online accommodation reservations, reporting an \n11% annual increase in room nights booked (to 845 million) \nacross the 2.58 million properties listed in over 230 countries \non its platform in 2019. Expedia trailed with 389  million \nroom nights booked, which reflected about 70% of its total \nworldwide revenue in 2019. Global travel market research firm \nPhocuswright predicted that hotel bookings via OTAs would \ngrow to approximately 25% by 2022, presenting a clear threat \nto many of the large hotelier’s direct booking businesses.17 \nIndeed, Marriott’s relationship to OTAs embodied the \ntypical hotel “frenemy” dynamic: the consolidated OTAs \nhelped increase hotel occupancy by funneling customers to \nthe company’s properties, but they also exerted powerful \nmarket pressure. Not only were Marriott’s margins lower \nfrom business generated by OTAs, but the OTAs undermined \nMarriott’s value proposition to its hotel property owners, \nwho regularly looked to Expedia and Booking Holdings \nto fill gaps between reservations generated from Marriott’s \ninternal systems. Hotel owners were required to pay a fee to \nthe OTA for every room it booked in addition to the standard \nmanagement or franchise fee they paid to Marriott for similar \nservices. As such, Marriott needed to prevent hotel owners \nfrom shifting to work exclusively with OTAs for booking \nservices, potentially dropping Marriott and its respective \nservices and fees. \nMarriott’s scale—particularly after its merger with \nStarwood—gave it increased bargaining power with OTAs, \nsomething highly desirable given the recent shifts in power \nacross the hospitality industry. In a maneuver designed to \nreduce distribution costs and further weaken OTAs, Marriott \nfollowed Hilton’s lead and introduced a number of new \nstrategies and campaigns to drive consumers toward its direct \nbooking channels. In 2015, as OTAs continued to take share \nof room bookings—OTAs were booking 8% of rooms, up \nfrom 4% only four years earlier18—Marriott launched its “It \nPays to Book Direct” marketing campaign to drive customer \nawareness around the benefits of Marriott’s direct booking \nchannels and loyalty membership programs, including its \nBest Rate Guarantee. In 2016, Marriott introduced Marriott \nRewards Members Rates, an exclusive rate for its loyalty \nmembers who booked directly through Marriott’s online, \ncall center, or app channels. Additionally, Marriott allowed \nits loyalty members to earn points only for direct bookings, \nnot for those made through an OTA. While these strategies \nproved successful, Marriott went a step further in 2018, when \nits contract with Expedia was up for renegotiation. Marriott \nhad historically paid Expedia a commission fee of about 12%, \nbut it aimed to negotiate the fee downward; the company \nwas the first hotelier to directly take on one of the major \nOTAs. This was possible not only due to Marriott’s size, \nbut also because of the value of Marriott’s now-combined \nloyalty program; indeed the acquisition of Starwood’s guest \nloyalty program, Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG), had been \na “central, strategic rationale for the transaction” in the first \nplace.19 The acquisition merged Marriott’s two legacy loyalty \nprograms, Marriott Rewards and Ritz-Carlton Rewards (with \nover 57  million combined members) with the industry-\nleading SPG program (21  million members) under one \ncomprehensive umbrella, Bonvoy, making it one of the largest \nand most comprehensive loyalty programs in the world, with \nover 110 million members. This increased Marriott’s leverage. \nIn April 2019, Marriott and Expedia announced they had \nreached a new multiyear agreement that satisfied both parties.\nBonvoy was perceived as the industry-leading loyalty \nprogram. It rewarded members with points that could be \nused toward free hotel stays across Marriott’s entire portfolio \nof brands, “from overwater bungalows, to mountainside ski \nresorts, to iconic urban landmarks.”20 Travel experiences \nthrough the company’s Marriott Bonvoy Tours and Activities \nprogram were also available, as were miles with participating \nairlines, among other benefits. Following the unification of \nthe three programs, members could earn, on average, 20% \nmore points per dollar spent and achieve Elite Status faster \nthan before. Marriott’s loyalty program had driven substantial \nrepeat business for the company, with members booking over \n50% of all room nights in 2019. Marriott’s direct relationship \nand interactions with its Bonvoy members allowed the \ncompany to collect massive amounts of data on its guests’ \nbehavior and preferences, which it was prevented from doing \nwhen customers booked with an OTA. As guests increasingly \ncame to expect personalized offerings during their hotel stays, \nMarriott could operationalize these data insights to create \ncustomized and seamless experiences for guests. In 2018, \nLinnartz shared her thoughts on the evolution of Marriott’s \nloyalty program: \nGuests are willing to give us information about them-\nselves, and they expect that we use it to enhance their \nexperience. Whether it is preference in pillow type or rec-\nommendations for local experiences once they’ve arrived \nat the destination, they expect us to leverage the infor-\nmation they’ve provided to personalize their experience \nand anticipate their needs. That is how we build loyalty \nand strengthen the relationship between our company \nand our guests.21\nMarriott also offered loyalty members access to its \nexperiential platform called Marriott Bonvoy Moments, where \nmembers could apply their points to 120,000 experiences \nacross 1,000 global destinations. Members could choose from \na wide variety of cooking, entertainment, sports, and other \nonce-in-a-lifetime cultural experiences, powered through \npartnerships that Marriott established with brands such as \nthe National Football League (NFL), New York’s Madison \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

These perks constituted the primary way \nMarriott worked to entice customers away from using OTAs.\nNevertheless, the OTA market was poised for more \ndisruption, as new powerhouse competitors continued to \nenter the fray. In recent years, Google had been slowly building \nup its own travel brand, which was second behind Expedia \nas the go-to option for travel search. In May 2019, Google \nrevealed its streamlined travel-planning platform, Google \nTravel, which consolidated Google Flights, Google Hotels, \nand its other services under one comprehensive booking \nsite. Google stood to benefit from the immense amount of \ndata it already possessed from its users, accrued from Google \ninternet search, Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Maps, \nwhich put Google in a prime position to provide personalized \nofferings and experiences, with research, itineraries, and \nreservations all housed under one roof. As the importance \nof user data intensified, it was possible that other large tech \ncompanies with substantial treasure troves of detailed user \ndata—like Amazon, Facebook, or Apple—would pose future \ncompetitive threats in the industry, though these companies \nhad not yet made significant investments in this space nor \nhad they announced plans to do so.22\nThe Rise of the Homesharing Economy \nand Airbnb \nThe “sharing economy” described a transformative, massive \nsocietal and economic shift that emerged in part due to the \nspread of internet-based technologies and social networks, \nresulting in online community marketplaces built around \nthe sharing or temporary exchange of resources, such as \nrooms, services, skills, or cars. This concept quickly sparked \nthe launch of start-up businesses structured around this eco-\nnomic model; in the hospitality sector, Airbnb most success-\nfully capitalized on the idea of sharing temporary accommo-\ndations. Airbnb was founded in 2007 by Brian Chesky, Joe \nGebbia, and Nathan Blecharczy, and by 2011 it had achieved \ncoveted “unicorn” status, reaching a valuation of over $1 bil-\nlion. What began as a “way to make a few extra bucks” evolved \ninto one of the world’s largest two-sided marketplaces, \nbecoming a formidable enterprise with more than 7  mil-\nlion listings in over 100,000 cities across 220 countries and \nregions,23 creating a new segment that prompted the launch \nof several other successful home-sharing competitors, includ-\ning VRBO, Homestay, FlipKey (owned by TripAdvisor), and \nVacasa. Airbnb quickly expanded beyond its initial business \nof room rentals to offer full apartments, homes, villas, and \nother unique vacation rentals, as well as localized experiences \nfor its guests; for instance, as of mid-2020, there were over \n29,000 tiny houses, 5,000 castles, and 3,000 treehouses listed \non Airbnb. Airbnb has accommodated over 400  million \nguests at an average rate of $100 per night, with its hosts earn-\ning over $80 billion.24 Airbnb at one point received a private \nvaluation of $38 billion, at the time exceeding that of Expedia \n($15.4 billion) and Hilton ($30.9 billion), but falling behind \nBooking Holdings ($85 billion) and Marriott ($49 billion). \nHowever, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated \nan emergency round of additional funding for Airbnb, with \nits valuation in April 2020 almost halved to $18 billion.25 Nev-\nertheless a surge in summer 2020 bookings put Airbnb on \ntrack for an S-1 filing scheduled for November 2020, 26 sug-\ngesting an IPO with proceeds of $3 billion and a valuation \nthat could once again exceed $30 billion.27\nUnlike hoteliers, home-sharing platforms did not \nprovide the actual accommodation service or make any \ncapital investments in real estate or hotel assets. Instead—in \nmuch the same way ridesharing app Uber matched riders \nand drivers—these platforms simply connected guests with \nprivate providers of accommodations. By leveraging search \nand matching algorithms to help users quickly sort through \nand select their desired listing, companies like Airbnb served \nas booking services for guests and clearinghouses for the \nassociated economic transactions, processing all payments \nbetween guests and hosts. Airbnb’s platform was free to access \nfor guests and hosts alike, creating strong network effects \nand helping the company quickly generate a significant user \nbase. Airbnb collected service and commission fees from \nboth guests and hosts. Based on the type of reservation they \nmade, guests were charged a nonrefundable service fee that \ntypically fell under 14.2% of the booking transaction price. \nHosts were typically charged a 3% to 5% commission fee, \nand Airbnb also offered its hosts access to “smart” pricing \nanalytics, providing them with optimal data-driven rate \nrecommendations. \nBecause Airbnb’s platform offered such a wide variety \nof accommodations, most of them listed by hosts who were \nnew to the hospitality sector, transparency and accuracy \nwere vital in managing guest and host expectations. Airbnb \nimplemented a number of features to help build community \ntrust, including professional photographs for listings and a \nrobust profile and review system. In addition, guests and \nhosts could get to know one another prior to their reservation \nvia detailed profile information and a messaging platform. \nFollowing their stays, guests and hosts provided feedback on \neach other, with guests rating the accommodation’s features, \ncleanliness, and truth in advertising, and property owners \nrating the courtesy of guests. Airbnb maintained complete \ncontrol over all payment processing and did not pay hosts \nuntil 24 hours after guest check-in, providing a safeguard for \ndisputes. This approach essentially “crowdsourced” quality \ncontrol and the enforcement of standards, functionality that \nhad traditionally fallen on hotels to perform. By 2019, Airbnb \nhosts and guests had left over 250 million reviews, which the \ncompany referred to as a “currency of trust that cannot be \nreplicated.”28 \nAirbnb’s initial launch was largely geared toward a \nniche segment of leisure travelers who were looking for \naffordable, localized alternatives to a traditional hotel. Many \nof these users were budget-conscious travelers and belonged \nto the tech-savvy millennial and Gen-Z generations. They \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

However, according to Airbnb data from 2016, \nan Airbnb was generally cheaper than a hotel room in 7 of \nthe 12 major US cities.29 In addition, Airbnb hosts tended \nto accommodate guests for longer stays than hotels did. For \nexample, in New York City, Airbnb data showed that Airbnb \nguests stayed, on average, 2.5 days longer than hotel guests \nin 2017.30 By 2019, 53% of Airbnb guests were female, and its \naverage guest was 35 years old; these figures contrasted with \nthose of the traditional hotel industry, whose average guests \ntended to skew older and more male. While the millennial \ndemographic still comprised Airbnb’s largest pool of hosts \nand guests at 58%, the company had made a concerted effort \nto broaden its user base, targeting young families, high-end \ntravelers, and even the business segment. These efforts proved \nfruitful, with Airbnb capturing nearly 20% of all US consumer \nspending on lodging during 2018, driven by a staggering 30% \ngrowth that year in Airbnb revenue in the United States; while \nfalling short of consumer spending at Marriott, this exceeded \nwhat consumers spent on Hilton and its subsidiary brands \nthat year. The US market had the most Airbnb listings at \n660,000, followed by France (485,000), Italy (340,000), Spain \n(245,000), and the United Kingdom (175,000); and guests \ncould find listings in 98% of the world’s nations.31 Within \ncountries, geographic market penetration varied significantly; \nin the United States, New York, Seattle, Washington, DC, New \nOrleans, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Denver were major \nmarkets, with other markets having fewer listings. \nAirbnb had also made significant investments to \nposition itself for growth. Specifically, it launched several \nnew initiatives and offerings, including Airbnb Experiences, \none-of-a-kind local activities that immersed guests in the \nhost’s unique world. Airbnb for Work represented its effort \nto tap into the robust business-travel market, and it was an \nimmediate success, accounting for 18% of bookings by 2018. \nAirbnb Plus constituted a new premium tier that was added \nto the platform following the company’s 2017 acquisition \nof Montreal-based Luxury Retreats, and along with Airbnb \nLuxe, provided travelers with access to handpicked homes \nand villas across the world, each with its own 300-point \nchecklist. The company even expanded into the boutique and \nindependent hotel space with its acquisition of HotelTonight \nfor approximately $400  million in 2019. By expanding its \ncore offerings, Airbnb sought to attract travelers who might \nnot initially have considered the home-sharing platform’s \ntraditional options but who would typically have opted to \nstay at a luxury hotel. Airbnb’s extension into luxury was \nalso intended to elevate the experiences of Airbnb’s existing \nnetwork of users, who, the company perceived, were “growing \nup. Someone who was sharing homes for under $100 a night \nwhen they started with Airbnb is now booking places that are \n$1,000 a night.”32\nAs a pioneer in the home-sharing market, Airbnb initially \noperated in a regulatory gray area. While traditional hotels \nhad long been required to adhere to regulatory requirements \nincluding zoning laws, occupancy or lodging taxes, and safety \nand accessibility standards, Airbnb was initially able to skirt \naround many of these requirements. However, as it grew, \nmany municipalities became concerned about the company’s \neffect on vacancy rates and affordability in residential rental \nmarkets, not to mention the lost tax revenue due to Airbnb’s \nshirking of regulations. Many regulators introduced new \nmeasures deterring property owners from offering short-\nterm rentals. After initially fighting this oversight, Airbnb \neventually worked to create solutions that satisfied these \nstakeholders. By the end of 2019, the company had reached \na landmark cumulative $2  billion in tourist-related taxes \ncollected and remitted to local governments on behalf of its \nglobal host community over the previous four years. Airbnb \nalso worked to establish more than 400 agreements with local, \nstate, territorial, and national governments to streamline and \nfacilitate tax collection for hosts. \nHome-sharing platforms were not initially viewed as \na competitive threat to major players in the hospitality \nindustry; even as late as 2017, Marriott’s CEO Sorenson had \nsuggested that “so far, the impact of Airbnb has not been \nprofound to our business. In many respects, they are selling a \ndifferent product.”33 However, as Airbnb’s remarkable growth \ncontinued, this dismissal rapidly melted away and hoteliers \ninstead began to see Airbnb and the entire emerging sector \nas a hallmark of the rapidly evolving hospitality industry, \nrepresenting a source of both competitive worry and potential \ninnovation. Sorenson himself came to recognize Marriott’s \nopportunity within this changing landscape: \nWith 30 brands and 6,000 hotels in 120 countries and \nloyalty programs, how do you create an ecosystem of \ncustomers that basically say “I really don’t need to go \nanywhere else. I don’t need to go to Expedia. I don’t \nneed to go to Hilton. I don’t need to go to Airbnb \nbecause no matter where I’m going, you’re going to have \na range of choices for me, and I know you’re going to \ntake care of me.”34\nHomes & Villas by Marriott \nAs Marriott continued to seek new ways to compete in the \nevolving hospitality industry, in 2019 Linnartz spearheaded \nthe launch of Homes & Villas by Marriott, a premium home-\nrental platform that served as a natural extension of Marriott’s \ncore hotel business. Marriott’s decision to expand into this \ncomplementary space was the result of Linnartz’s success-\nful 2018 pilot program in Europe under its brand extension, \nTribute Portfolio Homes. Through the pilot program, which \noffered 500 home rentals in select European locales, Marriott \nlearned that 90% of its guests were members of Bonvoy and \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Moreover, the average pilot program guest stayed for \nfive nights or more, which was more than triple the average \n1.5-night stay in Marriott’s traditional hotels. Linnartz had \nalso led a survey of Marriott’s most loyal customers regarding \ntheir engagement with the home rental market, and discov-\nered that 30% of those polled had stayed in a home rental \nduring the prior year, typically for events that were better \nsuited to entire homes than traditional hotel rooms, such as \nbachelorette parties or family reunions.35 Together, the survey \ninsights and success of the European pilot program served to \nalleviate internal worries that Homes & Villas would canni-\nbalize Marriott’s core hotel business. As Linnartz explained, \npeople experienced “different trip purposes. Sometimes it’s a \ncool weekend with friends at a beach house and then a kid’s \nsoccer tournament and you need a Courtyard. Home sharing \nis another offering.”36\nUnder Linnartz’s leadership, Marriott decided to \ndifferentiate Homes & Villas offerings from other established \nplayers by competing only in the premium and luxury space. \nWhile Airbnb and VRBO were known to offer everything \nfrom luxury beach houses to tree houses to funky shacks, \nMarriott focused only on high-end properties run by third-\nparty hospitality management companies (HMCs) that were \nresponsible for vetting new homes and locations, in addition \nto managing on-site logistics to ensure the guest experience \nwould meet Marriott’s strict standards of quality and service. \nSpecifically, the HMCs were tasked with providing guests with \na professionally cleaned home, along with 24/7 support, high-\nspeed Wi-Fi, luxe linens, and amenities. Linnartz hoped to \ncreate a Marriott “ecosystem” that would meet all the varying \nneeds of its guests—leisure and business travelers alike. Rather \nthan looking to Airbnb or Expedia for their short-term rental \nneeds, guests could simply access the Homes & Villas section \nof Marriott’s website to search for their desired housing \naccommodations. Linnartz explained the company’s decision \nin simple terms: “It will all be connected and interrelated,”37 \nand “we actually believe it is complementary and additive to \nour core business.”38 Based on insights gleaned from the 2018 \npilot program and survey, Linnartz also felt it was crucial \nto integrate the Homes & Villas offering into the Bonvoy \nrewards program to further strengthen loyalty among its \nmembers. Under Linnartz’s direction, Marriott allowed its \nBonvoy members to apply their earned points toward villa \nstays as well as other experiential reward offerings like \ncooking classes, tours, and concerts. \nBy the end of 2019, Marriott offered more than 6,000 \nhomes in over 190 locations around the world, many in places \nwhere Marriott did not currently operate a hotel. Guests \nhad their choice of a variety of accommodations, including \na six-bedroom villa in Sorrento, Italy, with an infinity pool \noverlooking the Mediterranean Sea; an oceanfront villa in \nAnguilla with a private beach and a personal butler and \nhouse staff; and even an 18th-century Irish castle that slept \n17 and featured a private lake for boating and fishing.39 Based \non her extensive experience in the hospitality business and \nher understanding of evolving consumer trends, Linnartz \nfelt confident that this was a crucial investment that would \nposition Marriott to succeed in the future and remain \ncompetitive against players like Airbnb. Linnartz had also \nwitnessed Marriott’s traditional competitors such as Hyatt \nand AccorHotels struggle to succeed in home sharing, and \nshe was committed to making Marriott the first traditional \nhotel company to profit from this space. \nCOVID-19: The Black Swan Event  \nof 2020 \nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) \nofficially declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a global \npandemic. The pandemic quickly brought the world to a \ncomplete standstill: countries closed their borders, hospital \nsystems were pushed to the brink of collapse, and the global \neconomy experienced the most dramatic recession in over \nhalf a century. Despite governments’ efforts to inject stim-\nulus into the global economy, the pandemic forced many \nbusinesses to suspend operations or permanently shut down, \nderailing employees’ careers and often leaving them without \nincome. For instance, the unemployment rate in the United \nStates alone rose from 3.8% in February 2020 to 14.7% by \nApril 2020. By June, nearly 33 million Americans were receiv-\ning jobless benefits; this was roughly five times the number \nreceiving jobless benefits during the peak of the Great Reces-\nsion of 2007–9. Similar effects unfolded all around the world, \ncreating an unprecedented medical, social, and economic \ncrisis. COVID-19 emerged as an extraordinarily high-impact \n“black swan” event, forcing companies across the world to \nrethink the way they did business and transforming entire \nglobal industries. Although the virus affected every industry \nacross the globe, the hospitality sector was undoubtedly one \nof the hardest hit. The pandemic represented a “critical junc-\nture” for the industry,40 as the dramatic reduction of revenue \nposed an existential threat.\nAs part of a US government-sponsored COVID-19 relief \npackage, more than 8,100 hotel businesses across the country \nreceived federal funding of $150,000 or more. In addition \nto supporting individual hospitality properties, relief \nfunds also went to hotel owners, management companies, \nand hospitality-related start-ups such as Softbank-backed \nOYO Hotels. In total, 81 lodging borrowers received loans \nof $5  million or more, and another 1,200 received loans \nranging from $2  million to $5  million, all in an effort to \nretain hospitality workers and keep hotel properties afloat \n(see Exhibit 4). However, in a May 2020 survey conducted by \nthe American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA), over \n50% of respondents reported that the loan amount received \nwas not enough to rehire their staff, and with little to no \nrevenue expected, many operators anticipated permanent \nhotel closings and job losses.41 An April 2020 AHLA report \nindicated that 70% of hotel employees had been laid off or \nfurloughed, as 8 in 10 hotel rooms across the United States \nremained empty.

As consumers planned for a prolonged period of \nfinancial uncertainty, a McKinsey global study released in \nJuly 2020 found that most individuals intended to continue to \nshift their spending largely to essentials, such as grocery and \nhousehold supplies, while planning to substantially cut back \non most discretionary categories including hotel and travel.43 \nConsequently, airlines had taken a major hit in business along \nwith hotels; forecasters estimated that airlines were unlikely \nto see a return to 2019 passenger volumes until at least 2023 \nor 2024. In the near term, the industry was expected to \ncontinue burning cash, due to rising debt service pressures \nand depressed ticket sales. \nThe extent to which previous patterns of travel and \nhospitality would return was highly uncertain, and any \nrecovery experienced was expected to be uneven across \nsegments and more prolonged compared to many other \nindustries. For instance, business and leisure travel would \nundoubtedly recover at different speeds, as would domestic \nand international travel. Demand for business travel was \nprojected to return sporadically, as companies attempted \nto revise their policies for both nonessential and essential \ntravel and many companies across the globe shifted to \nvideo-conferencing instead of nonessential travel; given the \nsudden forced shift in workplace dynamics, some forecasters \nanticipated that certain types of business travel would never \nreturn to pre-COVID-19 levels. \nMarriott’s Path Forward \nSince the virus’s initial outbreak, Marriott had been forced to \ntake a number of radical but proactive steps to mitigate the \nsevere financial and operational impacts of COVID-19 on the \nbusiness; the company ended the first quarter of 2020 with \n$12.23 billion in debt and $1.76 billion in cash. In order to \nstrengthen its business and significantly reduce costs, Marriott \nannounced in mid-March that it would implement reduced \nwork-week schedules while also placing approximately two-\nthirds of its 174,000 worldwide employees on furlough for \nthe following 60–90 days. This amounted to roughly 115,000 \nassociates—at corporate headquarters and at Marriott’s hotel \nproperties—who would not be paid salaries but would still \nretain health care benefits. On May 27, Marriott extended \nthese initial measures and furloughs, which remained in \nplace through October 2020. In other cost-cutting measures, \nthe company suspended all nonessential travel, paused all \nnew hires, and blocked all hotel initiatives for 2020, includ-\ning its brand marketing and advertising programs. Sorenson \nand Bill also reported that they would not take a salary for the \nbalance of 2020, and the executive team would receive a 50% \npay cut for the year. Marriott estimated these measures would \nreduce 2020 corporate general and administrative costs by at \nleast $140 million. \nTo accommodate and support its guests, Marriott \nintroduced more flexible reservation policies, allowing \nchanges or cancellations up to 24 hours prior to arrival \nat no additional cost. The company also put in place a \nmultipronged approach designed to meet the health and safety \nchallenges of COVID-19. In early May, Marriott announced \nits “Commitment to Cleanliness” initiative, which included \nthe creation of the Marriott Global Cleanliness Council, the \nintroduction of new and advanced cleaning technologies \n(including electrostatic sprayers), and cleaning regimen \nchanges and contactless services to meet higher cleanliness \nstandards; the company stated in a press release that “our \nfounder, J.W. Marriott, used to personally inspect kitchens \nExhibit 5 US Hotel Occupancy Rates, 2019 versus 2020\nSource: Based on “AHLA Report: State of the Hotel Industry Analysis: COVID-19 Six Months Later,” American Hotel & Lodging Association, August 31, 2020, https://www.ahla.com/sites \n/default/files/State%20of%20the%20Industry.pdf (accessed Sept. 10, 2020).\n54.7%\n62.1%\n68.2%\n67.8%\n68.6%\n73.3%\n73.6%\n71.4%\n67.4%\n69.3%\n61.8%\n54.4%\n55.1%\n62.2%\n39.4%\n24.5%\n33.1%\n42.2%\n47.0%\n48.8%\n0\n2019\n2020\nJanuary\nFebruary\nMarch\nApril\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAugust\nSeptember\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

A high \nstandard of cleanliness is in our DNA.”44\nFor its Bonvoy members, Marriott worked quickly to \nadjust its program, announcing that it would extend the \nstatus its members earned in 2019 through February 2022, \npausing all point expirations until February 2021. It also \nintroduced a new offering to its online platform that allowed \nmembers to go on virtual tours of over 2,500 museums \nand galleries across the world, as well as explore cultural \nlandmarks and natural wonders such as the Great Wall of \nChina and the Sahara Desert via satellite and drone. For \nBonvoy members who were cobranded credit card holders, \nMarriott communicated such offerings as 6× points that \ncould be earned for grocery shopping, reminding members \nthat even when they weren’t traveling, the Bonvoy loyalty \nprogram could deliver significant benefits. \nIn terms of Marriott’s hotel operations, by the end of \nApril 2020, about 2,000 of its 7,3001 hotels across the world \nremained temporarily closed. Within the United States, \nroughly 1,000 of its 4,000 hotels were forced to suspend \noperations. For the properties that remained open, Marriott \nimplemented contingency plans that required the closing \nof food and beverage outlets, the reduction of hotel staff, \nand the closing of full floors. To support its franchise and \nmanagement affiliates, Marriott temporarily deferred the \nimplementation of most brand standards, including delaying \nrenovations due in 2020 by one year. It also took steps to \nsignificantly reduce the costs related to programs and services \nfor which its affiliates were obligated to reimburse it. \nBut all these initiatives were mostly geared toward a \ntriage-like response to the pandemic and oriented toward \nsurvival. While Linnartz was pleased with the contingency \nplans that the company had implemented in the early days of \nthe pandemic and was confident that the team would continue \nto adapt these plans to meet the evolving nature of the \npandemic, she was actually more concerned about Marriott’s \nuncertain future, given the uncharted territory that lay ahead \nfor the entire industry. How should the company position \nitself going forward? What did the future of hospitality hold, \nboth until the pandemic conditions improved and beyond? \nAirbnb CEO Brian Chesky had gone “on record” as saying \nthat “travel will never, ever go back to the way it was pre-\nCOVID; it just won’t.”45\nLinnartz thought about the challenging road that lay ahead \nfor the company. How could Marriott leverage the current \nand emerging constraints and trends to invent a new future \nfor itself and adapt to this rapidly evolving and uncertain \nenvironment? What options might the firm consider, and \nhow should it best prepare? What other measures should \nit take to support its guests and loyalty members and keep \nthem feeling safe and engaged with the Marriott brand? \nHow should she best work to position the company not only \nto survive today, but also to thrive in the uncertain hotel \nindustry of the future?\nNotes\n1. “J.

Facebook has arguably grown into one of the most \npowerful business entities in history. As of November 2021, its \nmarket capitalization stands at a towering $950 billion.\nHowever, storm clouds are approaching. On one hand, \nthe company faces repeat political scandals, and on the other, \nhaving signed up virtually every person on earth able to use \ntheir core social media product, the firm is approaching the \nupper boundary of what’s possible for organic growth. There \nis nobody left to sign up who is vaguely interested. Young \npeople especially reject Facebook outright, though they flock \nto the Facebook-owned Instagram social network.2\nIn the past, Facebook, like many companies, relied \npartly upon growth by acquisition. In 2012, they purchased \nInstagram for $1 billion, and in 2014, followed up by pur-\nchasing the messaging and video-calling app WhatsApp \nfor $19 billion and virtual reality goggle maker Oculus for  \n$2 billion. However, the wall against organic growth, coupled \nwith social and political problems, makes additional mean-\ningful growth by acquisition unlikely.\nIn response to these challenges, on October 29, 2021, \nFacebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced \na strategic pivot.3 He changed the business’s name to Meta \nand announced his intention to spend an initial $10 billion, \nand more in the future, to create a metaverse. “Our overar-\nching goal across all of these initiatives is to help bring the \nmetaverse to life,” said Zuckerberg.4 “I think over the next \nfive years or so, in this next chapter of our company, I think \nwe will effectively transition from people seeing us as pri-\nmarily being a social media company to being a metaverse \ncompany.”5\nSource: Image: Facebook\nThis case study was written by Michael Olenick, Executive Fellow at the INSEAD Blue Ocean Strategy Institute, under the supervision of W.

It is the Broadway, the \nChamps Élysées of the Metaverse. It is the brilliantly lit \nboulevard that can be seen, miniaturized and backward, \nreflected in the lenses of his goggles. It does not really \nexist. But right now, millions of people are walking up \nand down it.\n—Neal Stephenson, Snow Crash\nThe roots of the metaverse concept come from the influen-\ntial 1992 science fiction book Snow Crash. Neal Stephenson \nenvisioned a fully immersive virtual world where people work, \nplay, socialize, spend, and scheme. Stephenson coined the term \nmetaverse to describe his world, painting the real world outside \nthe virtual reality goggles as a drab suburban dystopia.\nIn Stephenson’s world, outside the goggles, income dis-\nparity has reached critical levels, with countless people \nsurviving as delivery drivers overseen by computers that \noptimize their work much like factory machinery might be \noptimized. Hiro, Stephenson’s hero, lives in a storage locker. \nBut by putting on his virtual reality goggles and headphones, \nHiro is transported into the metaverse, a fantastical world of \nfun, excitement, adventure, and vastly better housing. The \noutside world remains drab and depressing, but except for \nfood, it doesn’t much matter.\nZuckerberg’s Metaverse\nThe link between Facebook and Snow Crash is not coinci-\ndental. In 2014, former Facebook data scientist Dean Eckles \nsaid new Facebook product managers were required to read \nSnow Crash.6 Since then, Zuckerberg has been working hard \nto remove the fiction part of Stephenson’s sci-fi novel, appar-\nently overlooking the dystopic nature of Stephenson’s vision \n(Appendix A).\nAnnouncing what his metaverse might look like, Zucker-\nberg zaps himself into a digitized representation of a house \nthat starts from a wireframe then quickly fills in with details.7 \nLight pours in, much like it might in a Palo Alto home, but \nthe size of the space feels larger than anything the Palo Alto \nzoning board would permit. Art adorns the walls but so do \nspacesuits and suits of armor. Look closely and you notice \nthe view outside one window is a tropical island, but outside \nanother, a Tahoe winter. It’s a subtly magical place.\nThere’s a feeling of privacy, of being in a private space, \neven if both the feeling and space are entirely illusory. Watch-\ning Zuckerberg’s vision, it’s difficult to ignore that the space \nisn’t genuinely private – especially if the user wearing the \ngoggles lives in a shared physical space– but that the vir-\ntual world, run by Meta, also suffers the same privacy issues  \nFacebook famously struggles with.\nMark receives a call from a disembodied voice and lifts \nhis hand, much as he would if he were carrying a phone, \nwhich is both impossible and unnecessary in this virtual \nworld. A popup appears in thin air, above his wrist, inviting \nhim to “Space Room.” The popup looks like a messenger \nwindow, complete with a voice transcribed to speech bubbles. \nBefore beaming himself to the Space Room, he’s “just gotta \nfind something to wear” and so flips through a few outfits, \nchoosing one that inexplicably looks identical to the outfit \nhe’s already virtually wearing in his metaverse house.\nSpace Room has four people waiting for him, three \ndressed normally and one rendered as a robot. They’re play-\ning cards that float in the air, as one of the meeting partic-\nipants also does. The group quickly decides to call another \nperson, Naomi, and again Mark lifts his arm as if holding a \nphone. Although there is no need or place for a phone in this \nmetaverse, a typical smartphone interface appears.\nZuckerberg calls, and Naomi answers with video, standing \nwith a flesh-and-blood friend on a decidedly non-virtual city \nstreet. Although she’s with somebody else, walking through \nthe streets of New York City, Mark asks, “Shall we deal you \nin” to the game? Unphased by the odd request to ignore her \nfriend and zap to a virtual spaceship while walking with a \nfriend, she instead refers to an artist in Soho “hiding AR \n[augmented reality] pieces for people to find.” She zaps them \n“3D street art” that looks like somebody spilled a plate of spa-\nghetti at the international space station, with strands floating \nabove a table. “Stunning,” somebody remarks offscreen.\nWe return from the demo metaverse to reality. In 2010, \nZuckerberg famously declared “privacy is a social norm of \nthe past,” but he now stares at the camera and deadpans \n“privacy and safety need to be built into the metaverse from \nday one.”8 To emphasize the point, the verbiage also appears \non-screen, the only words spelled out as well as being spoken. \nMark barely blinks, and it’s hard not to think he looks more \nlike a man reading a forced confession or maybe a statement \nfrom the Meta legal team – than a true believer in privacy. \nEven then, it’s difficult to overlook the passive verbiage “need \nto be built,” as opposed to the more definite “will be built.”\nGetting back to his planned new world, Zuckerberg \nexplains that users will have virtual homes, workplaces, and \ngames in the metaverse. Physical products that display any-\nthing which can be digitized in the real world will be replaced \nby virtual metaverse products. For example, there is no need \nfor a real phone in the metaverse: it is replaced by a phone \napplication that presumably has both instant (and likely free \nor very low priced) upgrades. Televisions, computer screens, \nbooks – really, almost anything people can’t rest on or eat – \nwill be transformed from a physical thing into a digital app. \nMany products needn’t be more than a digital copy of their \nphysical form. For example, the Meta-owned Oculus Netflix \napp is already a 3D projection of a cozy living room with a \nlarge virtual television screen.\nYour Personal World\nZuckerberg’s choice of worlds was relatively tame. There’s no \nreason for that suit of armor to hang on the wall; users may \nas well wear it, helmet and all, or even add a virtual horse \nto complete the outfit. They may even choose to be a horse. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

If you’d prefer to live in the medieval era, \nthe metaverse can make it so, at least within your goggles. \nLanguage barriers will quickly break down as artificial intel-\nligence (AI) translation systems rapidly improve. Virtually \nanything is possible in the metaverse.\nMetaverse technology may improve upon the positive \nelements of social media, connecting people to their families \nand tribes no matter where they are in the world. Shrinking \nphysical distance can shrink geographic advantages, enabling \ncollaboration between workers from Bangalore, Bangkok, \nBavaria, and the Bay Area. Business meetings in a metaverse \nwill have less environmental impact than far-flung meetings \nin real life and can offer interactivity well beyond video chats \nto encourage creativity and cooperation. Talent could be \ntapped, and physical borders transcended, no matter where \nin the world a person physically resides.\nIn the metaverse, people with physical disabilities regain \nindependence and a form of mobility. Loneliness can be mit-\nigated, especially for the elderly as the goggles bring them to \na friendlier world in which they can project their bodies to \nagain be young and healthy. People can find cross-cultural \nexperiences no matter where they live or what their personal \nlevel of wealth. Visiting Paris will require nothing more than \na snap of one’s virtual fingers, enabling anybody to digitally \nsit on the edge of the Seine, transporting them there virtually, \ninstantly, and potentially for free.\nDull Zoom classes can theoretically become 3D repre-\nsentations of a regular classroom that better enables full-\nblown interaction. Every student can have access to the latest \nlaboratory equipment, all produced virtually, and be able to \nexperiment to their heart’s content without worries about  \nhurting themselves or their school. Real-world frogs will jump \nwith delight as dissections become virtual. Everything from \nhuman anatomy to the internals of jet engines can be taught \nto students, enabling them to potentially learn in more detail \nand at a better pace than by using scarce materials which may \nnot be accessible to all.\nAs apps replace physical things, the environmental foot-\nprint could theoretically be dramatically reduced. There’ll \nbe no more old phones or televisions, all replaced by digital \nrepresentations of the same with no more harmful environ-\nmental impact than streaming a movie. Even the need for \nclothing could potentially be greatly reduced, with digital \nfashions for one’s online avatar interchangeable and instantly \nupdated to the latest from Paris and Milan while the flesh-\nand-blood person wearing the goggles remains in sweatpants \nand a comfortable sweater. Aside from maybe oil compa-\nnies and commercial property owners, few will likely miss \nthe rush hour commute even though remote work comes at \nthe cost of lost real-world interactions and touch. Because of \nwork-from-home changes brought about by COVID, we’re \nalready seeing “dead” towns in remote places spring back to \nlife, a trend that may well accelerate. The rural/metro divide \nmay well shrink, bringing people potentially closer to where \nthe food they eat is grown but also more physically removed \nfrom their colleagues and friends.\nTrouble in Paradise\nThis raises a fundamental question: will people want to be \nplugged in or want their children plugged in for hours every \nday?\nThere are well-established physical and mental health \nissues associated with excessive screen use. Minimally, inces-\nsantly staring at screens is hard on the eyes. Staring into \ngoggles, which are even closer than screens, is likely to raise \nfurther questions about the effects of nearby electronics on \nhealth, including and especially on vision. There is also the \ncouch potato effect: sitting around for long periods con-\nnected to screens or phones has the potential to accelerate a \nsedentary lifestyle, which is not aligned with people’s physi-\ncal health and well-being. Indeed, as seen in the US, obesity \nis surging.10 The human body was made for movement, and \nlong-term health rests on it.\nAlthough some people may play in the metaverse while \non exercise equipment, it still risks inducing a fundamental \nand widening disconnect between people, nature, and the \nreal world of our planet. Walking amongst trees and plants \nto the wonder unfolded by a cool breeze or gentle rain or \nthe healing power of watching the ocean swell are known to \nbe beneficial to people’s emotional and physical well-being. \nThere is a reason the planners of major cities like New York \ncreated enormous nature parks in their centers, and despite \nyears of increasing congestion, nobody has ever seriously \nsuggested encroaching upon them. In New York City, for \nexample, even the suggestion of development inside Cen-\ntral Park would be akin to heresy. Nature is important to \nthe human psyche, and a digital representation of a natural \nsetting isn’t the same.\nFurther, given Meta’s historic privacy problems, there is \nthe fundamental issue about whether the public can trust the \nrenamed company, Meta, with the type of enormous power a \ndigital world enables. For example, when users hide an adver-\ntisement on Facebook the company asks why the user does \nnot like the ad. The first option is “Too personal” and the \nthird is “Knows too much.” Both choices suggest Meta real-\nizes their insight into a user’s psyche can be perceived as an \ninvasion of personal privacy.11\nThere is also the issue of Meta’s control and power. For \nexample, should Meta decide it doesn’t like somebody or a \ngroup of people, it could theoretically lock them out, making \nthem disappear temporarily or permanently from the site. \nThat already happens on Facebook, but people do not lose \ntheir ability to go to work, which could and would happen \nif the metaverse is built according to Zuckerberg’s vision. \nAdditionally, the same problem exists where traditional news  \norganizations are drawn to produce “click bait,” stories and \nheadlines lacking context or even containing outright incor-\nrect information, designed to draw in readers and viewers \nwho are then monetized for advertisers like a farmer milks \na cow. There’s no indication of how the metaverse might \nmitigate these issues, or even if Meta believes them to be a \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

If all sides of society do not trust Meta to address \nsuch issues in a fair way by applying the same criteria across \nall content, given Meta’s far- reaching influence, its metaverse \ncould trigger societal conflict with real-world consequences.\nFacebook itself is already a metaphorical public square, \nbut the metaverse seems to be a step towards an even larger \none, a blending of the physical and digital worlds. This \nenables the stuff of dreams, though dreams can easily turn \nto nightmares. Zuckerberg’s world may be a paradise for \nthe public, though it is also certain to attract the fraudsters, \npredators, and all manner of other parasites that social \nmedia currently struggles with. It’s unclear how Meta will \nmanage this issue.\nGiven the rushed rollout of the name change from  \nFacebook to Meta, it’s difficult to minimize these concerns \nas Meta struggles with mounting challenges and its business \npractices increasingly being called into question.12\nScreen/Gaming Addiction\nIn 2021, the Chinese government severely limited gaming \ntime for children under 18. “Protecting the physical and men-\ntal health of minors is related to the people’s vital interests, \nand relates to the cultivation of the younger generation in the \nera of national rejuvenation,” said a Chinese government offi-\ncial quoted by an official government news source.13 In addi-\ntion, controlling access to gaming also serves as an extension \nof the Great Firewall.\nWhile the metaverse will not be a game per se, Meta aims \nto create a never-ending virtual world that people will hardly \never want to leave, raising analogous concerns of addic-\ntive behavior. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists \n“gaming disorder” as a type of addictive behavior resulting \nin “marked distress or significant impairment in personal, \nfamily, social, educational, occupational, or other important \nareas of functioning.”14 Game addicts exhibit impaired con-\ntrol over gaming, give increasing priority to gaming over \nother life interests, and escalate their gaming despite negative \nconsequences, according to the WHO.15 “If you are living in \nan online world, there is a risk of a disconnect from your \nphysical self, which is particularly dangerous,” according to  \nDr. Louise Theodosiou, an adolescent psychiatrist. “If you \nhave something distorting the relationship between the emo-\ntional and analytical parts of the brain, it’s potentially damag-\ning and also very compulsive.”16\nWhile it’s unlikely that Meta purposefully wishes “nega-\ntive consequences” on their users, it is unclear if Zuckerberg \nbelieves transferring a large part of a person’s life into his \nmetaverse is negative. However, as former Google “design \nethicist” Steve Inskeep puts it, the industry is “less and less \nabout actually trying to benefit people and more and more \nabout how do we keep people hooked.”17\nCountless stories of gaming and internet addiction are easy \nto find. One teen on the site GameQuitters.com recounts stay-\ning up until 5:00 AM gaming when he was seven or eight years \nold, followed by years of impaired schooling and even outright \ntheft to support his gaming habit. “I was stagnant, not growing, \nand just living with this constant desire to be playing games,” \nwrote the author.18 Another recovering adolescent game addict \nwrites: “I started playing [video games] when I was around  \n9 years old. I played because I found it fun, but after a while I \nplayed mostly because I preferred it over socializing and con-\nfronting my problems.”19\nThroughout the world, there are in-patient internet and \ngaming addiction clinics, much like their substance abuse \ncounterparts. One website lists “luxury rehabs … focused on \ndetoxing from technology for teens and young adults.”20\nConvincing parents to invest in more computer hardware \nto enable ever more screen time may prove an uphill battle. In \naddition, while Western countries have not taken the Chinese \napproach to limit young people’s screen time (though they \nrestrict alcohol and tobacco sales to adults because of their \naddictive and destructive properties), if screen time evolves \nto be seen as similarly dangerous, especially among youth, it’s \nnot too farfetched to believe some level of regulation may be \nforthcoming in Western countries as well.\nA Real-Life Business Model for a \nVirtual World\nPut a sign or a building on the Street (of the metaverse) \nand the hundred million richest, hippest, best-connected \npeople on earth will see it every day of their lives.\n—Neal Stephenson, Snow Crash\nEven dating back to Stephenson’s original vision, metaverses \nhave massive profit potential. But specifics about their busi-\nness model, for Meta and other metaverses, remain blurry.\nConspicuously absent in Zuckerberg’s announcement \nwere answers about how the firm plans to financially profit \nfrom the metaverse. As noted above, he stated that they \nwill be investing an enormous amount of capital, at least  \n$10 billion in the first year and more in subsequent years, \nto build the technology. He also stated that they will lose \nmoney for a long time investing in their metaverse. But as a \ncompany with annualized revenues of $116 billion and profits  \nof $36.8 billion (based on projecting Q2 2021), Meta has \nextraordinarily deep pockets for future investment.\nZuckerberg needn’t worry about Wall Street getting antsy. \nAs of Q3 2021, his personal net worth is about $120 billion. \nHe purchased the Palo Alto houses around his own to pro-\ntect his privacy and owns an enormous Hawaiian estate. Due \nto the way Meta is structured, Zuckerberg controls 58% of \nthe voting rights, a figure virtually impossible to dilute with \npublicly traded shares.21 Meta Class A shares, the ones the \npublic trades, receive one vote, but the business is controlled \nby Class B shares which each receive ten votes and are not \npublicly traded. These Class B shares are overwhelmingly \nowned by Zuckerberg (see Appendix B). Zuckerberg has the \nright to unilaterally decide the business’s investment priori-\nties. Should he decide to spend all Meta’s profits plus more on \nthe metaverse for the foreseeable future, ordinary investors \nwho disagree have little recourse but to sell their stock.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Apple realized 2019 prof-\nits of $8.5 billion from gaming alone, a figure disclosed in a \nrecent lawsuit.22 Since Apple captures one-third of the money \nspent, we can extrapolate gamers spent about $25.5 billion on \niOS games alone in 2019. Industry estimates are that global \ngaming revenues will reach $198 billion by 2024. Still, it’s \ndifficult to imagine Meta will abandon its traditional core \nmarket of selling highly targeted advertising.\nOn November 9, 2021, the firm did announce, after the \nMeta pivot, that they’ll stop enabling ad targeting based on \nhealth, race, ethnicity, political affiliation, religion, sexual \norientation, and other similarly sensitive attributes. It’s too \nearly to know if the changes reflect a heartfelt pivot towards \nprivacy or are in response to, for example, an ongoing lawsuit \nby the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nwhich sued Facebook for enabling illegal advertising based \non race, religion, and national origin.23\nMeta Isn’t the Only Metaverse\nOther tech firms besides Meta have built or are building or \nexploring metaverse technologies but describe a vision and \nbusiness model with more tangible benefits.\n“With our metaverse stack, you can start with the digital \ntwin, building a rich digital model of anything physical or logi-\ncal, whether it’s assets, products, a complex environment span-\nning people, places, things, and their interactions. The digital \ntwin is bound to the physical world in real-time so you can \nmonitor the environment and collaborate within it using mixed \nreality. You can run simulations. You can apply AI to analyze and \npredict future states,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.24\nEpic games profits from their early metaverse by sell-\ning virtual goods such as outfits and dances. They’re also \npushing ahead into a full-fledged metaverse focused on \ntheir popular game, Fortnite. “What (metaverse-like tech-\nnology) exists right now, it’s based on algorithmic feeds \nthat are driven by ad revenue, not a model,” said Sima  \nSistani, whose company, House Party, was acquired by Epic, \nwhere she remains as head of community. “That instantly \ntakes you into polarized worlds. If you are putting joy at the \ncenter of what you’re doing, and not ads, and the goal is col-\nlaboration, the goal is fun, the goal is participating, making \nnew friends, those are just super different incentives and \nmotivations.”25\nInside Fortnite, Epic hosted a series of several metaverse-like \nconcerns. Ariana Grande performed in August 2021.26 Her con-\ncert is difficult to describe but features a virtual Ariana Grande \nbreaking through and flying through lights, then surfing over \nmulticolored water into an arena that doesn’t exist in the real \nworld. As her music plays, she floats hanging from an umbrella \nin a multicolored universe with clouds shaped like hearts, leap-\ning and twirling in ways that would be impossible in real life. \nLater, Grande wanders through space looking infinitely more \nstylish and lots more interesting than Zuckerberg, dancing with \notherworldly planets below and stars above.\nAbout a million people watched the concert at any one \ntime. While tickets were free, it’s not hard to imagine better \nvirtual “seats” being sold or maybe non-fungible tokens \n(NFTs), much like collectible merchandise from a traditional \nconcert. It’s more difficult to imagine how the worlds enabled \nby these technologies could fail to be profitable rather than \nthe myriad ways creative strategists and marketers could use \nthe technology to profit.\nRoblox is also building metaverse technology with a simple \nbut powerful programming environment where users, two-\nthirds of whom are 15 years old or younger, build and play in \n3D virtual worlds. Besides the newer offerings, the best-known \noriginal metaverse, Second Life, still exists, though with far \nfewer users than in its heyday in the early aughts.27\nThe Public Speaks\nFacebook did not enable comments about the announce-\nment of the name change to Meta and its metaverse on their \nown pages despite comments being arguably the single most \nimportant component of Facebook after posts.28 However, a \nglance at other social media helps explain their reluctance: \nreaction to Meta’s push to build a metaverse can best be \ndescribed as unenthusiastic.\nA Twitter user, channeling what he believed Zuckerberg \nwas saying, wrote: “Now that I’ve turned actual reality [into] a \ndystopian nightmare, I’m back to sell you a new virtual reality \nwhere everything is wonderful. Trust me!” Others were less \nkind. Another comment read: “Tired of meeting people in \nreal life? Try our ad-supported metaverse where we connect \npedophiles to children and hate-filled people to toxic streams \nof disinformation.”29\nStudents, one of the core target audiences, were skep-\ntical. When asked why Meta was focused on a metaverse, \nDamien Theriault, a second-year New Brunswick student, \nsaid: “Money. It’s always about the money.”30 Others claim that \nMeta is co-opting various lesser- known metaverses. “They are \nessentially trying to build what many of us have been building \nfor years, but rebranding it as their own,” said Ryan Kappel.31\nSeveral people were gentler but suggested Meta has work \nto do on their core products before launching any new ones. \n“I think we’d all prefer you all fixing and perfecting what \nyou’ve already built before focusing on what’s next. Lot of \nwork needs to be done here. Far too much to divide your \nattention with some future project,” said Twitter user Awale \nAhmed Ali.32 “Facebook’s new name is Meta,” said CNN’s \nDonnie O’Sullivan after the announced name change. “It still \nhas all the same problems it had this morning.”33\nA smaller number of users were supportive. “People nor-\nmally disrespect and FUD (spread Fear, Uncertainty, and \nDoubt) about other projects in which they are not invested \nbecause they think the money going to that one project isn’t \ngoing to their project,” wrote Twitter user SafeMoon. “People, \nthere’s so much money out there you can’t even comprehend. \nThere’s lots of room for everyone.”34\nExpert opinion was more serious, and more ominous, \nciting research that parents should be especially wary of \nthe new virtual reality metaverse. “Adults appear to control \nand regulate their [VR] presence experience by critically \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

VR engulfs \nus … We slide occluding goggles over our eyes and cover \nour ears with headphones, overriding our two primary sense \nsystems with simulated digital signals …VR is the apotheosis \nof every media fear and fantasy we’ve ever had.”36\nAnother expert notes that virtual reality technology makes \nmonitoring children’s behaviors especially challenging. “It’s \nalready hard to monitor what your kids are doing, but at least \nyou can look over their shoulder at a screen,” said Michigan State \nUniversity media professor Rabindra Ratan. “When they’re in \nVR, they’re blocked off, you can’t really see what they’re doing. \nParents need to understand kids’ games, what they’re playing, \nwhy they’re playing them, who they’re playing them with. You \nhave to be an informed consumer right along with them.”37\nMetaverse Technology\nIn his announcement of Meta, Zuckerberg focused quite \na bit on metaverse technology and did not shy away from \ntech-related terminology. “Today we’re introducing the \npresence platform, which is a broad range of perception and \nAI capabilities that empower developers to build mixed- \nreality experiences,” Zuckerberg said. His use of the term \n“platform” could be interpreted to mean that the firm aims \nto create a metaverse of metaverses, a universe controlling \ntraffic to metaverses much as Google controls search results.\nFollowing on, he went into detail about the difficulty of \nprogramming virtual hands that mimic real-life hand move-\nments and brought in the former head of Facebook Reality \nLab and now Facebook Chief Technology Officer Andrew \n“Boz” Bosworth in his announcement video.38\n“Realistic presence is the key to feeling connected in the \nmetaverse,” Bosworth says in the video. “Things like environ-\nmental understanding, content placement and persistence, \nvoice interaction, standardized hand interactions. In fact, let’s \nstart with hands. The human hand is an engineering marvel. \nBringing hands into VR was no easy feat … Today, we’re \nintroducing the Interaction SDK, a library of components \nthat will make it easy to add hand interactions to your apps.”\n“That’s pretty exciting!” answers Zuckerberg, using a defi-\nnition of “exciting” that clearly targets software developers.\nOne of Zuckerberg’s lead advisors on metaverses is Mat-\nthew Ball, a venture capitalist at EpyllionCo and former head \nof strategy at Amazon Studios. “I thought Matthew Ball’s \nessays were great, and anyone who’s trying to learn about [the \nMetaverse] … he wrote a nine-part piece on a bunch of the \ndifferent aspects of what the metaverse could be, and I highly \nrecommend all of them,” Zuckerberg wrote.39\nBall argues a fully functional metaverse must have certain \nattributes.40 It will:\n1. Be persistent, an experience that never ends;\n2. Be synchronous and live, a real-time community just like \nreal life;\n3. Scale indefinitely – a metaverse will support unlimited \nusers, though regardless of the total number, individ-\nual users will each have their own sense of self, as in \nreal life;\n4.

As you know, we are all \nin this together, so you may share your thoughts with me.”\n[Hiro replies] “I’d prefer a little more discretion in this \ncase …” “Too late for that, Hiro,” says another voice.\nAccording to Ball, “Metaverses are a blue ocean opportunity.41 \nLook at the classic categories that have been merged with \nthe internet. They don’t displace. Telecom, banking. In \nmobile, we see Venmo, Square, Stripe that are predomi-\nnantly around mobile. Skype still exists but WhatsApp is \nmuch larger. In the metaverse, we see cryptocurrencies \nand Discord and Fortnite beginning to supplant traditional \nplatforms. All those are larger than they’ve been because \nthe economy grew so much. Those are new companies that \nemerged to found blue oceans.\n“Developers are the one limitation where you do see more \ndirect competition,” Ball says, comparing the need for tech \ncompanies to attract developers to the need for movie studios \nto attract talent. “In Hollywood, we bid for creatives but don’t \nnecessarily compete for viewers … Better, faster, cheaper for \ndevelopers will lead to better profits for developers. Devs \nalways go to where the profitability is. Nobody invests in \nlearning a language nobody speaks.”\nQuestions\n1. Is Meta’s metaverse on track to offer a leap in value to users, \nor is it more akin to technology innovation that advances \ntechnology without necessarily delivering a compelling leap \nin value for users? Explain your thinking.\n2. Meta’s vision has social, economic, and environmental \nimplications. Enumerate what you see as the strengths and \nweaknesses of its metaverse across these dimensions and \nhow to ameliorate some of the weaknesses or concerns to \nbetter link Meta’s technology to a leap in value.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

If Meta realizes its intention of creating one enormous \nmetaverse, it will yield even greater political, social, and eco-\nnomic power for the business. Are there safety issues with \none business holding this much control? How could this best \nbe mitigated – a breakup of the business? government regu-\nlation? something else?\n4.

And yet, historically, the majority \nof entertainment content in the world has been produced in \nHollywood in the English language. It’s in that disconnect that \nwe see a tremendous opportunity.1\n—Greg Peters, Netflix Chief Product Officer (2019)\nStreaming the Future\nOn the morning of November 10, 2020, Anna Mallett sat at \nher desk at Independent Television News (ITN) in London \nand gazed out the window.2 She knew the day would be full \nof commotion; in the early morning hours, the announce-\nment of her imminent departure as ITN’s CEO had been \nmade public in a press release from Netflix. Mallett was \nassuming the expansive role of Netflix’s vice president (VP) \nof Physical Production, in which she would oversee all pro-\nduction in the United Kingdom and all local-language pro-\nduction across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); \nMexico, Central America, and South America (LATAM); and \nEast Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania (APAC). \nWhile she would miss her CEO role as well as the team she \nhad built at ITN over the past year and a half since joining \nin April 2019, Mallett was ecstatic about the opportunity to \njoin Netflix and lead the company’s local production efforts \nthroughout most of the globe.\nNevertheless it was a huge responsibility, and as a prac-\ntical matter, it would dramatically change Mallett’s rhythms \nof work, operations, and leadership. She recognized that the \nrole would require all the expertise she had gained over the \npreceding decades. While ITN was one of the largest inde-\npendent television production companies in the United \nKingdom—focused largely on the news programming of \nBritain’s ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5—Mallett knew she \nwould also need to draw on her previous experience at the \nBritish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), where she had led \nBBC Studioworks and directed the BBC’s overall commer-\ncial strategy,3 overseeing high-profile shows like Strictly Come \nDancing and the venerated serial science fiction drama Doctor \nWho.4 She would likely find valuable the seven years she had \nspent at the Boston Consulting Group in London, where she \nhad focused on media and retail, and even her MBA from \nHarvard Business School and her DPhil from Oxford. In \nmany ways, Mallett saw all her training and experience as \nhaving prepared her for this moment. And it was a moment \nshe was eager to seize. As she stated, “I am thrilled to be \njoining Netflix at this exciting time as the company con-\ntinues to accelerate its production of great stories from all \nover the world. Netflix is a creative powerhouse, and I am \nlooking forward to working with my exceptional new col-\nleagues across the UK, EMEA, LATAM and APAC to bring \nthe very best films and series to audiences everywhere.”5 She \nwould be reporting to Ty Warren, Netflix’s VP of Worldwide \nProduction, who had suggested that Mallett’s hire came at a \ncrucial time for Netflix; she would bring “a wealth of global \nproduction experience and strategic expertise to our produc-\ntion team as we continue to expand our investment in origi-\nnal programming throughout the world.”6\nAfter 2020 Q2 earnings posted another quarter of mas-\nsive growth in paid subscribers, Q3 earnings showed a sub-\nstantial slowdown in new subscriptions, totaling 28.2 million \nfor the first three quarters of 2020. The 26 million added \nsubscribers through the first half of 2020 represented a more \nthan 100% increase over 2019, but the drop in new additions \nto 2.2 million in Q3 fell short of expectations and caused con-\ncern.7 Nevertheless, Netflix’s impressive growth outside of the \nUnited States and Canada in recent years—more than half \nof paid subscribers now lived in the European Union, Latin \nAmerica, or Asia—put the company in a good position to \ncontinue to capitalize on the massive uptick in digital con-\nsumption resulting from COVID-19. Despite the pandemic \npausing production on various studio projects, both in the \nUnited States and abroad, Netflix had been able to keep its \nglobal member base satisfied with a steady stream of new \ncontent acquisitions and original releases.\nYet, as the company acknowledged,8 the favorable bump \nin performance during the first half of 2020 was best treated as \nan aberration, and Netflix should not allow short-term gains \nto distract from the reality that the pandemic-stricken future \nwas rife with uncertainty; the downtick in new subscribers \nin Q3 illustrated some of that unpredictability. Competition \nwas more intense than ever before, with nearly every major \nentertainment company now pushing its own streaming ser-\nvice and many boasting back catalogs of content going back \nseveral decades. How could Netflix continue its impressive \ngrowth and stay true to its mission of providing entertaining \nand valuable content to more and more customers all around \nthe world? What would be the role of local content pro-\nduction across the globe in Netflix’s continued growth and \nThis public-sourced case was prepared by Jared D. Harris, Samuel L.

These questions fell squarely on Mallett’s shoulders \nas she assumed her new role at the company.\nFrom Red Envelopes to Oscars\nFounded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in \nScotts Valley, California, Netflix started as an online DVD \nsubscription service, mailing red envelopes containing mov-\nies and ultimately helping to usher in the demise of brick-\nand-mortar video rental stores, such as Blockbuster and \nHollywood Video. In 2007, sensing the evolution in media \nconsumption, Netflix transitioned to a subscription vid-\neo-on-demand (SVOD) model, becoming a pioneer in this \nservice—though not before the now-famous Qwikster mis-\nstep, when Netflix tried to spin off its DVD rental business \nas a separate entity.9 By 2020, Netflix was the world’s leading \nsubscription-based streaming-entertainment service pro-\nvider, with a presence in over 190 countries, and it was rec-\nognized as a major production company, with eight Academy \nAwards for motion pictures and more than 30 Emmy Awards \nfor television.10\nNetflix’s core business was its SVOD service model, in \nwhich the company received monthly fees from subscribers, \nwho in turn had unlimited access to a unique, region-specific \nlibrary of both licensed and Netflix-original content, such as \ntelevision shows and feature films, that could be streamed on \ndemand.11 Most users could access Netflix through a number \nof different platforms, including personal computers, smart-\nphones, tablets, smart televisions, and video game consoles. \nThis model had been wildly successful for Netflix and had \nsince been imitated by numerous international and domes-\ntic competitors around the world. In Q2 2020, Netflix gener-\nated USD6.1 billion in revenue, with nearly 193 million paid \nmemberships across the globe.12 Even prior to the significant \nincrease in growth due to COVID-19, Netflix’s revenues had \ngrown at an average rate of 33% annually since its IPO in 2002 \n(Exhibit 1), and net income grew 98% on average, annually, \nyielding net earnings of USD1.87 billion in 2019.13 As of the end \nof October 2020, Netflix’s market capitalization was estimated \nat nearly USD222.8 billion, with a price per share of USD504 \n(Exhibit 2).\nNetflix’s performance was particularly impressive given \nthe intense competition it faced from other SVOD services \nsuch as Hulu and Amazon Prime, more traditional cable tele-\nvision providers, transactional video-on-demand services like \nApple TV, free or ad-based services like YouTube, and count-\nless other forms of digital entertainment that could occupy a \npotential subscriber’s leisure time. While being one of the first \nmovers in the industry may have helped initially, it did not \nexplain how Netflix was able to defend against new entrant \nafter new entrant, in particular competing services from com-\npanies that owned the content Netflix had previously licensed.\nInstead, Netflix’s survival and success could be attributed \nto its strategic investments in technology, internationaliza-\ntion, and content, all of which complemented one another. \nPut simply, while Netflix’s streaming platform was the tech-\nnology that most members associated with the company, it \nwas in many ways secondary to the invaluable data on user \npreferences that the company captured. At a baseline, this data \ncould be used to simply update each user’s recommendations, \nbut taken further it could be used to generate broader insights \ninto the behavior of certain demographic groups. Once it \nwas armed with this knowledge, it was only a matter of time \nbefore Netflix began to acquire and produce original content, \nstarting with the critically acclaimed House of  Cards televi-\nsion series, which it won in a competitive bid against HBO. \nExhibit 1  Netflix’s Revenues from 2002 to 2019 (in millions of US dollars)\nSource: Unless otherwise noted, all exhibits created by authors using publicly available data.\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n0\n5,000\n10,000\n15,000\n20,000\n25,000\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Consequently, Netflix’s growth could be seen as \nmore than simply a push to increase revenue: it was also a \nway to enhance its own unique capabilities and resources. As \nNetflix expanded to more members, in more countries, with \na library of increasingly diverse content, the data it was able to \ncollect and utilize became even more powerful, enabling it to \nmake increasingly informed and efficient decisions about the \ntypes of content that it licensed and produced.14\nNetflix’s Global Expansion\nNetflix’s process of global expansion had become a key to \nits success, but its international expansion hadn’t happened \nall at once. Rather, Netflix’s global expansion strategy had \nunfolded in several phases. First, the company carefully \nselected its initial adjacent markets in terms of geography and \nmarket similarity.\nIn 2010, three years after launching its streaming ser-\nvice, Netflix expanded outside the United States for the \nfirst time, bringing its streaming service to the Canadian \nmarket.15 Canada was the United States’ largest geographic \nneighbor and shared many demographic and cultural sim-\nilarities with the United States, allowing Netflix to “develop \nits internationalization capabilities” in a location where the \n“challenges of foreignness were less acute.”16\nThis allowed Netflix to develop the knowhow to expand \ninto a more diverse set of markets shortly afterward. Just \none year later, Netflix launched its service across 43 coun-\ntries in Latin America. Between 2012 and 2015, the company \ncontinued its expansion, reaching the United Kingdom, \nIreland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland in 2012; \nthe Netherlands in 2013; Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, \nLuxembourg, and Switzerland in 2014; and Spain, Italy, \nPortugal, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan by the end of \n2015. This faster and “more-extensive international expan-\nsion” continually drew upon lessons learned and was influ-\nenced by each new market’s “degree of attractiveness” that \nincorporated “shared similarities, the presence of affluent \nconsumers, and the availability of broadband internet.”17\nThen, just a month later in January 2016, Netflix went \nlive in another 130 countries throughout Africa, the Middle \nEast, and Asia (Exhibit 3).18 To achieve this “much acceler-\nated pace” of international expansion, the company employed \neverything it had learned from its global experiences so far, \nincluding an understanding of how to determine the “con-\ntent people prefer, the marketing they respond to, and how \nthe company needed to organize itself.”19 The expansion into \nmarkets that were further removed, both culturally and geo-\ngraphically, required Netflix to invest in more localized con-\ntent, as well as make technological investments that involved \nExhibit 3 Netflix’s Global Expansion\nSource: Adapted from Galileo Russell, “When Will Netflix Start Producing Cash Flow?,” Seeking Alpha, July 26, 2017, https://seekingalpha.com/article/4090754-when-will-netflix-start \n-producing-cash-flow (accessed Feb. 4, 2022).\nRest of world\n(excluding People’s\nRepublic of China,\nCrimea, North Korea,\nand Syria)\nSpain\nPortugal\nItaly\nJapan\nAustralia\nNew Zealand\nNetherlands\nFinland\nDenmark\nSweden\nNorway\nGermany\nAustria\nSwitzerland\nFrance\nBelgium\nLuxembourg\nCanada\nLatin America\nUnited Kingdom\nIreland\nSeptember\n2010\nSeptember\n2011\nJanuary\n2012\nOctober\n2012\nSeptember\n2013\nSeptember\n2014\nMarch\n2015\nSeptember\n2015\nJanuary\n2016\nOctober\n2015\nExhibit 2 Netflix Stock Price (in US dollars)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\nOct 2002\nApr 2003\nOct 2003\nApr 2004\nOct 2004\nApr 2005\nOct 2005\nApr 2006\nOct 2006\nApr 2007\nOct 2007\nApr 2008\nOct 2008\nApr 2009\nOct 2009\nApr 2010\nOct 2010\nApr 2011\nOct 2011\nApr 2012\nOct 2012\nApr 2013\nOct 2013\nApr 2014\nOct 2014\nApr 2015\nOct 2015\nApr 2016\nOct 2016\nApr 2017\nOct 2017\nApr 2018\nOct 2018\nApr 2019\nOct 2019\nApr 2020\nOct 2020\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

These investments facilitated the “mastery \nof local contexts, including the ability to acquire local knowl-\nedge and to demonstrate sensitivity and responsiveness.”20\nGiven its operations in so many international locations, \nNetflix was able to try different approaches in different mar-\nkets, relying on customer usage data to help determine which \nofferings worked best in various regions; as the number of \nNetflix’s international subscribers grew, the “performance of \nits predictive algorithms” continued to improve.21 By Q1 2017, \nthe company had realized its first profits from the interna-\ntional streaming segment. This encouraging milestone fueled \nfurther investment in global growth.22 By Q2 2017, interna-\ntional subscribers had exceeded its domestic ones for the \nfirst time in its history.23 By 2018, international streaming \nhad produced more revenue for the company than domestic \nstreaming,24 and the United States no longer boasted the most \nstreaming titles, having been surpassed by Japan.25 Amid \nincreasing competition and slowing growth in the domestic \nmarket, the considerable opportunities in the international \narena made it clear that Netflix’s future success would be \ndriven by its global aspirations (Exhibit 4). As it continued to \nboth literally and figuratively translate the value of its service \nfor global audiences, the company had to continue to make \ncritical decisions in several key areas, such as content, pric-\ning, and a number of other operational issues associated with \nglobal expansion.\nContent\nNetflix’s core business model relied on licensing content from \nintellectual property (IP) owners in order to make it available \non the streaming platform. However, Netflix needed to nego-\ntiate licenses for each country where the content would be \navailable. Moreover, as an American company that primarily \ncatered to American audiences, Netflix predominantly dealt \nin content that would appeal to the domestic market. While \nthis might not be a major issue for expansion to a country like \nCanada, it was not a foregone conclusion that the same con-\ntent would be as desirable for customers in France, India, or \nNigeria—countries that not only differed culturally but also \nhad their own robust film and television industries.\nOne key strategy that Netflix employed to address some \nof these challenges was to become the IP holder for origi-\nnal content. This step would at least eliminate the need to \nmanage thousands of licenses across a few hundred different \nmarkets. Moreover, despite the considerable investments that \nwere required to acquire and develop high-quality content, at \nfirst predominantly in the United States, the ability to easily \nroll it out to millions of subscribers across the globe made the \ncost accounting a bit more favorable.\nYet this strategy could not address the additional challenge \nof accommodating differences in cultures and customer pref-\nerences. To overcome this hurdle, Netflix secured licenses to \nlocal content in various countries and found that, in many \nmarkets, subscribers preferred these programs over US con-\ntent that was subtitled or dubbed. Perhaps more importantly, \nNetflix also learned that global audiences simply had a taste for \nhigh-quality content, no matter the language or cultural dif-\nferences. For example, the Spanish crime drama series Money \nHeist made Netflix’s top-10 most-viewed lists in more than \n70 countries.26 Similarly, Netflix brought television shows and \nfilms from several Asian markets to Western audiences, tout-\ning this content as “made in Asia[,] watched by the world.”27\nPricing\nThe other problem that Netflix had to solve was how \nmuch it should charge customers for its streaming service. \nSince content was licensed separately for each market, \nand because different audiences could perceive the same \ncontent differently, the value of Netflix’s service could \nvary from country to country. Moreover, subscribers’ \nExhibit 4 Domestic and International Subscribers by Quarter (in millions)\n200\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nQ3 2011\nQ4 2011\nQ1 2012\nQ2 2012\nQ3 2012\nQ4 2012\nQ1 2013\nQ2 2013\nQ3 2013\nQ4 2013\nQ1 2014\nQ2 2014\nQ3 2014\nQ4 2014\nQ1 2015\nQ2 2015\nQ3 2015\nQ4 2015\nQ1 2016\nQ2 2016\nQ3 2016\nQ4 2016\nQ1 2017\nQ2 2017\nQ3 2017\nQ4 2017\nQ1 2018\nQ2 2018\nQ3 2018\nQ4 2018\nQ1 2019\nQ2 2019\nQ3 2019\nQ4 2019\nQ1 2020\nUS Subscribers (millions)\nInternational Subscribers (millions)\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Whereas Netflix \ngradually increased prices in established markets like the \nUnited States (Exhibit 5), price sensitivity was a significant \nconcern for newer markets.\nConsider the example of Netflix’s foray into the Indian \nmarket beginning in 2016. 28 With a population of more than \none billion, India was clearly one of the most attractive mar-\nkets to enter, even more so because of the massive popularity \nof films there. By 2018, Netflix had ramped up investments in \nlocal content and marketing. “It’s been the fastest investment \nwe have ever made in any country since we launched. This \nreally reflects the richness of content creators we can draw \non—the best of Indian storytellers to create high-quality \noriginal series and movies,” said Michael Spiegelman, VP of \nGlobal Product Innovation.29\nHowever, despite this enthusiasm, Netflix faced a \nmajor hurdle: its service was more expensive and had less \nlocal-language content than its competitors. In other words, \nthe Netflix service simply was not a good value for many \nIndian customers. In early 2019, a Netflix subscription started \nat INR500 (about USD6.61) per month; Hotstar, the market \nleader, charged its customers INR365 (USD4.83) per year and \nheld 70% market share.30\nIn response, Netflix began implementing new pricing \nschemes.31 By the middle of 2019, Netflix rolled out an \ninnovative “mobile-only” plan to offer its service for a \nfraction of the cost (INR199 per a month). By the end of \n2019, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings announced the compa-\nny’s plans to invest INR3,000 crore32 (over USD400 mil-\nlion) on original and licensed content within the Indian \nmarket,33 an increase of 350% over its previous content \nbudget for India.34 By tailoring its service and pricing to \nbetter align with the demands and preferences of Indian \ncustomers, Netflix was able to achieve an eightfold increase \nin revenue (INR58 crore to INR470 crore) and a 25-fold \nincrease in profits (from INR20 lakh35 to INR5.15 crore), \nboth relative to the prior year, by the end of 2019.36 Building \noff these successes on the subcontinent, Netflix launched \nmobile-only plans in Indonesia and Malaysia, with similar \nresults, fueling Netflix’s rapid growth in the APAC region.37 \nBetween Q4 2019 and Q1 2020, the percentage of subscrib-\ners in the APAC region grew from 9.7% to 10.8% thanks to \nthe addition of approximately 3.6 million new subscribers \n(Exhibits 6 and 7).\nSuccesses in Asia, and other parts of the world, were \nproving more important than ever before for Netflix to sus-\ntain growth. While Netflix was never without competition \nin the streaming business, rivalry was about to become even \nmore intense for the SVOD leader.\nOther challenges\nBeyond the fundamental functions of content development \nand product pricing, Netflix also employed a localized \nExhibit 5 Netflix US Subscription Price Increases, by Tier\nSource: Created by authors based on data from Statista.\nMay\n2014\nMay\n2014\nOctober\n2017\nOctober\n2015\nOctober\n2017\nOctober\n2019\nApril\n2013\nJanuary\n2019\nJanuary\n2019\nNovember\n2010\n$7.99\n$8.99\n$7.99\n$8.99\n$9.99\n$10.99\n$12.99\n$11.99\n$13.99\n$15.99\nPremium\n(four screens,\nultra-high definition/4K)\nBasic\n(one screen,\nno high definition)\nStandard\n(two screens,\nhigh definition)\n+17%\n+13%\n+11%\n+10%\n+18%\n+17%\n+14%\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Netflix also faced \na “diverse set of national regulatory restrictions” that dic-\ntated programming criteria and limited the availability of \ncertain content in local markets.38 Furthermore, interna-\ntional subscribers often preferred local-language program-\nming, requiring the company to add subtitles and dubbing \nto streamed content, and local languages to its user interface. \nAnd the complexity posed by language differences didn’t \nstop there; support for “a range of device, operation, and \npayment partnerships” also needed to be developed,39 and \nsimple translation didn’t address all challenges with custom-\ners, either.\nFor instance, language changes also posed design chal-\nlenges; as text was translated from English to other lan-\nguages, it tended to “expand both horizontally and verti-\ncally,” potentially degrading user experiences on foreign \nlanguage versions of Netflix’s user interface, as text “gets \ncut off, calls to action are only partially visible,” or the “lay-\nout just looks wrong.”40 These challenges—simply posed by \nlanguage translational issues—prompted Netflix to employ \na technology called “pseudo localization,” which was a way \nfor designers to anticipate how the translated text would \nExhibit 6 Netflix Total Subscribers by Region\nQ1-2018\nQ2-2018\nQ3-2018\nQ4-2018\nQ1-2019\nQ2-2019\nQ3-2019\nQ4-2019\nQ1-2020\n21.26\n29.34\n7.39\n31.32\n22.80\n8.37\n33.84\n24.12\n9.46\n37.82\n26.08\n10.61\n42.54\n27.55\n12.14\n44.23\n27.89\n12.94\n47.36\n29.38\n14.49\n51.78\n31.42\n16.23\n58.73\n60.91\n61.87\n63.01\n64.76\n66.63\n66.50\n67.11\n67.66\n69.97\n34.32\n19.84\nUCAN\nNote: UCAN = United States and Canada; EMEA = Europe, the Middle East, and Africa;\nLATAM = Latin American; and APAC = the Asia-Pacific Region.\nEMEA\nLATAM\nAPAC\nExhibit 7 Revenue and Subscriber Share by Region, per Quarter\n51\n50\n48\n47\n45\n44\n42\n40\n38\n25\n25\n26\n27\n29\n29\n30\n31\n32\n18\n18\n18\n19\n19\n18\n19\n19\n19\n6\n7\n7\n8\n8\n9\n9.1\n9.7\n10.8\nPercentage of Total Subscribers\n55\n54\n54\n53\n51\n52\n49\n47\n25\n26\n26\n27\n28\n27\n29\n30\n15\n15\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n6\n6\n6\n7\n7\n51\n28\n14\n7\n7\n8\n8\nQ1 -\n2018\nQ2 -\n2018\nQ3 -\n2018\nQ4 -\n2018\nQ1 -\n2019\nQ2 -\n2019\nQ3 -\n2019\nQ4 -\n2019\nQ1 -\n2020\nQ1 -\n2018\nQ2 -\n2018\nQ3 -\n2018\nQ4 -\n2018\nQ1 -\n2019\nQ2 -\n2019\nQ3 -\n2019\nQ4 -\n2019\nQ1 -\n2020\nPercentage of Quarter Revenues\nNote: UCAN = United States and Canada; EMEA = Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; LATAM = Latin American; and APAC = the Asia-Pacific Region.\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0\nUCAN\nEMEA\nLATAM\nAPAC\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

For instance, \nwithin six months of entering Poland and Turkey in 2016, \nNetflix had added local languages to its websites, made \nsubtitles and dubbing available on its streaming content, \nand continued to engage with early adopters and iterate \nquickly.42 Expanded language offerings also facilitated even \ngreater personalization algorithms, varying by region, for its \nglobal library of content.\nLocal regulations and language translational challenges \nwere far from the only hurdles associated with localized mar-\nket penetration, however. Netflix needed its localized pro-\ngramming content to “feel true and authentic to the country \nit originates from,” because, as former Netflix executive Erik \nBarmack explained, “a show in India has to feel loved in that \nmarket first for it to have any strategic value.”43 Achieving this \noutcome required a deep knowledge of local cultures, across \na number of political, institutional, technical, customer, and \ncompetitor domains. International expansion and success \nremained a complex, multi-stakeholder and multi-disci-\nplinary challenge for organizations seeking wide global dis-\ntribution and presence.\nThe Streaming War Intensifies\nIn the United States, Netflix’s home market, SVOD was an \nincreasingly crowded and fragmented space in 2019, with \nleaders Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu pitted against \none another and an ever-growing number of new entrants. \nServices like YouTube, Direct TV NOW, HBO NOW, \nSling TV, and CrunchyRoll44 never posed major threats, \nbut 2019–20 ushered in serious competitive pressure from \nmajor IP holders, such as Disney+ (Disney, Fox), HBO \nMax (Time Warner), and Peacock (NBCUniversal), and \nnew competitors investing heavily into premium origi-\nnal content, such as Apple TV+. Not only did this affect \nNetflix’s content—for example, hugely popular movies and \nshows for Netflix like the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, \nFriends, and The Office were the IP of Disney, Time Warner, \nand NBCUniversal, respectively—but it also threatened \nsubscriber numbers and Netflix’s ability to acquire new \ncontent in the future.\nAnother notable characteristic of the new wave of com-\npetitors was that services like Disney+ and Apple TV+ were \nglobal ventures from launch, and they had distinct advantages \nthat enabled them to quickly build a subscriber base. Apple \ncould rely on its massive network of devices, from smart-\nphones to laptops. Additionally, it offered a free year of Apple \nTV+ to customers buying a new device in 2019, which enabled \nit to quickly reach an estimated 33.6 million US subscribers.45 \nDisney, by contrast, relied on its vast international experience, \nworld-class brand, and some of the most successful IP in cin-\nema history, from the original library of Disney classics, to \nPixar, Star Wars, and Marvel. Consequently, it was not a huge \nsurprise that Disney+ boasted more than 60 million subscrib-\ners by August 2020, less than one year after its launch.\nThe relative ease with which major studios could launch \ncompeting services meant that Netflix faced heightened \ncompetitive pressure and uncertainty moving forward. For \nexample, when the impending launch of Time Warner’s \nservice threatened the availability of Friends, Netflix paid \nUSD100 million to retain its license for one more year until \nthe acclaimed television show moved over to HBO Max in \n2020.46 NBCUniversal agreed to a USD500 million five-year \ndeal, beginning in 2021, for The Office, effectively outbidding \nNetflix for one of its most popular TV shows. The escalation \nof costs was unlikely to apply to licensed content alone; with \nmore competitors with deep pockets, the bidding for new \ncreative projects was also likely to intensify as an increasing \nnumber of notable writers, directors, producers, and actors \naligned themselves with streaming platforms to secure \nmore creative freedom and, just as important, massive pay-\nchecks.47 With subscribers able to jump to competitors with \nonly a few clicks, the only way to increase the opportunity \nand switching costs was to continue to provide highly desir-\nable content. Consequently, despite Netflix’s enviable mar-\nket position, the competitive balance could potentially shift \nvery quickly.\nPandemic Impacts Competition\nOf course, it was not simply escalating competition that \nNetflix faced in 2020. There was also the matter of the global \nCOVID-19 pandemic, which first affected Asian countries \nbut hit European markets and the United States especially \nhard. On one hand, a global event that forced hundreds of \nmillions of people to shelter in place and work from home \ncould be seen as good for the streaming business. Indeed, \nin the second quarter of 2020, Netflix’s revenue was up 25% \ncompared to Q2 2019, and it added 10.1 million new subscrib-\ners that quarter compared to 2.7 million in Q2 2019.48 On the \nother hand, the pandemic did not do Netflix any favors con-\nsidering the importance of content—production on nearly \nall projects screeched to a halt for several months and it was \nunclear when work would restart in some parts of the world.\nOn a broader level, the pandemic also caused a sea change \nfor the television and film industries. Movie theaters were \nshut down in many countries; major studios delayed releases; \nand companies began experimenting with launching multi-\nmillion-dollar films on streaming services. The live-action \nversion of Disney’s Mulan, which was delayed from its \noriginal March 2020 release, went straight to streaming on \nDisney+ under a “premium fee” model in which most sub-\nscribers could purchase access to the film for approximately \nUSD30—a higher price point than was typical for digital film \npurchases, but perhaps lower than the cost of a three- or \nfour-person family outing to the theater. While it was still \nunclear how successful this supposedly one-time “strategy \nshift”49 was for Disney, some estimates suggested that it may \nhave been a relatively successful experiment,50 despite pira-\ncy,51 boycotts,52 and critical reviews.53 By contrast, Tenet, a \nmuch-anticipated movie by acclaimed director Christopher \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

She looked toward the end of 2020 \nand the holiday season, wondering what was in store for \nNetflix. The future of the streaming business was already \nbecoming more uncertain due to the proliferation of compet-\ning services and the continued growth of alternative media \nformats like TikTok and Twitch, as well as substitutes such \nas video games. Now, with the impact of COVID on the pro-\nduction of new content and customer behaviors, it was even \nmore unclear what the “post-COVID” world would look like. \nSurely, Netflix stood to benefit in the short term from more \nfamilies staying at home and relying on media that they could \nconsume without going outside. But how durable would this \ngrowth be once, for instance, a vaccine became widely avail-\nable? Similarly, how would customer attitudes change as the \npandemic continued, and after it passed?\nIn terms of Netflix’s business model, high-quality IP was \nbecoming increasingly difficult and costly to acquire, but \nNetflix had made big bets on its ability to do so on a global \nscale (Exhibits 8, 9, and 10). The company spent approxi-\nmately USD15.3 billion on content in 2019, with 80% of its \ncontent spending allocated to produce original content in \n2020. It released 371 shows and movies in the United States \nalone in 2019, a 55% year-over-year increase. But as Netflix \nventured further into the business of production and awards \nshows, did it risk increasing exposure to the traditional \n“blockbuster”-driven industry, where many failed invest-\nments were offset by a small number of huge successes? \nWould investing in high-quality content alone be enough, \nor did Netflix have to reconsider what value it provided to \nits members?\nOne thing seemed almost certain: growth would have to \ncome from abroad.55 In order to capture these opportunities, \nthough, Netflix had to stave off competition from interna-\ntional services, such as Amazon Prime, Disney+, and soon, \nHBO Max, as well as countless local competitors in nearly \n200 countries. Riding the wins of positive quarterly reports \nfor the first half of 2020, now was as good a time as any to \nseriously consider what the future held in store for the com-\npany as it moved its global streaming business forward.\nExhibit 8  Netflix’s Spending on Content (in billions of  \nUS dollars)\n2.40\n2013\n2014\nNote: E = estimate.\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020E\n3.18\n4.90\n6.88\n8.90\n12.04\n15.30\n17.30\nExhibit 9 Original Content Hours Produced by Netflix\n8\n73\n115\n304\n666\n1,257\n1,537\n2,769\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nOriginal Content Hours\nExhibit 10  Original Content Titles Produced  \nby Netflix\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n1\n16\n23\n65\n162\n300\n240\n371\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

A research report had found that \nwhile consumers had the same adrenaline rush from material \nacquisitions, the methods of acquisition had changed.2 Over \nthe last two decades, consumers had been reducing their pur-\nchase of physical goods as a percentage of their total house-\nhold expenditure, and instead, spending more on services \nand experiences. They preferred to access physical goods on \na needs basis, in a shorter timeframe. There was a similar \ntrend in the B2B sector as well; businesses had been lowering \nthe share of illiquid assets like property, plants, and equip-\nment as a fraction of their assets, and outsourcing more activ-\nities.3 Was this change in consumer preferences permanent \nor transient? Could firms offer their products using alterna-\ntive means (for instance, as a service) to take advantage of \nthis change? NIO’s CEO and founder, William Li, was likely \nbetting that the change in consumer preferences was indeed \npermanent.\nOn August 9, 2021, NIO shares rebounded 3.1% to reclaim \nthe 50-day and 200-day moving average indicators after a \n16% fall in stock price the previous month.4 NIO was one of \nthe strongest competitors of Tesla in the electric vehicle (EV) \nmarket in China. While 100% of the firm’s sales came from \nChina, it had plans to expand globally in the near future.5 Many \ninvestors and stock analysts in the market were closely watch-\ning NIO to see if it could mirror the path Tesla had taken to \nbecome a strong global competitor. While Tesla was the clear \nleader across all markets in the EV sector, the competition was \nintense, and NIO had launched battery-as-a- service (BaaS) \nas its unique selling point to attract consumers and compete \nagainst rivals. In a press release, William Li had stated, “We \nbelieve products and technology must change along with the \nway people use them and their entire ownership experience. \nWe want consumers to feel optimistic about owning a car.”6\nNIO had launched BaaS in 2020 to offer battery charging \nand swapping services to EV owners for a small monthly sub-\nscription fee. BaaS users could buy a NIO car without the \nbattery, resulting in savings of more than US$10,834 (CNY \n70,000)7 on all NIO models.8 This brought the EV to a similar \nprice bracket as fuel-run cars, making it attractive to a wider \nrange of consumers. It also improved NIO’s price compet-\nitiveness against larger EV manufacturers like Tesla in the \ncutthroat market.9 Moreover, it allowed the firm to enjoy the \nsubsidies that had been extended by the Chinese authorities \nin April 2020 to EVs priced below US$46,400 (CNY 300,000) \nif they supported battery swapping.10 The Chinese govern-\nment had offered these subsidies with the stated intention of \naccelerating the move from fossil fuel vehicles to EVs.\nEVs were an important element of the strategy in the \ntransportation sector to act on climate change and contribute \ntowards a circular economy. They offered a more environment \nfriendly and sustainable way of life to consumers, and NIO and \nTesla were leading the way in producing next generation EVs. \nThere was also an increasing push from environmental agencies \nto allow used batteries from EVs to be reused for other projects \n(like home solar) to extend their shelf life, and only discard-\ning them once their full usage capabilities had been extracted.11 \nHence, the BaaS service was seen as an effective solution to \ncombat the environmental impact of batteries. Individual car \nowners did not own and dispose the batteries; instead, the \nvehicle manufacturer would retain the batteries for reuse and \ndisposal. Managing the usage of batteries at an organisational \nlevel ensured that batteries could be reused in a more environ-\nment friendly manner. BaaS was also useful to the consumers \nliving in smaller houses/apartments where they did not have \nthe infrastructure to charge their cars.12\nHowever, setting up the infrastructure to support BaaS \n(i.e. charging and swapping stations at various locations) \nwas an expensive affair.13 Moreover, these stations could be \nused for charging only NIO cars and not other EVs. Besides, \nthe technology for batteries had improved to the extent that \nthey could last longer in terms of miles travelled based on a \nsingle charge, reducing the need for frequent recharge/swaps \nat charging/swapping stations. Given the scenario, was NIO’s \nBaaS venture a sustainable business model? Could it provide \nthe company with a strong competitive advantage?\nClimate Change, Electric Vehicles  \nand the Circular Economy\nEVs had seen growth primarily because of the climate change \nagenda, which had been a topic of international discussions \nfor the last two decades. A global panel on climate change \nhad forecasted a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahr-\nenheit over the next century due to global carbon emissions \nwith transport accounting for around one-fifth of the total \nemissions.14 Road transport accounted for three-quarters of \nThis case was written by Professor Shantanu Bhattacharya and Lipika Bhattacharya at the Singapore Management University.

Many large auto \nmanufacturers also entered the EV market and launched new \nall-electric models in several consumer categories.19\nEV sales increased from 17,000 in 2010 to 2.1 million by \n2019, with China accounting for 47% of the global sales.20 \nThe global EV market was expected to grow to 125 million \nvehicles by 2030 (refer to Exhibit 1 for Global EV Growth).21 \nMany traditional auto manufacturers had started to focus \npurely on EV models and halt traditional car manufacturing \nfor the future. For example, General Motors had set targets \nto stop selling new gasoline-powered cars and light trucks by \n2035; Volvo had decided to pivot to a hybrid and all-electric \nline-up by 2030.22 23\nHowever, while EVs were expected to reduce the cli-\nmate impact and pollution problems of transport, many \nof the materials used in the batteries were toxic and rare.24 \nExhibit 1 Global EV Growth (Sales)\nSource: Roland Irle, “Global EV Sales for 2021, EV-Volumes”, EV-volumes.com, https://www.ev-volumes.com/, accessed \nSeptember 2021\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\n114%\n138%\n176%\n239%\n202%\n152%\n700,000\n600,000\n500,000\n400,000\n300,000\n200,000\n100,000\n0\n2019\n2020\n2021\nChina\nEurope\n(W&C)\nUSA\nJapan\nOther\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,200\n1,000\n1,400\nEVs\n+157%\n+197%\n+166%\n+40%\n+95%\n1,060\n413\n1,149\n387\n297\n112\n20\n14\n127\n65\n2021 H1\n2020 H1\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Nissan, for example, was \nreusing old batteries from its Leaf cars in automated guided \nvehicles used to deliver parts to workers in its factories.31 Volk-\nswagen had a similar approach; it opened a recycling plant in \nSalzgitter, Germany, to recycle up to 3,600 battery systems \nper year.32 A research study had concluded that lithium-ion \nbatteries could have a profitable second life as backup stor-\nage for grid-scale solar photovoltaic installations, where they \ncould operate for a decade or more in a less-demanding role.33\nNissan and Renault had also started reusing batteries to \nserve the household energy storage market, with  solar  panels \nin  the  UK as their core customer segment. 34 Many  third-party \nentrepreneurs had established second life battery businesses; for \nexample, energy control solution company Relectrify in Aus-\ntralia had introduced battery management systems to squeeze \nmore value out of used batteries and facilitate the transition of \nbatteries into a second life in residential solar storage.35\nHowever, while technology solutions for battery reuse \nwere advancing, economic and regulatory aspects did not \nyet provide sufficient infrastructure, framework and incen-\ntives for efficient battery cycles (refer to Exhibit 2 for fur-\nther details on the Circular EV Value Chain).36 As of 2021, \nthe global capacity of recycling EV batteries stood at 180,000 \nmetric tonnes while in comparison, just the number of EV’s \nintroduced on the road in 2019 could generate 500,000 metric \ntonnes of battery waste. Thus, it was evident that battery \nwaste posed a significant climate risk, which could dampen \nthe circular economy benefits of EVs in the long run.37\nThe EV Market in China\nChina was the world’s largest EV market by demand and sales \nvolume in 2020, constituting 41% of all EVs sold worldwide.38 \nThe country had tried to promote EVs to consumers in small \nand large cities, with the aim of reaching its carbon emission \npeak before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.39 \nEV sales in China were mostly concentrated in large cities \nwith over five million residents, like Shanghai and Beijing.40\nThe Chinese government had tried to promote EVs since \n2009 by offering subsidies, tax waivers, and charging points \nto encourage manufacturers and consumers. It had also \nimplemented other measures like licensing policies to limit \nthe number of petrol cars on roads using a car plate lottery \nsystem, with winning rates as low as 1% or below, thereby \nforcing consumers to switch to EVs. 41 However, consumers \n(especially in smaller cities) were still not keen, primarily \nbecause of EV’s higher costs compared to traditional vehi-\ncles.42 The price of a standard five seater fuel based top-tier \ncar was about US$ 34,150 (Nissan Altima)43; whereas the price \nof an EV was more than double that amount (Tesla Model X \nfor example was around US$ 89,900)44.\nDemand for cars in China was on the rise and analysts \nhad predicted that over 70% of new car sales (including EVs) \nglobally would come from China by 2030.45 Chinese buyers \nwere big fans of SUVs, especially of models from global \nluxury brands like Mercedes, BMW, and Audi. Tesla was the \nundisputed market leader of the EV market in China, focus-\ning on mass market and luxury cars, and accounted for about \n51% of the EV sales in early 2020.46 NIO accounted for 16% of \nmarket sales in the same period and focused on luxury cars. \nThe bestseller in the market, however, was Hongguang Mini \nEV (a micro car built by a local manufacturer), which sold \nabout 270,000 units in 2020.47\nThe EV market in China had mainly flourished because \nof government subsidies that enabled local original export \nmanufacturers (OEMs) to sell EVs at affordable prices. How-\never, EV sales had plunged after the Chinese government cut \nsubsidies by up to 50% in June 2020. The overall sales of new \nenergy vehicles (including EVs) in China had dropped by 7% \nyear-on-year after these subsidy cuts, marking the first fall in \nthis market after more than two years.48\nHowever, despite the pullback of subsidies, the China EV \nmarket had managed to regain its surge by early 2021. Ana-\nlysts predicted that the country would continue to maintain \nits leading market position for the next decade.49 EV sales in \nthe country were driven by government policy and increased \nconsumer demand, as EV prices continued to decline while \nits quality continued to improve. Analysts believed that Chi-\nnese producers would start to target international buyers in \nthe coming years, given that they already had a head start on \nmanufacturing at scale over the West and that government \nsubsidies to the industry were starting to decline.50\nNIO\nNIO was founded by Chinese entrepreneur William Li in \nShanghai, in November 2014. Hailing from a low-income \nfamily in a rural province in eastern China, Li had humble \nbeginnings.51 He grew up in the mountains with his grand-\nparents and herded cattle as a child. After graduating with a \ncomputer science degree from Peking University, Li took on \nseveral part-time jobs to support himself, before venturing \nout as an entrepreneur. In 2000, he launched auto informa-\ntion website Bitauto, which listed its IPO in 2010 and raised \nUS$127 million on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).52\nLi then went on to establish NIO in 2014, as he believed \nthat there was a growing opportunity for new entrants in the \nEV sector. The company’s Chinese name Wei Lai meant “Blue \nSky Coming”, and originated from a vision of a future filled \nwith blue skies. The company believed that improved smart \nelectric car technologies, coupled with better experience of \ncar ownership, could drive increased appreciation and adop-\ntion of smart electric cars, leading to a more sustainable \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

His company’s first EV product was a sports car named \nEP9, which boasted of an attractive design, high driving per-\nformance, powerful acceleration, and state of the art technol-\nogy.55 The EP9 quickly gained popularity as a premium car and \nmotivated NIO to launch its first mass manufactured model, \nES8, in 2017. The ES8 was a 7-seater SUV aimed at the luxury \nautomobile market. As NIO did not have its own manufactur-\ning plant, it collaborated with state-owned auto manufacturer \nJianghuai Automobile Group Co (JAC) to build the vehicles. \nBy 2018, NIO had captured 19% of the market in China.56\nIn September 2018, NIO went public and raised US$1.8 \nbillion from its IPO on NYSE.57 It then launched another SUV \nmodel, the ES6, a five-seater high-performance premium \nelectric SUV. Soon after, in December 2018, NIO launched a \nfive-door, five-seater crossover SUV ES9 with a sloping rear \nsection and the largest panoramic sunroof ‘in its class’ (refer \nto Exhibit 3 for NIO EV models). User experience was key to \nNIO, as Li had shared,\nThe user experience is not only about the functional expe-\nrience of the car - like acceleration, speed, and power, but \nalso about the emotional experience. If you want to rede-\nfine the industry and the product, you must redefine the \nyouth experience of the industry. In all industries in the \nfuture, user experience of a car brand should include four \nparts: car parts, service, digital touchpoint, and beyond \nits life, what the car will bring to you.58\nAfter a few successful years, NIO faced troubled times, in \n2019, when the Chinese government started to pull back sub-\nsidies for EV manufacturers. Withdrawal of subsidies, along \nwith the departure of a few key executive and vehicle recalls, \nhurt NIO’s business dramatically, plummeting investor con-\nfidence in the company. Shares dropped from an IPO high \nof US$6.26 in 2018 to a low of US$2 in 2019.59 Notably, NIO \nrecalled nearly 5,000 of its ES8 high- performance electric \nSUVs after a series of battery fires in China, followed by a \nsubsequent investigation that revealed a vulnerability in the \ncar model that posed a safety risk.60\nTo cope with the difficulties, NIO sought additional \nfunding, and found a new lifeline when the local government \nof Hefei agreed to invest US$1.08 billion (CNY 7 billion) in \nthe company. Li subsequently set up a joint venture manufac-\nturing unit (with state-controlled automaker JAC Motors) at \nHefei, the capital of Anhui province in China, in 2020. The \ndeal also involved the building of an EV industry park, called \nNeoPark, in collaboration with the Hefei government to pro-\nduce one million cars annually.61\nFollowing its deal at Hefei, NIO gained renewed momen-\ntum and quickly recovered from its business slump in 2019. \nIn the first quarter of 2021, vehicle sales at NIO accounted \nfor revenues of US$1.1 billion (CNY 7.4 billion), representing \nExhibit 3 NIO EV Models\nRobert Way/Shutterstock\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

We have offices in Shanghai, \nMunich, London, and Silicon Valley. We targeted the China \nmarket first, but we intend to target other global markets \nalso. We have more than 1,000 people outside China.64\nIn May 2021, NIO entered Norway, its first expansion over-\nseas since its inception. Norway was the first country in the \nworld to have higher sales of EVs compared to traditionally \npowered vehicles. In 2020, EVs accounted for nearly 55% of \nall car sales in the country.65 NIO’s strategy was to use Norway \nas a springboard for its expansion into Europe – which was \nthe second largest market for EVs globally following China. \nBy 2022, NIO aimed to enter five more European countries, \nto cater to an estimated demand of 95,000 vehicles yearly. EVs \nwere supported by subsidies in the European market to drive the \nregion’s commitment to climate change and NIO was hoping to \ntap on this support to expand in the market. Establishing bat-\ntery swapping stations and offering BaaS services formed a key \npart of NIO’s strategy in Europe, just as in China.66\nBattery Swapping and BaaS\nBattery swapping in the EV industry was not a new concept. \nThe industry had tried and tested several ways of designing an \neffective solution for battery swapping to overcome the high \ncosts of charging and replacing batteries. The first approach was \nintroduced in 2007 by an Israeli start- up called Better Place that \nallowed its customers to switch their batteries in a fully auto-\nmated station using a membership card.67 In 2013, Tesla had \nintroduced a swapping station, where consumers could drive \nin to get their batteries replaced.68 However, consumers in the \nU.S. (Tesla’s biggest market) were not impressed with this solu-\ntion and preferred to use home and public chargers, given their \nlifestyle and the conveniently available infrastructure of public \ncharging stations. Both Tesla and Better Place dropped their \nswapping approaches eventually, as it did not make business \nsense to build stations when consumer demand was minimal.\nIn China, battery swap technology had already been tested \nfor personal and commercial vehicles in five cities before it \nwas launched by NIO.69 However, although swap stations \ntried to replicate the experience of existing gas stations, there \nwere still issues that prevented their widescale implementa-\ntion.70 Most swapping stations were concentrated in larger \ncities like Beijing and the cost of installing a charging station \nwas huge – approximately US$500,000. Moreover, swapping \nCarrie Fereday/Shutterstock\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

It could reduce the peak consumption of \nelectricity by centralised charging and avoided grid over-\nloading due to mass EV charging. Empty batteries could be \ncharged when electricity was cheap and demand was low. \nBattery swapping was also quick to execute and typically took \na couple of minutes. Additionally, providing swapping ser-\nvices as a BaaS to consumers helped reduce the risks related \nto inefficient battery disposal.72\nNIO BaaS\nNIO had realised early in its business that batteries could add \nsignificant costs to EVs, which were competing against tradi-\ntional fuel-run cars in the market. Removing the cost of the \nbattery from the product could reduce its price significantly \nand potentially increase its attractiveness to consumers.73 \nMaking batteries more affordable, accessible and reusable was \nalso necessary from the circular economy perspective and for \nrealising the Chinese government’s ambition of having one in \nfive vehicles driven by non-fossil/non-fuels by 2025.74\nNIO batteries were manufactured using cell-to-pack tech-\nnology, to achieve an energy density that was higher than a \nconventional battery pack by about 37%.75 The batteries were \nalso lighter and used 40% fewer components than standard \nbatteries.76 All batteries were monitored by a cloud-based bat-\ntery management system, which included features like thermal \npropagation prevention and smart parameter adjustments for \nenvironment conditions to improve battery performance.77 \nConsumers who brought a NIO EV with the battery could \nenjoy lifetime free battery swap services and out-of-town free \npower services of up to six times per month.78 Battery charging \nand swapping services were offered to consumers using an \nintegrated power solution.\nThe NIO power solution consisted of four comprehensive \nbattery services: a home charging solution (Power Home), a \nbattery exchange (Power Swap) service at swapping stations, \na mobile charging service provided through on-call service \ntrucks (Power Mobile), and a 24-hour on- demand pick-up \nand drop-off charging service (Power Express). NIO vehicles \nwere also compatible with publicly accessible charging net-\nwork in China of over 214,000 charging piles, 59.6% of which \nwere superchargers (fast chargers).79\nAlthough NIO had home charging solutions for its bat-\nteries, very few homes in China had the infrastructure to sup-\nport installation of home charging points, as a majority of its \nEV consumers were from large cities and lived in high-rise \ncondominiums.80 Hence, NIO realised that to attract more \ncustomers, it would have to focus more on the option of \ncharging the EV batteries in a swapping station. The govern-\nment had also launched a support scheme in 2020 to promote \nthe setting-up of swapping stations to lure more consumers \nto buy EVs, in a bid to control pollution from fuel-based \nvehicles.81 These reasons further motivated NIO to expand \nits swapping station network and offer BaaS services to its \nconsumers.82\nIn early 2020, NIO started offering subscription plans for \nits battery services, which would allow consumers to buy its \nvehicles without the battery. Removing the battery reduced \nthe purchase price of the NIO vehicles by over US$10,834.83 \nIn the subscription plan, buyers would pay a monthly fee \nof US$152 (CNY 980) to lease a battery and could use free \ncharging and swapping services as part of the BaaS subscrip-\ntion.84 The services were offered through a mobile internet- \nbased solution that managed an extensive network of battery \ncharging and swap facilities.\nNIO had opened its first battery swapping station in 2018; \nhowever, it took a few years for its battery swapping services \nto accelerate interest amongst consumers. By October 2020, \nNIO had completed one million swaps and by May 2021, it \nhad completed two million swaps.85 By June 2020, NIO had \nbuilt 135 swap stations across 59 cities in China.86 However, \nthe number of swapping stations were far below NIO’s origi-\nnal plans of setting up 1,100 units by 2020. This slow growth \nwas attributed to NIO’s cash flow crisis in 2019, which was \nalleviated through its subsequent deal with the local govern-\nment of Hefei.87\nThe power swap locations were connected through its \nautomated power solution across numerous cities in China to \nprovide improved battery supply and services at its swapping \nlocations. The automated solution also inspected every bat-\ntery pack removed from a vehicle for electrical performance \nbefore recharging it for the next user. If a fault was identified, \nthe battery was taken out of circulation and sent for repairs.\nIn terms of footprint, NIO swapping stations were as \nlarge as three parking spaces. The changing process was fully \nautomatic; the car was driven into the station where it was \nserviced by a car lift-battery replace system that replaced the \nbatteries automatically.88\nKey Features of NIO BaaS\nNIO’s bet on BaaS hinged on several key factors. Firstly, the \nbattery swaps at the swapping station were fast; on average, it \ntook three to five minutes for a battery swap – replacing the \nexisting battery in the vehicle with a fully charged battery, \ncompared to 75 minutes for a full charge at a supercharger.89\nSecondly, the battery swaps were also slightly cheaper \nthan other battery alternatives for EVs. NIO’s service offered \nsix swaps a month in its monthly subscription price, which \nprovided about 1,500 miles of range. The math for the sub-\nscription amounted to US$0.10 per mile, which was slightly \nlower than the estimated US$0.104 per mile cost for using \nTesla superchargers.90\nThirdly, swapping batteries also motivated NIO cus-\ntomers to opt for battery upgrades when a more advanced \nbattery pack was available, which helped preserve the car’s \nperformance and resale value and mitigate broader con-\ncerns of battery degradation.91 In order to ensure that new \nbatteries could fit with old cars, NIO had standardised its \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

NIO’s BaaS had helped in this aspect by allowing the \ncompany to invest in battery technology without worrying \nabout replacing older batteries.\nBaaS also created two sources of revenue - a monthly \nrecurring revenue from battery service subscriptions and the \nother from upgrade requests for newly launched batteries. By \nearly 2021, approximately 40% of NIO owners had already \nopted for battery subscriptions. 92 With approximately 75,500 \nNIO EVs on the road, analysts estimated that the subscription \nservice generated about US$4.5 million in monthly recurring \nrevenue, or US$54 million in annual revenue.93 This reve-\nnue was expected to increase further as NIO expanded pro-\nduction, increased subscription penetration among existing \nPrice Benefits\nES8\nEC6\nES6\nSeats\n70-100kWh\n70-100kWh\n70-100kWh\nMSRP\nUS$ 73,389 to\nUS$ 82,484\nUS$ 57,736 to\nUS$ 66,836\nUS$ 56,167 to\nUS$ 65,267\nPost-Subsidy Price\nUS$ 70,884 to\nUS$ 79,701\nUS$ 55,194 to\nUS$ 64,012\nUS$ 53,626 to\nUS$ 62,443\nPrice with BaaS\nUS$ 59,901 to\nUS$ 59,619\nUS$ 44,212 to\nUS$ 43,930\nUS$ 42,643 to\nUS$ 42,361\nExhibit 4  NIO EV Price with BAAS\nSources: NIO, “Battery as a Service”, https://www.nio.com/baas, accessed September 2021.\nNIO Battery Swap Station\nSource: Flickr Commons, https://www.flickr.com/commons/usage/, accessed September 2021.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

But \ndespite being one-ninth the size of Tesla and overcoming a \nnear brush with bankruptcy in 2019, NIO had posted a 190% \nyear over year delivery growth in quarter two, 154% growth \nin quarter three, and 111% growth in quarter four of 2020.100\nTesla possessed a much larger manufacturing capacity \nthan NIO, and owned four operational factories in Fremont, \nNevada, New York, and Shanghai (with Fremont and Shang-\nhai producing vehicles and the other two producing solar/\nbattery technology). Tesla’s global production had increased \nby 39.6% year-over-year to 509,737 units by 2020.101 The \nautomaker’s success was mainly driven by an increase in EV \ndemand in China (where the economy had recovered quickly \nfrom the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic) and an expansion \nof demand in the US.\nTesla started manufacturing in China at its Shanghai \nPlant in 2019 to promote local vehicle production, reduce \ncosts, and expand its profit in China. Notably, the company \nhad delivered 137,000 EVs in China and posted an increase of \n28.3% on its revenues year-over-year, hitting US$31.5 billion \nin 2020.102 In comparison, NIO operated only one factory, \nwith an annual capacity of around 90,000 vehicles, and had \ndelivered 36,721 vehicles in 2020. The company had plans to \nincrease its manufacturing capacity to 240,000 vehicles per \nyear by 2021.103\nTesla’s supercharger network had also helped strengthen \nits competitive moat. Setting up a supercharger station was \nless expensive than a swapping station and could cost between \nUS$100,000 to US$ 175,000.104 The company had installed \n6,000 supercharging stations in China and more than 20,000 \nsuperchargers globally. However, analysts had argued that \nthese numbers were not enough for its customers, as there \nwere over 1.2 million Tesla vehicles on the road worldwide.105 \nOwners in high density areas were often plagued with long \nlines as demand for the Tesla chargers exceeded supply. \nBesides, each charging session could take on average 45-50 \nminutes leading to long wait times and congestion at the \nstations.106\nIn contrast to Tesla’s charging stations, many industry \nanalysts perceived NIO’s BaaS as a powerful competitive \nstrategy. Battery swaps were not only more time efficient than \nbattery recharging, but also easy to provide as a subscription  \noffer, enabling the manufacturer to sell the vehicle at a cheaper \nprice by removing the price of the battery and offering  \nit as a service. Swaps also provided fully charged batteries \nthat could last for a longer range (about 380 miles) than a \nrecharge (a 45-minute recharge provided about 228 miles) at \na supercharger.\nBoth Tesla and NIO provided battery packs of 100 \nkWh, and while Tesla intended to continue providing sim-\nilar weightage batteries in the future, NIO had plans to start \ndelivering 150 kWh battery packs in 2022107, which could fur-\nther reduce charging costs.108 However, Tesla was also trying \nto implement battery cost reduction measures, albeit with a \ndifferent strategy, and this posed a threat to NIO’s BaaS. Tesla \nhad plans to produce lithium-ion batteries in-house at half \nthe cost of its existing batteries with an annual production \ncapacity of 100 GWh batteries (for 1.4 million EVs) by 2022.109 \nTesla was also trying to enhance its partnerships with battery \nsuppliers and directly source materials for the batteries to \nbring down battery costs.110\nAdditionally, Tesla was planning to launch fully autono-\nmous cars in the near future, as it felt that this was the ensuing \nfate of the automobile industry.111 NIO had similar predictions \nfor the future, and had announced a partnership with artificial  \nintelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia, to accelerate progress \ntowards building autonomous cars.112\nDespite Tesla’s large lead, analysts believed that regulators \nwere unlikely to favour a monopoly in the EV market, and \nsmaller competing companies like NIO could benefit from \nregulatory controls and remain in the run.113 In markets like \nChina, government strategies to build internal competition \nand bring down prices of EVs significantly could further curb \nTesla’s growth in the future.114 Overall, analysts predicted that \nmarket competition in the EV sector would continue to be \ncutthroat, with new emerging players having ample oppor-\ntunities to capture market share.115 This posed a promising \nmarket for existing players like NIO, as well as new incum-\nbents planning to enter the EV market.116\nBattery Technology: A Possible Game \nChanger?\nIn addition to its niche BaaS strategy, NIO had also used a \ndiversification strategy to remain competitive in the market, \nand stand up against Tesla. Beyond EVs, NIO had diversified \nits business in 2018 and added two new businesses under its \nbelt – NIO House and NIO Life. NIO House was a concept \nstore with home design products that gelled with NIO cars \nto provide owners an opportunity to become connoisseurs of \nNIO designs.117 Similarly, NIO life was an e- commerce mobile \napp selling NIO lifestyle products to consumers, aimed at \nexpanding NIO’s brand philosophy.

Nonetheless, many analysts had \nopined that while NIO’s BaaS and large-scale implementa-\ntion of swapping stations could provide the company with an \nimmediate advantage in the market, it was unlikely to provide \nmuch competitive sustenance over the long run.119 This was \nprimarily because battery technology was evolving rapidly \nand charging times were predicted to reduce dramatically in \nthe near future.120\nEV’s with lithium-ion batteries were expected to give way \nto vehicles with lithium-iron phosphate and other technolo-\ngies that could cut costs, extend vehicle ranges to 400 miles or \nmore between charges, and enable batteries to last as long as a \nmillion miles.121 EVs were expected to become more useful as \ntheir ranges increased, and provide a better value proposition \nbecause the batteries could have resale value and last longer \nthan the cars they were sold with. This was also in line with \nthe goals of governments and industries to move towards a \ncircular economy.\nAdditionally, new EV technology could make elec-\ntric vehicles as cheap as those powered by petrol, and the \nEV price would no longer pose a cost barrier.122 On a sep-\narate note, analysts had raised concerns over NIO’s battery \nswapping strategies, arguing that setting up battery swap-\nping infrastructure and swapping stations was expensive, \nand hence needed to fulfil long-term needs of consumers to \nmake business sense.123 However, with the battery technol-\nogy advancing so quickly, it seemed unlikely that swapping \nstations would remain relevant over the long time horizon.124\nAmidst such strategic concerns, would it make more \nsense for NIO to halt its battery-swapping infrastructure and \nfocus on the battery technology itself? Alternatively, could \nNIO continue to benefit from its BaaS services, and make it \nits winning strategy? How could it explore opportunities with \nBaaS to make its EVs more sustainable in the future? What \nother strategies could NIO explore to compete with the EV \ngiant Tesla? Would the battery-swapping model continue to \nbe relevant in the future? In which other industries could bat-\ntery swapping prove to be a plausible business model? Could \nthe as-a-service model help propagate a circular economy?\nExhibit 5  NIO House Store\nSource: Flickr Commons, https://www.flickr.com/commons/usage/, accessed September 2021.\nWerner Rebel/Shutterstock\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

From 2012 it was named “World’s Best \nChocolate” at the International Chocolate Awards in London \nfor five consecutive years. Certified Fair Trade, kosher, and \norganic, Pacari chocolate is used by top chefs including Chile’s \nCarolina Bazan and Rodolfo Guzman, Colombian chef Jorge \nRausch, Michelin-starred chefs Martin Berasategui, Paco \nPerez, and Maria Jose San Roman, And Ecuador’s Carolina \nSanchez. It was also a favourite of Oprah Winfrey.\nBy 2021, with net sales expected to reach US$6 million \nand a staff of 77, Pacari was present in 42 countries, selling \n67 different SKUs ranging from cocoa powder to chocolate \nbars (see Exhibits 1, 2 and 3). It was unique in terms of its \nquality, ethical standards (see Exhibit 4) and origin—100% \nEcuadorian from the farm to the final product.\nThe challenge was now to take Pacari to the next level—\ntargeting revenues of US$20 million by 2026 (see Exhibits 5 \nand 6).\nOrigins of the Global Chocolate \nIndustry\nThe word “chocolate” comes from the Aztec “xocoatl”—which \nsignifies a bitter drink brewed from cocoa beans. The Latin \nname for the tree, Theobroma cocoa, means “food of the gods”. \nChocolate consumption is believed to date back 4,000 years \nto pre-Colombian cultures of Mesoamerica and the Olmec,3 \nalthough recent research suggests that Ecuador’s cocoa heri-\ntage could date back 5,200 years, 1,700 years before it reached \nMexico.4 Beans were used as currency in ancient times, when \nthe Mayans and Aztecs believed they had magical properties. \nFollowing the Spanish colonization of the Americas, cocoa \nbeans came to Europe (see Exhibit 7). By the 20th century, the \nword ‘chocolate’ applied to a range of products—often richer \nin sugar, milk powder and additives than cocoa, and made \nfrom the hardiest (but least flavour-some) beans.\nIn the 21st century, a growing interest in high-quality, \nnon-industrial chocolate derived from sustainably grown cocoa \nwas transforming the industry. For example, Hershey’s expanded \nits artisanal chocolate line, purchasing smaller producers known \nfor premium chocolate such as Scharffen Berger and Dagoba, \nand independent chocolatiers continued to flourish.5\nBy 2020 the global chocolate confectionery market was \nworth US$106 billion, up from US$100 billion in 2015.6 It \nwas dominated by six conglomerates that together accounted \nfor 57.7% of the market: Mars Inc. (13.7%), Mondelez \nInternational (12.5%), Fererro International (10.7%), Nestlé \nSA (8.9%), Hershey Co (6.6%) and Chocaledefriken Lindt \n(5.3).7 These global chocolate giants bought cocoa directly \nfrom farmers (through tier 1 suppliers who worked with \nfarmers’ cooperatives) and semi-processed cocoa from pro-\ncessors. (Note: “Cocoa” refers to the tree, the beans, and the \npowder. “Chocolate” refers to the processed product).\nSource: Pacari.com\nThis case study was written by Amitava Chattopadhyay, Professor of Marketing and the GlaxoSmithKline Chaired Professor of Corporate Innovation at INSEAD, \nFabrizio Noboa and Alexandra Velasco, both Professors at Universidad San Francisco de Quito, USFQ Business School, Anne-Marie Carrick, Senior Research \nAssociate, and Andrew Lee, Research Associate, both at INSEAD.

Three \nplayers dominated the processing industry: Barry Callebaut  \n(1.02 million metric tonnes), Cargill (750K metric tonnnes), \nand Olam (950K metric tonnes). It was a capital-intensive, \nlow-margin business.\nChocolate is sold in various formats. In 2020, tablets8 \nwere the most popular, with sales exceeding US$28 billion, \ncountlines US$25 billion, boxed assortments US$18 billion, \nand chocolate pouches/bags US$17 billion. The majority is \nsold in supermarkets, hypermarkets and independent gro-\ncers. Chocolate is mass produced and mass consumed. The \nSwiss have the highest per capita consumption (see Exhibit 8) \nand the US is the world’s largest importer.9\nThe Cocoa Supply Chain and Players\nCocoa requires special conditions to grow, which are mainly \nfound in the region 20° north and south of the equator \n(the 20/20 zone). There are many steps involved in making \nchocolate, from cultivating the trees, harvesting the beans, \nto packaging the confectionery (see Exhibit 9). First, farm-\ners grow, ferment and dry the beans. Some are organized in \ncooperatives/associations, but most are independent. The \nbeans are transported to exporters, traders and processing \ncompanies, which roast, grind and transform them into \nsemi-finished cocoa products (liquor, butter and powder) for \nuse by chocolate manufacturers.\nThere is a vast divide between producers and consumers—\nthe former living in poverty, the latter indulging their love \nof luxury products.10 In 2020, Ivory Coast was the largest \nexporter of cocoa, accounting for 43.9% of global exports \nworth US$2.37 billion, while neighbouring Ghana had \n14.17%. The two countries were home to 2.5 million cocoa \nfarmers who earned less than a dollar per day (well below the \n‘poverty line’ of US$1.90). An estimated 1.5 million children \nworked in cocoa production, often illegally.11 The problem \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

European taste buds found the \nbitter taste unpleasing and added sugar. By the 17th century, chocolate had become a fashionable drink throughout Europe \nwith its nutritious, medicinal and allegedly aphrodisiac properties. It remained, however, a luxury product reserved for the \nwealthy. With the invention of the steam engine, enabling mass production in the late 1700s, chocolate became more accessi-\nble to the masses.\nIn 1828, a Dutch chemist discovered how to make powdered chocolate by removing half the natural fat (cocoa butter) \nfrom chocolate liquor, pulverizing the remainder, then treating the mixture with alkaline salts to remove the bitter taste. \nHis invention, “Dutch cocoa”, led to the creation of solid chocolate. In 1847, Joseph Fry learned how to make a mouldable \nchocolate paste by adding melted cocoa butter to Dutch cocoa. By 1868, a company called Cadbury began marketing box-\nes of chocolate confectionery in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later, pioneered by the Swiss company \nNestlé.\nExhibit 5 Imports of Chocolate by Country\n5.21\n3.09\n2.08\n2.02\n1.74\n1.67\n1.44\n1.42\n0.97\n0.86\nGermany\nBelgium\nItaly\nNetherlands\nPoland\nUnited States\nCanada\nFrance\nUnited Kingdom\nSwitzerland\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nUS $ billion\nSource: UN Comtrade via Statista, accessed November 2020.\nExhibit 6 Principal Export Destinations of Chocolate Products from Ecuador—201839\n0\nJapan\nCanada\nBelgium\nChina\nGermany\nMexico\nNetherlands\nMalaysia\nUSA\nIndonesia\n15\n30\n45\n60\n59.678\n53.909\n48.460\n36.850\n23.892\n15.923\n15.058\n10.340\nVolume in metric tons\n8.453\n8.265\nSource: ANECOCOA, 2019 SECTOREXPORTADORDE COCOA, accessed November 2020. http://www.anecocoa.com/index.php/en/estadisticas/estadisticas-actuales.html\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The bulk \nof it—80%—was cultivated on the coast in the Manabí, Los \nRios, Esmeraldas and Guayas regions. The remainder was \ngrown in the Amazon provinces and a few plantations in the \nsouth.18\nWhile Ecuador was the source of a mere 7% of the world’s \ncocoa, it produced 45% of Fino de Aroma beans, the highest \nquality classification.19 Locally known as “Arriba Nacional”, the \nbeans were from the Forastero cocoa tree native to Ecuador \nand yielded the purest and rarest form of cocoa. Fine flavour \ncocoa (FFC) is famous for its distinct flavour (nutty, fruity \nwith a hint of orange and jasmine). The variety of the tree, \nthe type of soil and local climate influenced the flavour pro-\nfile - akin to the terroir in wine-growing regions. Attracting \ninterest from chocolatiers worldwide, FFC had secured a \ngood reputation for Ecuador’s chocolate for over a decade.\nSmall farmers (owning between one and five hectares) \nmade up 90% of Ecuador’s cocoa producers, of which \n60–70%20 lived below the poverty line. Relying on tradi-\ntional cultivation methods to grow the Arriba Nacional \ntrees, they did not use insecticides and chemical fertilizers \nand grew native plants like yams and coconuts alongside \nthe cocoa.\nExhibit 8 Global Chocolate Consumption (kg per capita) by Key Countries (2017)\nSource: Lindt & Sprüngli - Annual Report 2017, page 55 via Euromonitor and Statista 2020.\nSource: Euromonitor, 2019 Statista\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nSwitzerland\nAustria\nGermany\nIreland\nGreat Britain\nSweden\nEstonia\nNorway\nPoland\nBelgium\nFinland\nSlovakia\nThe Netherlands\nNew Zealand\nDenmark\nAustralia\nCzech Republic\nRussia\nUnited States\nFrance\nBrazil\nJapan\nSouth Africa\nChina\nMarket Share of Chocolate Confectionery\nWorldwide in 2019, by Region\nWestern Europe\n33%\nNorth America\n22%\nEEMEA*\n24%\nAsia Pacifc\n14%\nSouth\nAmerica\n7%\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Harvesting\nThe cocoa tree (Theobroma cocoa) grows in tropical climates throughout the world and has the unusual \ntrait of having both flowers and fruit on the tree at the same time. The fruit of the tree is known as the \ncocoa pod, which grows on the trunk and branches. Each pod ripens at a different time, so expertise is \nneeded in choosing the right time to pick the pod. Picking is usually done with a machete, and great care \nis needed to ensure that the flower cushion on the tree is not damaged so that more pods can grow in the \nfuture.\n2. Fermenting\nAfter the pods are opened and the beans are exposed to oxygen, the fermentation begins. The beans  \nand pulp may be contained in banana leaves or wooden boxes, which contain holes for excess liquid  \nto escape. The beans are mixed or turned to enable this process and the temperature naturally raises  \nto 40–50C. This stage is a major factor in developing the cocoa flavour and can take up to eight days,  \ndepending on the bean type.\n3. Drying\nFollowing the fermentation stage, the beans contain a high level of moisture, which needs to be reduced in order to avoid \noverdeveloping, which can adversely affect the flavour. In most origins, cocoa beans can be sun-dried. In wetter climates, \nhowever, this is not possible, so alternative methods are used. For example, in Papua New Guinea, beans are dried using open \nfires, giving them a distinctly smoky flavour. Once dried, the beans are then sorted and bagged, before being shipped to \nmakers around the world.\n4. Roasting\nThe next step is for chocolate-makers to roast their dried cocoa beans. The roasting time and temperature will vary by bean \ntype and quality, as well as the objectives of the chocolate-maker. In addition to being an important factor for flavour devel-\nopment, the roasting process also further reduces the moisture content and kills off any lurking bacteria.\n5. Cracking & Winnowing\nFollowing the roasting process, the outer shell becomes thin and brittle. The beans are then cracked manually or with a ma-\nchine, after which the shells can be winnowed from the bean kernels, also known as cocoa nibs. The cocoa nibs are used in the \nproduction of chocolate, whereas the antioxidant-packed shells can be used for other purposes, such as making cocoa tea or \neven garden fertiliser.\n6. Grinding & Conching\nThese two processes are commonly combined into one with the use of a melangeur. First, the nibs are ground into a thick \npaste known as cocoa mass. This paste consists of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter, the natural fat of the cocoa bean. \nDuring the conching stage, some chocolate-makers add extra ingredients such as sugar, milk or vanilla. This step may take \nanything from two hours to two days, and the particulars of the process are crucial as they will affect the final texture and \nflavour.\n7. Tempering\nThis is the process of raising and lowering the temperature of the chocolate so that it is formed into the right consistency \nthrough the treatment of the crystals. Without tempering, the chocolate would be dull and crumbly, missing the tempting \nSources: Cacoa Magazine, Bean to Bar: How Chocolate is Made, September 19, 2019 readcacao.com blog\nsource: https://www.icco \n.org/harvesting-post \n-harvest-new/\n(cont.)\n© International Cocoa \nOrganization\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This is traditionally done by hand but \nthe process can also be sped up with a tempering machine.\n8. Moulding\nOnce tempered, the melted chocolate is poured into the chosen mould and tapped against a \nhard surface to remove air bubbles. Craft chocolate-makers often do this by hand, while for \nlarger manufacturers the process is mechanised for efficiency.\n9. Wrapping\nAfter the chocolate has cooled and solidified it is inspected for quality control. The final bar is \nthen carefully wrapped in foil or paper packaging to keep it fresh and labelled with a best be-\nfore date and ingredients list.

From Bean to Bar\nThey also grew the hybrid \ncocoa CCN-51 variety developed \nin the 1960s by an Ecuadorian \nagronomist for its resistance to \ndisease. This accounted for 72% \nof the country’s cocoa produc-\ntion (on large-scale monoculture \nplantations) because of its higher \nproductivity. However, the cocoa \nwas more acidic and bitter than \nfine flavoured cocoa. Some man-\nufacturers refused to include it in \ntheir recipes, but others includ-\ning giants Mondelez and Barry \nCallebaut favoured its introduc-\ntion. This put FFC at risk of extinction, despite its superior \ntaste and quality.\nCocoa was the most lucrative cash crop for Ecuadorian \nfarmers. Most was exported to the US and EU as beans. The \nindustry provided jobs for 5% of the country’s economically \nactive population and 15% in rural areas. 21, 22\nEcuador’s Chocolate Industry 2020\nIn 2020, the chocolate industry in Ecuador was valued at \nUS$125.8 million.23 The largest player in the local confection-\nery market was Universal Sweet Industries (La Universal) with \n22.9% (see Exhibit 10). Manicho, a 28g chocolate and peanut \ncountline, was its most popular offering. Line extensions \nincluded bonbons, white chocolate, chocolate chip cookies \nand spreadable chocolate. Second was Nestlé Ecuador (11.1%), \nthen Unidal Ecuador (subsidiary of Arcor of Argentina; 10%), \nCia Nacional de Chocolate (8.1%) and Ferrero del Ecuador \n(5.6%). Smaller producers, including Pacari (3.8%), had \nbegun to take a share of the domestic market.\nPacari—A Global Brand from Ecuador\n“Made in Ecuador with local and international flavours. \nPacari means Nature in Quechua”24\nPacari was the brainchild of Carla Barboto and Santiago \nPeralta, who in 2002 created SKS Farms, building on Carla’s \nexperience of organic farming gained during a year study-\ning in Vermont, USA. They sold organic flowers to the USA \nthrough Whole Foods but became disillusioned by consumer \nattitudes—customers were less concerned about the envi-\nronment and more about themselves. Helping the environ-\nment wasn’t enough; they needed personal benefits from the \npurchase. This prompted them to expand to organic fruit, \nvegetables and cocoa, since consumers were increasingly \nconvinced of the benefits compared with industrially farmed \nand genetically modified produce.\nAlthough SKS Farms processed cocoa from 2003, it was \nonly in 2008 that Pacari was launched25 as the first brand \nto manufacture premium, single-origin, organic chocolate, \n100% from Ecuador. When they started Pacari, the couple \nhad no training in the cocoa and chocolate sector. Within six \nyears they were exporting bars and “challenging the market \nand mentality of a globalized world.”26 Pacari was the first \nchocolate company to receive biodynamic certification from \nDemeter International.27\nBuilding a Sustainable Cocoa Farming \nCommunity\n“Each bar of chocolate is the result of a human process. It \nis the manifestation of the soul of the community, inspired \nby a sustainable and ancestral culture of chocolate.”28\nFrom the outset, Carla and Santiago were determined to be a \n“tree-to-bar” operation – “From the farmer to the consumer” \nwas a statement not a slogan. They couldn’t understand why \nEcuador exported beans and imported chocolate.\n“We cut out the middleman, we traded directly with small \nproducers at a time when no one was talking to these \nguys. They were the losers in the big export game—and \nno one was talking vegan, biodynamic, or organic. We \npaid above market prices, offering an incentive for quality \ncontrol and loyalty.”29\nhttps://www.pacari.com \n/sustainable-cacao-community \n/?lang=en\n© International Cocoa Organization\n© Pacari.com\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

In search of suitable partners, \nSantiago travelled to the regions of Los Rios, Esmeraldas and \nManabi, where the climate and type of soil would make for \nvariations in flavour. He also contacted small-scale farmers \nwho cultivated from one to ten hectares with the biodiversity \nto enhance flavour variations. These farmers used traditional \nfarming practices (without chemicals, pesticides or industrial \nfertilizer). This ensured that Pacari chocolate would be chemi-\ncal-free even if farmers were not yet officially certified organic.\nIn his quest to find suitable cocoa, Santiago discovered \nthe harshness of the farmers’ existence. Trapped in a cycle of \npoverty, it was hard for them to save any money. Getting paid \nonce a year in July meant that by December they were strug-\ngling financially. To generate more income, many farmers \nhad shifted to cultivate CCN-51 cocoa trees to ensure higher \nproductivity. The price difference between FFC and CCN-\n51 cocoa was insignificant.30 Their previous experiences had \nleft farmers wary—some collectives had been robbed of their \nproduce based on outsiders’ knowledge of when the cocoa \nbeans had been fermented, dried and were ready for sale. \nOthers had been approached by buyer organisations that did \nnot follow through on their propositions.\nBuilding trust was therefore the first priority, if Pacari was \nto persuade them to work towards organic certification. Carla \nexplained:\n“The going farm-gate rate at the time for non-certified \norganic [chemical free] beans was US$70 per quintal \n[100Kg], but we offered US$150. Once they are certified \norganic, we paid US$200. This is a great incentive for the \nfarmers to persevere with the organic certification plan—\nand we help them obtain this. This ensured that all the \ncocoa we used was organic even though a small portion \nhad not yet been officially certified.\nIn the countryside there is no credit, and the farmer has \nto pay cash for everything. Therefore, at the beginning \nwe paid 100% in advance. However, this did not allow us \nto reward or penalise according to good or bad quality: \nExhibit 10 Competitive Landscape in Ecuador Chocolate Market (% value share)\nSource: Euromonitor, Chocolate Confectionery in Ecuador, 15 September 2020.\n34.9%\n1.3%\n1.9%\n2.5%\n4.7%\n6.3%\n6.6%\n8.0%\n10.0%\n23.9%\nOthers\nFábrica de Chocolates Bi...\nMondelez Ecuador C Ltda\nQuifatex SA\nDipor SA\nUnidal Ecuador SA\nFerrero del Ecuador SA\nCia Nacional de Chocolat...\nNestlé Ecuador SA\nUniversal Sweet Industri...\nUniversal Sweet Industries (La Universal) is Ecuador’s national manufacturer of confectionery.

Later, we agreed to pay 50% down with \nthe remainder on receipt of the product. This way, we did \nnot affect the farmer’s income stream, but we could adjust \nthe payment if necessary, according to the bean quality, \nalthough we very rarely returned dried cocoa beans.”\nThe higher rate encouraged farmers to work with Pacari \nand cultivate the Arriba Nacional beans. Pacari could sup-\nport farmers willing to switch back to the Arriba Nacional \ntrees thanks to a loan earmarked by the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank. The renaissance of these high-quality \nbeans that had become endangered put Pacari on the map.31\nInitially, Pacari could not purchase the farmer’s entire \ncrop and encouraged farmers to sell beans to other chocolate \ncompanies on condition they received the same price that \nPacari offered. Carla noted:\n“We made not only a change in the pricing of cocoa but \nin the mindset of cocoa farmers in Ecuador. Pacari has \nhelped farmers recognise the worth of their products and \ndemand higher rates for their beans—to ask for more, \nwhether it’s from Pacari or another buyer. By paying \nhigher rates, we also discourage farmers from focusing \non short term goals that produce lower quality beans for \nthe sake of higher yields.”\nPacari supported farming communities through training and \ninfrastructure to improve bean quality. This was crucial for \nfarmers who lacked the facilities for the post-harvest process \nand had to pay high rents during that part of the season. The \npresident of one farming community in Santa Rita described \nhow their lives had been transformed through Pacari’s support:\n“Before meeting Santiago in 2012, our community had \nnever fermented our beans. We would often dry our cocoa \nbeans on the roadside. Santiago taught us new methods for \nthe post-harvest process and built us fermentation boxes \nand cots for drying the beans. They also taught us how to \ngraft new shoots onto older trees. Through methods like \nthese we have seen a significant increase in our yield.”\nPacari taught the farmers how to become biodynamic—an \nintegral part of its philosophy. An expert trained the farmers \non site once a year, customised according to the climate and \ntype of soil in each region. Not all the farmers were certified \nbiodynamic, but the expert helped them to use the relevant \ntechniques. Carla explained:\n“Teaching the farmers biodynamic agriculture is good \nbecause it is a holistic way of agriculture. The require-\nments are stricter than organic as the entire farm needs \nto be treated with biodynamism, not just a specific plant \nor product. At the same time, biodynamic agriculture is \nless expensive as we teach the farmers how to prepare \nand apply biodynamic fertilizer on their own so that they \ndon’t need to purchase additional fertilizers.”\nFarmers working in coops cultivated their own crop, and \nwhen ready to sell, sold the pods to the coop. The coop \nreceived an advance from Pacari, visually checked the beans \nto ensure there was no fungus and the flesh was white, paid \nthe farmers, then fermented and dried the cocoa before deliv-\nering the dried beans to Pacari’s factory in Quito, which paid \nthe transport cost of the five-hour journey.\nOnce they reached the factory, 100 beans were sam-\npled. If 85% were fermented it was considered fine cocoa. \nThey were tasted to ensure the desired flavour. If a \nfarmer tried to sell Pacari low-quality cocoa, he would be \nthwarted by stringent quality checks and reminded that \nhe could only get better rates for high-quality cocoa. The \nbeans were inspected visually and organoleptic tests were \nused to verify quality.32 Standards were high and certified \nproducers had to follow strict guidelines to assure organic \nproduction.\nInitially, Carla and Santiago had no idea about processing \nbeans and making chocolate, but they came to believe it was \nfor this reason that they went beyond the industry “standard”, \nlearning by trial and error—an approach “that generates a \nbetter chocolate”.33 Santiago noted:\n“We learned alongside the farmers, designing equipment \nto better ferment and grind cocoa beans. It gave us a real \nunderstanding of how production affects flavours. We \nbegan getting fantastic quality.”\nThey invented their own machines to clean and roast the dried \ncocoa beans, experimenting with different levels of roasting \nand grinding to determine what gave the best flavour. They \ntook single-origin cocoa batches to capture interesting fla-\nvour profiles by blending beans from different “terroirs” such \nas Esmeraldas, Los Rios, and Manabi, launching varieties \nnamed after the terroir. As the first tree-to-bar, single-ori-\ngin organic chocolate made in Ecuador, their reputation was \nbuilt on local ingredients, with flavours such as Andean rose, \nguayusa and wild blueberries from Imbabura.\nAll elements of the process came under scrutiny to \nensure they were humane and sustainable. One example \nwas changing the weight of cocoa bags–145lbs–which dated \nfrom the era of slavery when it was considered the most a \nperson could carry. Carla and Santiago cut the size of the \nbags by 50lbs.\nAs community was of upmost importance, once the final \nproduct was ready, they took samples to the farmers who had \ncultivated the cocoa. Santiago noted:\n“It was the first time they had eaten the chocolate they \nhelped create. Each farmer involved with Pacari is part \nof our team. Pacari is more than a chocolate brand. It is \na brand of people. Pacari’s success is the farmers’ success. \nEach award that Pacari has won is translated into recogni-\ntion for the brand and visibility for the farmers.”\nThe result was that farmers started to take pride in their pro-\nduce as representatives of Ecuadorian cocoa worldwide.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

This and other awards helped the farmers \ntoo, as it signaled high quality to potential buyers. Community \ncollaboration led to the construction of an information centre \n(Ruta de Chocolate y Cocoa) where tourists could learn about \nthe history of cocoa and the Quechua culture.\nOriginally, Pacari sold bulk products including cocoa \nliquor/ paste (pure cocoa mass in a solid or semi-solid form), \npowder (cocoa beans that were ground into a powder) and \nnibs (chips of crushed cocoa), but this did not generate the \nvalue they sought. Santiago explained:\n“Some of the companies we were supplying used our \nproducts to develop high-quality products such as choco-\nlate bars and then raked in the profits. One company was \neven bought by Hersheys for US$16 million after using \nPacari’s paste.”\nSo Pacari shifted from bulk products to a branded business. \nWith bulk products, institutional sales had represented 90% \nof the business; after the change in focus this fell to 20% and \nbranded products accounted for 80%. This generated a 15% \nincrease in volume. Santiago noted:\n“I want to build a relationship with the final consumer. \nOnce a final consumer gets hooked on Pacari and its phi-\nlosophy, they will become an ambassador for our brand. \nThis wouldn’t be possible if we focused on bulk products. \nIn two years, we probably won’t be selling any more bulk \nproducts. This is also to avoid competition from other \nbrands using Pacari to develop their own products.”\nBy 2021, Pacari’s factory was producing 40,000 50-gram bars \na day, with the capacity to double production, and was on a \npath to tripling it.\nBuilding the Brand\nEntering the market for branded chocolate was ambitious \ngiven that it was saturated. Pacari needed to differentiate \nitself in terms of consumer perceptions by developing a \nbrand that reflected the company’s mission and values. Its \nphilosophy (Exhibit 11) echoed the founders’ approach to \nlife: respect the basic principles of Mother Earth by caring \nfor it and giving back the life it provides. They believed in \ncommunity and sustainability as the new norms for busi-\nness, and in the core values of respect, trust, leadership and \nsustainability. In line with this, the name Pacari was chosen, \nmeaning “dawn” or “nature” in Quechua-speaking countries. \nSantiago explained:\n“Dawn means the beginning of a new day, which is our \nstory—where we change all this blindness. Dawn is the \ntime light is coming and we will see things clearly. Nature is \nanother beautiful word that is applicable because everything \nwe do is related to nature; we are sustainable. After this we \nput in ‘premium organic chocolate from tree to bar’.”\nThe design of the logo was based on a petroglyph dating back \n5,000 years.\n“The man and a tree depict the story of a farmer and \nfood. The farmer takes care of and fixes the tree, and the \ntree feeds the farmer. It portrays a joyful and simplistic \nrelationship. It also supports the trend ‘you are what you \neat’ and reflects our brand and personal story.”\nThe product offerings were equally distinctive:\n“The market is full of cheap chocolate, but we are creating \na niche of quality products. Mass-produced chocolate is \nboring. Customers are looking for something with per-\nsonality, like the wine industry 25-30 years ago. Little by \nlittle it is changing as more people are educated about the \ndifferent flavours and terroir. If you put together some \nnew flavours, such as one we just launched with juniper, \nwhich is really like a gin tonic—it’s fantastic. But no one \nhas done that before. Why? Because the industry has been \nkind of lazy about introducing new products and refresh-\ning the market” (see Exhibit 12).\nConsistent with its name and philosophy, Pacari began using \nbiodegradable packaging in 2019 (that would decompose in \n180 days, unlike plastic that takes centuries).\nAt the Pacari store, customers were encouraged to purchase \nproducts by weight (including cocoa powder, coconut sugar, \nchia and organic muesli). People who purchased chocolates \n“paper-free” by using their own container received a discount.34\n“We want to create awareness in consumers and in indus-\ntries. We have found a way to offer a quality product that \ndoes not pollute the environment. Our business model \n‘From the tree to the bar’ supports our mission of respect-\ning the principles of the earth, caring for it and giving \nback what it gives us.”35\nBrand Communication\nWord of mouth was key to promotion. Carla and Santiago \nwanted the Pacari story to be meaningful for the con-\nsumer. They did not invest in advertising, preferring to \nbuild relationships with well-known chefs such as Martin \nBerasategui, Paco Perez, Maria Jose San Roman and \nCarolina Sanchez, who were committed to quality and sus-\ntainability and could act as influencers. Santiago explained:\n“These chefs are people who really care. They buy from \nus because they love the product, our story and philos-\nophy. Our marketing is through these ‘chef influencers’ \nOur product is good, but the chefs are also drawn by the \npersonal relationship we have built with them and who \nalso support the ethics behind the business…it’s a differ-\nent way of getting word out about the Pacari brand.”\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Santiago travelled to these \nevents until the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, switching \nto zoom sessions with “chocolate kits” sent ahead of the vir-\ntual meeting:\n“I was doing zoom chocolate tastings at least once a week, \nincluding tastings with some well-known chefs worldwide. \nOne, was with a Michelin-starred chef from a restaurant \nin Jayda in Spain, who is Ecuadorian, and knows many \nother Michelin star chefs. This led to a Michelin star \ntasting—we wouldn’t have been able to reach so many \npeople so quickly without these zoom tastings. It has also \nsaved me time and money by not travelling.”\nExhibit 11 Pacari Mission and Values\n“Turning back to its natural state by respecting the basic principles of Mother Earth. Simply \nby caring for it, and by giving back the life it provides. That is our mission, through organic \nhabits, fair trade, and biodynamics we want to create new forms of agricultural practices.”\nRespect\nFor us, the history of our products and our chocolate is a unique treasure. That is \nwhy, in our processes, we are always looking out for the rich historical heritage: \nOUR COCOA.\nTrust\nWe work directly with more than 3500 small-scale farmers. By working without \nintermediaries, we generate trust and transparency giving them fair prices for their \nproduct. We also share knowledge about organic and biodynamic processes, which \nallow them to obtain a better product while taking care of their piece of land.\nLeadership\nWe have become a reference of quality and production processes in the category. \nBy prioritizing the producer and helping him to generate quality crops in an organ-\nic way, he can take care of his land and his future.\nSustainability\nIt is fundamental for us to generate a positive impact in the world. It is our responsibility to promote a sustainable and \nharmonious development, alongside with our producers. Together with nature, sharing culture and sustainable practices to \nwhoever is listening.\nSource: Pacari, Know Our History, 2019, https://www.pacari.com/history/?lang=en\nCarla Barbotó and Santiago Peralta Source: Pacari,  \nKnow Our History, 2019, https://www.pacari.com \n/history/?lang=en\nExhibit 12 A Selection of Pacari’s Tropical Flavours\nSource: Pacari.com\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

It was featured in news \noutlets like Nat Geo, CNN, NBC News, channel T13, The \nNew York Times and the like.\nTo reach the end consumer, beyond the chefs who \nacted as influencers through mentioning Pacari chocolate \nin their social media posts, Pacari promoted their posts on \nits Facebook page. Chefs were given personalized gift boxes \n(with the name of their restaurant) containing samples that \ncould be given to celebrity guests in the hope they would \npromote Pacari on social media. Pacari used Instagram  \n(85K followers on its Spanish language account) and Google \nads, as mass media advertising was beyond its reach.\nIn Ecuador, tastings were held at the Pacari flagship store \nin Quito, targeting shoppers, F&B personnel and distributors. \nOpened in 2019, the Pacari Experience House sold the products, \nhad an in-house café, and offered cocoa tours and chocolate \ntastings. By 2021, Pacari had opened two more outlets in Quito, \nwith sales accounting for 15% of the company’s total. New prod-\nucts were tested in the shop, offering an opportunity to observe \ncustomers’ reactions “live”. Santiago explained how it worked:\n“There is no single medium but many layers that have \nallowed us to build the Pacari brand. Holding tastings at \nevents, and at our store, where before the pandemic, we \ncould have 2–3 times a day, allowing us to get people to \ntry our chocolate and understand the story behind the \nbrand and what we are trying to do.\nHaving these tasting trials has helped us to gauge what \ntype of products we will develop in the future, for exam-\nple, the forthcoming Nutella-like product that we are pro-\nmoting. It’s an organic cocoa-based spread with hazelnut \nthat we are prototyping in the shop. Another example is \ncoconut sugar and other types of non-chocolate products. \nWe also sell vegan ice cream. So it’s not just about selling \nchocolate, but all the products where we can discuss the \norganic process of cocoa. That’s why we call it the ‘Pacari \nexperience house.’”\nA mere 3% of sales came from its online platform, with the \nremaining 79% from supermarkets. According to the larg-\nest supermarket in Ecuador, Pacari dominated sales of dark \nchocolate with 70% market share,36 commanding a premium \nprice per gram over the most popular brand of chocolate in \nEcuador, Manicho.37\nChallenges\nBy the beginning of 2021, Pacari was selling more directly \nto consumers, removing the middlemen, “some of whom \nwere not helping us”. In the US, it was distributed through \nAmazon, which provided a platform to reach discriminating \nchocolate lovers and also provided fulfilment services.\nHowever, if Pacari was to grow from revenues of US$6 \nmillion in 2021 to US$20 million by the end of 2026, it had to \naddress the following issues:\n1. Was the positioning that had helped achieve US$6 mil-\nlion in sales sufficient to reach its goal of US$20 million? \nShould the company modify its positioning and leverage \nits roots in sustainability more aggressively?\n2. While its manufacturing capacity was easy to scale to \nmeet revenue goals, could Pacari source a sufficient quan-\ntity of organic Arriba Nacional cocoa beans to triple the \ncurrent volume?\n3. Should Pacari continue to focus on all 42 countries where \nit had a presence, or should it be more selective? If so, \nhow should it identify which ones to focus on?\n4. Consumer knowledge of Pacari remained low and dis-\ntribution was difficult in markets beyond Ecuador. How \nshould it grow brand awareness outside its home market \nwhere it did not have connections to celebrity chefs to act \nas influencers?\n5. Despite visibility from its PR efforts how could Pacari be \nmore strategic in its efforts to gain media attention?\nExhibit 13 Pacari Awards\nSource: Pacari, Know Our History, 2019, https://www.pacari.com/history/?lang=en\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

For \ncenturies it has been integral to the economy of the Bel-\ngian city and vice versa. It is a major hub for the import \nand export of liquids, dry bulk and containers at the centre \nof a vast network of inland waterways, railways and road \ninfrastructure.\nTraditionally, the Port Authority acted primarily as a \nlandlord, awarding concessions to companies for indus-\ntrial operations, warehousing and other terminal activi-\nties, but its new ambition was to position itself as a com-\nmunity builder, facilitating connections between its many \nstakeholders for their mutual benefit and to ensure that the \nport remained an attractive cargo destination and would \ncontinue to provide jobs for over 144,000 workers in the \nfuture.\nOriginally, the market leader for handling break bulk \nand dry bulk, the Port of Antwerp was host to a rich \necosystem of industrial companies that had chosen it as a \nbase for logistics reasons. Antwerp hosted Europe’s larg-\nest chemical cluster, with refineries such as BASF, Total, \nExxon, Ineos, Covestro and others. The port’s importance \nas a logistics hub extended throughout north-west Europe. \nGoods arriving from overseas were shipped via barge, rail, \npipelines and road, while goods from across the hinter-\nland were transported to Antwerp to be shipped overseas. \nContainer traffic was a big part of the success story and \nhad seen spectacular growth.\nYet the port was falling victim to its success. Despite \nsteadily increasing infrastructure, increasing capacity was a \nchallenge – it took years for new capacity to become oper-\national. The growth in size of container vessels meant that \nit had to handle larger cargo sizes and longer operating \npeaks at the terminals, compounding the capacity problem. \nContainer transit was also subject to uncontrollable factors \nsuch as weather and river levels, culminating in a capacity \nshortage on the maritime quays of the main terminal and \n© Port of Anvert\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

On average, a barge visited \nsix terminals in the port area (maritime terminals, empty \ndepots, mixed terminals), with containers to load and \nunload at one or more, and regularly lost up to three days \nin delays. In the absence of service level agreements (SLA) \ncontracts with the terminal operators, barge owners had \nto wait for a free slot. Delays were compounded through-\nout the chain all the way to the end-customer, leading to \nhigher logistics costs, the risk of deep-sea vessels sailing \nwithout cargo, and freight handlers switching from barge \nto road transport, which increased congestion. The costs \nfrom delays – an estimated EUR 48 million per year – were \nabsorbed by the barge operators.\nIf the port were to get a reputation for delays, shippers \nwould go elsewhere and the container supply chain would \ncollapse. Despite various projects to optimize cargo han-\ndling in the port, there was a need for a more proactive \napproach and systemic change.\nThe Port of Antwerp\nThe Port Authority offered concessions, typically for 50 years, \nto industrial companies and logistics operators. It had over-\nsight of all the companies and stakeholders in the port (see \nExhibit 1). Antwerp handled different types of freight cargo, \nincluding break bulk,2 rolling material, liquid bulk, dry bulk \nSource: Port of Antwerp\nExhibit 1 The Port of Antwerp Showing the Maritime Terminals\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

It was Europe’s market leader \nin handling steel and fruit and coffee storage, and the largest \nintegrated chemical cluster.\nAmong its strengths was its pragmatic, flexible approach. \nWhereas the port of Hamburg refused to accept cargo \nwithout the correct import/export paperwork on arrival, \nAntwerp was willing to accept cargo and allow the paper-\nwork to be obtained thereafter. Located 80km inland on the \nRiver Scheldt, as the furthest inland port in Europe it offered \nfreight forwarders fast and inexpensive connections to the \nhinterland through multiple modes of transport: road (56%), \nrail (8%) and barge (36%). The aim was 42%, 15% and 43% \nrespectively by 2030.\nExhibit 1 shows the locations of the Deepsea Container \nTerminals. From the Scheldt estuary it took eight hours to \nsail to the terminals – deep-sea vessels being steered by a \npilot rather than the ship’s captain.\nAntwerp’s Link to Inland Waterways3\nMore than 550 million tonnes of cargo were shipped across \n40,000 km of inland waterways in Europe (Figure 1). The largest \nriver, the Rhine, had two thirds of the volume of transport on \nthese waterways (300 million of a total 550 million tonnes). It was \npart of the Rhine-Alps corridor that stretches from the Nether-\nlands to Italy via Germany, France and Switzerland. Bordered by \ndensely populated economic and industrial regions, it has been \na vital part of transport and industry for centuries. The North-\nSouth axis of inland waterways from northern France through \nBelgium and the Netherlands accounted for almost 20% of the \ntraffic volume (100 million tonnes per annum). Large waterways \ninclude the Rhine and canals between the Netherlands and Bel-\ngium, where up to 300 TEU can be carried. As a main hub for \nhinterland traffic within Belgium and with the Rhine corridor, \nthe Port of Antwerp had a competitive advantage.\nFacts about the Antwerp port area\n \n●\nSurface area: Right bank 6,784 hectares / Left bank 5,284 hectares\n \n●\nLength of roads: 358 km\n \n●\nLength of railway lines: 1,047 km\n \n●\nLength of pipes: 1,000 km\n \n●\nLength of quays: 169 km useful mooring length, 120.6 km of quay walls\n \n●\nNumber of locks in use: 7\n \n●\nNumber of bridgets: 24\n \n●\nNumber of docks: 40\n \n●\nNumber of terminals: 86\nANTWERP\nAntwerp stands out as a multifunctional world-class port thanks\nto the presence not only of handling and logistics companies but\nalso industry within the port.

Hamburg, \nAntwerp and Rotterdam the three largest. Hamburg’s hinter-\nland connections were less strong than Antwerp’s and Rotter-\ndam’s Antwerp accounted for 76% of the total freight volume \nof Flemish ports. Rotterdam, 100km to the north, offered \neasier access for maritime vessels due to its location on the \ncoast. Rotterdam serviced 14,595 maritime vessels and 52,000 \ninland vessels a year. Its connections with the hinterland were \nstrong, sharing Rhine cargo with Antwerp, and it employed \n385,000 people (directly or indirectly). It was developing a \nContainer Exchange Route (CER), leveraging data from com-\npanies in the port, that will bundle containers so that trains, \nbarges and feeder vessels will no longer have to call at all ter-\nminals individually.\nA significant threat to all North Sea ports was increased \nChinese investment in European ports as part of its ‘Belt and \nRoad’ initiative, with control moving eastwards. Of the top \n10 busiest ports in the world, seven (including Hong Kong) \nwere in China, with Singapore (#2), South Korea’s Busan \n(#7) and UAE’s Dubai (#9). Rotterdam was 11th, Antwerp \n14th, Hamburg 19th, and Bremerhaven 27th. Chinese compa-\nnies had stakes in terminals in Rotterdam, Antwerp, and \nHamburg. China’s COSCO held a majority 51% stake in the \nPort of Piraeus in Greece. It planned to make Piraeus the big-\ngest commercial port in Europe and a strategic hub between \nEurope, Asia and Africa. Ships from Asia typically transit via \nthe Suez Canal and cross the Mediterranean before heading \nto the North Sea ports.\nFuture Trends\nAntwerp had to plan for increases in future demand \nto remain competitive, taking the following trends into \naccount.\nIncreasing Demand\nContainer traffic was largely handled by three companies, \nPSA, DP World and MPET. There were also mixed termi-\nnals and empty depots. Demand for container freight grew \nsignificantly in the last decade.\nThe Energy Transition and Implications for \nMultimodal Transport\nThe Port was aware of emissions and climate targets from the \nEU – emissions from port operations as well as from road \nhaulage. The European Parliament had called on the Euro-\npean Commission to encourage and increase multimodal \ntransport, strengthening inland waterways as a priority.4\nShifting Economics and Powerbase of \nDifferent Modes\nThe container freight value chain involved a large number \nof stakeholders (Figure 2) who worked with various \narrangements/conditions but not necessarily a contractual \nrelationship. The majority of barges in Antwerp were con-\ntracted by shippers in the hinterland, who had no contracts \nwith the shipping lines. Merchant haulage in Europe \naccounted for up to 80% of total inland freight, with car-\nrier haulage the remainder.5\nOver the past decade, consolidation between shipping \nlines had resulted in three alliances – Ocean Alliance, The \nAlliance, and 2M Alliance6 - together accounting for 80% \nof the overall container trade and 95% of total ship capacity \non East-West trade lanes.7 Further consolidation was likely. \nThanks to SLAs with the terminal operators, shipping lines \ntook priority over barges at terminals.\nFor short distances, competition between trucks and \nbarges was high. Whereas trucks could transport a single \nTEU container from point to point, with barge transport, \nlast-mile handling by truck had to be added to the cost. \nOver longer distances, rail and barge were more attractive. \nThe largest barges could transport up to 330 containers to \nvarious destinations in the European hinterland. Barges \nbenefit from economies of scale and the ability to stop at \nports along the way. In every mode there was significant \ncompetition, which drove down freight prices. This trend \nwas likely to continue.\nWhile shippers largely decided who to contract with, \nthe influence of shipping line alliances was increasing. \nThey could easily switch port networks and within a port \ncould create competition between terminal operators and \nbetween other port service providers, potentially driving \ndown margins and lowering rates of return on investment \nfor the port industry.8\nFigure 1 Hinterland Links from the Port of Antwerp\nSource: Port of Antwerp\nAntwerp\nAmsterdam \nRotterdam\nDuisburg\nDüsseldorf\nCologne Germany\nKoblenz\nFrankfurt\nMannheim\nLudwigshafen\nStrasbourg\nOttmarsheim\nSwitserland\nBasel\nMulhouse \nNancy\nMetz\nThionville\nLiege\nBelgium\nBrussels\nFrance\nValenciennes\nDourges\nLille \nZeebrugge\nParis\nBonn\nLuxembourg\nMainz \nNetherlands\nBremerhaven\nNorthern France\n24 to 36 hours\nNetherlands\n6 to 18 hours\nLower Rhine region\n18 to 24 hours\nMiddle Rhine region\n24 to 72 hours\nBelgium\n4 to 18 hours \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Between 1968-2014 container capacity increased 1,200%, and \nthe trend would continue. As vessels grew larger, they required \nlonger quays and taller cranes to load/unload them. Not every \nterminal could accommodate the largest ships. At some ports the \nwater level was too low to accommodate heavier vessels. Larger \ndeep-sea vessels meant larger call sizes and increased peak times \nin the terminals, compounding capacity issues.\nA decade earlier, vessels made more calls in Europe, vis-\niting different ports. The new trend was to use terminals as \n‘hubs’ to transship cargo to further destinations in Europe \nserved by smaller seagoing vessels. To enjoy scale benefits, \nvessels had to be full, which was not easy to achieve. Over-\nloading the hinterland was another concern. Whether by \nbarge, truck or rail, it added further pressure on inland infra-\nstructure, creating delays and road congestion.\nAutomation\nThe degree of automation differed across the terminals in \nAntwerp, but there were no fully automated ports. Auto-\nmation covered three main areas:\n\t\n●\nPort gates – identifying and recording every truck enter-\ning or leaving the port. Additional security checks, veri-\nfication and customs\n\t\n●\nShip-to-shore cranes – for loading and unloading, deployed \nin some ports\n\t\n●\nStacks and inventory – unmanned stackers operate on the \nquayside and in the yard\nPort management software supported terminal operators \nfor port and business operations. Terminal operations \nincluded planning and scheduling of ship movements \nto quayside berths, registration and follow-up vessel call \ndetails. Yard operations included location of containers \nand accompanying detailed instructions. Planning of \nberths considered ships’ size, the buffer required between \nvessels, and number of cranes (and of gangs) to unload and \nload a vessel. This meant knowing how much cargo to \nunload/load and scheduling tugboats to get the vessels in \nand out of the terminal. Further automation and digitiza-\ntion was likely throughout terminal operations.\nNotes\n1. Equivalent to 20,000 football pitches. \n2.

Laseter, Professor of Practice, and Aldo Sesia, Senior Case Writer. It was written as a basis for \nclass discussion rather than to illustrate effective or ineffective handling of an administrative situation.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality, so please submit any errata to editorial@dardenbusinesspublishing.com\nIn October 2021, Miles Arnone, CEO of Re:Build Manufac-\nturing (Re:Build), was at the Warrior Ice Arena, the practice \nfacility of the National Hockey League’s Boston Bruins, and \nthe home ice of the Boston Pride women’s professional ice \nhockey team.1 Arnone, who with partners had bought the \nNational Women’s Hockey League team in 2019, was sitting \nin one of the bright yellow seats as the Zamboni resurfaced \nthe ice before a practice session. He faced the rink, on the \nfar side of which gigantic windows opened to a view of the \nMassachusetts Turnpike with cars and trucks whizzing by. \nArnone’s thoughts were elsewhere. Re:Build’s leadership was \nconsidering acquiring one of three platform companies. He \ncontemplated the pros and cons of each candidate company \nand anticipated discussing with his colleagues the results of a \nscreening exercise, just one element of Re:Build’s acquisition \ndecision-making process.\nFounding Hypothesis and Thesis\nRe:Build’s founders hypothesized that technological and geo-\npolitical developments were rendering conventional indus-\ntrial enterprises obsolete, and that a range of technical and \nmanagerial advances could dramatically enhance the per-\nformance of small- to mid-sized industrial and engineer-\ning-centric enterprises. They believed that advances had not \nbeen systematically applied to this cohort and that geopo-\nlitical developments, environmental concerns, and market \ndemand for rapid fulfillment and increased customization at \nmass-production prices would reshape the commercial land-\nscape, creating opportunity for a new industrial model. Their \nthesis was that industrial enterprises had to shift to a new \nform of conglomeration built around technology-enabled \ncollaboration. They thought such a shift was necessary for \nAmerican small- to mid-sized manufacturers if they were to \nsurvive, because the next wave of competition would come \naround the deployment of common technologies that would \nbe difficult to master at the local level. In Re:Build’s model, \nenabling technology companies (ETCs) embodied these \ntechnologies. ETCs did not need to be large. Their capabili-\nties were to be leveraged in platform companies, which was \nwhere scale was most important to achieve. Re:Build defined \nplatform companies as ones of moderate to substantial scale \nwhose processes and/or products could be dramatically \nimproved by the integration of technologies from adjacent \nindustries.\nWhile platform companies could also be improved \nthrough a workplace design methodology like Lean’s 5S \nsystem of continuous improvement, Re:Build considered \nsuch an initiative to be a necessary but not sufficient ele-\nment for success. Suitable platform companies would need \ntechnological enhancement of their products or services, \nand Re:Build would need to own or control that technology. \nAcquired platform companies would leverage enabling tech-\nnologies and services to increase the value of their own offer-\nings. The adoption of enabling technologies by the platforms \nalso increased the value of ETCs (see Exhibit 1).

However, by the second decade of the new millennium, \nthe skills and resources that differentiated conglomerates \nwere broadly available. For example, private equity was pro-\nviding large amounts of capital and expertise to stand-alone \nbusinesses, while IT systems (e.g., enterprise resource plan-\nning [ERP], customer relationships management [CRM]) \nwere more affordable and accessible through cloud comput-\ning. “We believe that the industrial conglomerate is ripe for \nreinvention,” Arnone said. Danaher’s 2016 division into two \ncompanies (the new one was named Fortive) and GE’s 2021 \nannouncements that it planned to split into three businesses \noffered evidence that the old industrial conglomerate model \nhad run its course.\nMission and Philosophy\nIn 2020, Arnone and Jeff Wilke launched Re:Build. The \nidea was to help create a new model for rejuvenating the \nUS industrial base by acquiring companies with the inten-\ntion of very tightly integrating them with other businesses \nand leveraging technical capabilities across the companies. \n“When we buy a company, we anticipate that we will never \nsell it,” Arnone said. “It does not mean we would not sell \nit, but we have a long-term holding horizon.” Arnone was \nquick to point out that Re:Build was not a private equity \nfirm. (Exhibit 3 highlights how Re:Build differed from pri-\nvate equity, according to the company.) “It is not a portfolio \napproach to acquiring businesses,” he explained. “Our goal \nis to acquire businesses that we can essentially have collabo-\nrate in a way that generates additional value and benefit for \nthe customers and the shareholders and employees as well.” \nAccording to Arnone, Re:Build was very focused on creat-\ning jobs; he acknowledged the challenge: “As you can imag-\nine there’s a natural tension between automation and jobs.  \nOur view is that there’s also a lot of advances in technology \nand management that can enhance the performance of small \nExhibit 2 Examples of Enabling Technologies and Capabilities, Described by Re:Build\nRapid production methods such as 3D printing that can disrupt manufacturing paradigms.

You need a different \nway to go about that than just slinging inexpensive labor \nat the problem. Our approach is to invest in advanced \ntechnologies that can drive substantial, meaningful \nchange in products or production processes, and then \nacquire and build businesses around those technologies \nthat we can improve by deploying that technology across \nthese businesses. Much industrial power and prowess \nhas moved to China and Asia. If 25 years ago you said \nthat this would be the situation, few people, if any, would \nhave believed you. I think that there can be substantial \nshifts to bring work back, even today, because there are \na lot of levers in the United States in the way the country \nis organized, in terms of the economy, the government, \nthe educational system, and the use of technology, that \ncan give us a lot of industrial capability and power and \nthe ability to grow.2 . . . We have to use technical lever-\nage, we have to identify technologies before they are \nultra-mature and then use those as to drive business, \nand we are going to have to do that, over and over and \nover again.\nThe Re:Build Way\nArnone and the company’s leadership (see Exhibit 4) wanted \nto establish values and principles by which it and the com-\npanies it acquired would operate. These leaders established \n16 tenets that they called the “Re:Build Way” (see Exhibit 5). \nWhen Re:Build was considering a company to acquire, these \ntenets were a focus of discussion. Arnone explained,\nEnsuring that our values and our principles are aligned \nwith prospective companies is essential. Literally, the \nfirst meeting we attend with the prospective company’s \nmanagement team, I bring The Rebuild Way with me. \nWe walk through that, and we say, “look there’s lots of \nSource: Unless otherwise noted, all exhibits based on company documents, used with permission.\nExhibit 3 How Re:Build Differed from Private Equity\nLong Investment Horizon—achieving our goals requires a timescale that closed-end PE funds cannot accommodate. Private \nequity reward structures can drive “buy and flip” behavior, which in this context would depress long-term value and \nleave money on the table.\nTruly Thesis-Driven—Re:Build is an industrial tech pureplay. Substantial value is derived from thesis-driven buildout of plat-\nforms vs. investment banker-driven opportunistic deal execution.\nTight-knit Collaboration Drives Value—Private equity firms need to isolate entities for re-sale, and therefore rarely rely on co-\noperation between different platforms to achieve returns. Valuation, incentive and time-line issues drive management \nteams at PE firms apart rather than together. Re:Build drives value generation through cooperation across the firm.\nCulture—Because PE investments are independent “islands” and hold times are short, less effort is typically put into building  \na sustainable, value-driving culture. A strong, consistent, corporate culture is a core element of the Re:Build strategy.\nthings that are negotiable, but our values and principles \nare not.” We work with companies to make sure that they \nare going to be comfortable with our values and princi-\nples. We only bring companies into the fold that we think \nare compatible around those areas.\nFor example, our use of the Re:Build Way led us to a \nvery effective policy of bringing standardization around \nCOVID-19 practices to our plants given different \nsites and geographical biases. We’ve moved our busi-\nnesses’ vaccination rates up and had to also undertake  \nsome tough decisions with respect to management at \none site.\nOnce it acquired a business, Re:Build gave that company’s \nleadership a measure of autonomy. “We don’t want to have \ntotal top-down management, because when you do that, you \naccelerate the rate at which you calcify and then you decel-\nerate the rate at which you can accept new innovation,” said \nArnone.\nCorporate Service Layer\nStill, Re:Build had a corporate service layer, which leadership \nconsidered an important feature and was key to generating \nvalue for ETCs and platform companies Re:Build acquired. \nCorporate services included operations and engineering \nmanagement (i.e., Lean, Six Sigma, standardized operating \npractices and systems), recruiting (C-suite, middle manage-\nment, project-oriented staffing), strategy and governance, \nfinancial expertise and access to capital, networking across \nthe value chain, expert guidance and context, shared services \n(e.g., ERP, CRM, and so on), and M&A.\nTwo Tracks\nRe:Build acquired and built businesses along two tracks: \nETCs and platform companies.

During the first year post-acquisition (Phase 1),  \nthe corporate service layer helped to prepare the ETC to \nsupport platforms by professionalizing and streamlining \noperations, scaling management and processes, and refining \nproduct and service offerings. (All this could be undertaken \nin the context of current existing businesses.) Afterward \n(Phase 2), the ETC was ready to support platform compa-\nnies and to provide services, products, equipment, or other \nsupport to reposition and redefine the target businesses. \nThis process, Re:Build leadership believed, benefited the \nETC by driving commercially oriented relationships, pro-\nviding deep customer insights, and allowing further refine-\nment and expansion of the ETC’s technical and business \ncapabilities.\nPlatform companies tended to be larger ($25  million \nto $100 million in sales) and were targeted for acquisitions \nbased upon Re:Build’s ability to upgrade their performance \nby operational enhancements, driving efficiencies, and \nthe adoption of technology from in-house ETCs. Platform \ncompanies were sourced through more conventional chan-\nnels (e.g., investment banks) with the understanding that \nRe:Build’s application of ETC technologies would drive them \nto higher levels of sales, profitability, or both. Sourcing took \nplace in the context of a well-developed thesis. During Phase \n1, post-acquisition, the acquired company would utilize the \ncorporate service layer to grow and improve operations (such \nas refine management and strategy and implement opera-\ntional best practices, and so forth). Phase 2 commenced once \nan ETC was ready to transfer or integrate technology to sup-\nport the platform company’s growth. Platform companies \nthen became enabled.\nThree Theses\nRe:Build was organized around three theses—Advanced \nMaterials, Total Production Solutions (TPS), and Engineer-\ning Services.\nAdvanced Materials provided engineering, develop-\nment, prototyping, and production of advanced composite \nand metallic components for a wide range of applications \nand industries. Within Advanced Materials, the ETC-driven \ntechnology involved highly automated novel production \nprocesses for producing thermoplastic composites for stand-\nalone components or components integrated with thermosets \nand metals.\nTotal Production Solutions was the company’s inte-\ngrated offering of manufacturing, supply chain, and engi-\nneering design services. Arnone described TPS as end-to-end  \ncontract manufacturing engineering for customers and \nexplained a spate of demand:\nWe are being overrun by a tidal wave of companies that \nwant us to produce their products domestically, that \nwere being made offshore, to reshore them. This is very \nchallenging. The typical path for a company is you start \nby sending parts manufacturing offshore, but you keep \nassembly and engineering. Then over time you offshore \nthe assembly as well. Then during the next economic \ndownturn you may give up some of your engineering \ncapabilities. Before you know it, you have become a \nsales and marketing company. You start telling people \nhow wonderful it is because you are asset light, con-\ntrol the market, without all these costs of making stuff. \nThen you want a new product, you call your supplier \nup wherever they may be, China or somewhere else, \nand they tell you what the product is going to be.

As \nWilkie, Re:Build chair, explained,\nThere’s a lot of engineering that goes into the application \nof certain materials for certain parts, components and \nultimately finished goods…So we started with advanced \nmaterials in part because we think if we could demon-\nstrate great engineering work and great finished product \nwork in advanced materials, then we can start to build \naround it and build more and more complicated sub-as-\nsemblies and then people can ultimately locate in the US. \nYou’ll have people building finished goods factories right \nnext to those tiers of suppliers who can co-engineer with \nthem and start with the materials and basic assemblies \nthat are needed to assemble their final product.4\nGrowing Re:Build\nArnone and the Re:Build leadership team projected that \nRe:Build would have 12 companies in the fold—nine plat-\nform companies and three ETCs—by the end of the com-\npany’s fifth year in operation. After less than two years \noperating, Re:Build was ahead of schedule and poised to \nadd another company before the end of 2021. Leadership \nhad identified three companies as possible acquisition can-\ndidates (see Exhibit 9). Arnone said,\nAs we’ve progressed, we have been investing more heav-\nily in smaller-scale firms with ETC-like characteristics. \nThis has been caused by (a) a very overheated M&A mar-\nket, and (b) opportunistically our outreach to engineer-\ning services businesses has gone quite well…and we see \nthese companies as serving as ETCs but also a window \ninto many companies and industries that can inform \nour pursuit of platform companies going forward. As \nwe’ve built this ETC-centric group of companies, we are \nin a position heading into 2022 to now affect the acqui-\nsition of, and upgrading of, platform companies much \nmore so than we would have been had we bought an \nETC, then a platform, then another ETC, then maybe \ntwo platforms, etcetera.\nWhen considering an acquisition, leadership applied \na screening process to evaluate a platform company. The \nscreening process required a score of at least 70% for a can-\ndidate company to move to the next stage of due diligence. \nThere were three primary elements to the scoring:\nPotential improvements considered the strength of \nopportunities to improve performance by enhancing leader-\nship, transforming the current business model or pivoting to \ncapitalize on a market opportunity, ramping up sales, and/or \nrestructuring the sales function. A higher score indicated a \ngreater potential to make improvements to drive value.\nExisting characteristics considered the present strength \nof the company regarding market position, leadership, prod-\nuct offerings, and customer base. A higher score indicated a \nstronger characteristic.\nPlatform-specific characteristics considered the fit with \nthe Re:Build model and the Re:Build Way and looked at the \nsize and stage of the company being considered, its scalabil-\nity and potential to grow and/or contribute to the growth of \nthe Re:Build family of companies, and its company culture. \nSenior associate Chris Sachs (Darden MBA ’21) elaborated on \nidentified potential: “How will this company we are consider-\ning acquiring fit within the broader spectrum of the compa-\nnies we have amassed to date? Will it potentially deliver value \nto the other businesses under our umbrella? That’s ultimately \nour objective and that’s why it has a category weighting of \n10. The ability of all of our platform companies and ETCs to \ncollaborate with each other is really what separates Re:Build \nfrom being a private equity firm.” A higher score meant a \nstronger fit.\nExhibit 8 How ETCs Impact Platform Companies\nDarden Business Publishing cases are copyrighted by the University of Virginia Darden School Foundation, Charlottesville, VA.

Six months of looking at her colleagues in little boxes \non her computer screen had taken its toll, and while Jaseem \nappreciated the fact that this technology was available to keep \nUber Technologies, Inc.’s (Uber’s), managers and executives \nworking through the pandemic, the unusual circumstances \nof maintaining social distancing added another layer of dif-\nficulty to an already challenging situation. This morning’s \nmeeting had been particularly contentious. Jaseem, the prod-\nuct division’s senior program manager, had spent time with \nUber’s senior leadership team discussing the increasingly \nworrisome revenue forecast. \nUber ridership had dropped precipitously since the \nonset of the pandemic in March, and while other ride-hail-\ning companies were faring no better as October 2020 arrived, \nthe sector’s overall poor performance offered little comfort. \nPre-pandemic times had been tough enough—Uber had suf-\nfered a $8.5 billion loss in 2019, a post–initial public offering \n(IPO) depressed stock price, increasing competition, rising \npublic scrutiny of its rider safety protocols, and heightened \nregulatory pressure on the employment classification of driv-\ners, among other issues. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had pub-\nlicly rolled out a bullish vision for Uber’s profitable future, \nsuggesting that Uber would demonstrate profitable growth \nthrough “continuous innovation, excellent execution, and the \nunrivaled scale of our global platform.”2 His vision included \na commitment to a zero-emission fleet by 2040 and an antic-\nipation of social trends accelerated by the pandemic, with \ncities rethinking their infrastructure and individuals’ driv-\ning habits evolving.3 Yet the company had also just laid off \n6,700 employees—25% of its workforce—in May 2020,4 and \nKhosrowshahi himself had announced that he would forgo \nhis own base annual salary of $1 million.5 It was clear that the \nleadership team was under pressure to guide Uber boldly into \nthe future, but also that it needed to do so from a difficult \ncurrent financial position and under very challenging market \nconditions.\nJaseem had joined the company three years earlier, after \nspending several years at Google in a product-development \nleadership role, a job she secured immediately following \ngraduation from business school at the University of South-\nern California. A first-generation Iranian American, she had \ngrown up in Los Angeles after her parents immigrated to the \nUnited States in the mid-1990s. The car culture of Southern \nCalifornia had intrigued Jaseem as a young woman, later fuel-\ning her interest in issues around transportation and mobility, \nwhich had motivated her undergraduate major in Urban \nStudies at University of California–Irvine. Despite her inter-\nesting work at Google and a promising career track there, \nJaseem had jumped at the chance to join Uber in the fall of \n2017: it was an opportunity to continue to work in an exciting, \ntech-rich environment, at a firm poised for explosive growth, \nwhile also reconnecting to some of her core interests in urban \ndynamics and personal mobility. \nJaseem joined Uber at a key inflection point: the compa-\nny’s former CEO, Travis Kalanick, who personified the firm’s \n“bad boy” reputation, had stepped down the month before \nJaseem joined. His departure had given Jaseem confidence in \nUber’s changing culture, and she had hoped that her presence \nin a leadership position would help facilitate the move away \nfrom some of the company’s past internal problems, specifi-\ncally the reputed behind-the-scenes culture of misogyny and \ndiscrimination. True to Jaseem’s hopes, Uber’s culture had \nimproved under new CEO Khosrowshahi, but a host of other \ncontroversial concerns had arisen, challenging the relation-\nship between the company and its various stakeholders. The \nfirm’s recent continued financial volatility, from the high of \nits IPO to the low of the recent staggering net loss, didn’t ease \nmatters. A constant sense of urgency pervaded the company.\nKhosrowshahi had called a meeting for senior leaders \nthe next day, and Jaseem needed to prepare a list of potential \nstrategic action recommendations for the company to con-\nsider with an eye to better positioning itself to weather the \nuncertain times ahead. As the lead program manager of the \nproduct group, Jaseem would be presenting the group’s best \nideas to Uber’s full top management team, but she and her \nstaff had yet to settle on what those best ideas were. Jaseem \nknew it was going to be a long afternoon and evening, and \nshe sighed again as she thought about Uber’s past and con-\ntemplated its future.\nRevolutionizing Personal \nTransportation\nThe app-based ride-hailing company Uber helped spearhead \na revolution in personal transportation, massively disrupt-\ning the existing transportation-for-hire industry around the \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Harnessing the “sharing economy” zeitgeist in much \nthe same way that Airbnb had disrupted the hotel industry, \nUber created a digital platform that connected people seeking \nrides with freelance “gig economy” workers willing to pro-\nvide them. This offered the convenience of a smartphone app \n(as opposed to hoping a taxicab would physically drive by \nand hailing it by waving one’s arms) while also automating \nthe financial transaction itself, seamlessly collecting pay-\nment from the rider and paying the driver, all while earning \na margin for the company. (See Exhibit 1 for a visualization of \nhow the Uber app works.)\nDespite its meteoric rise and ubiquity, Uber confronted \na host of difficulties and challenges, both internal and exter-\nnal, in 2020. The company had grown wildly since its found-\ning in 2009, but had attracted controversy practically from \nits inception, making for a rocky decade-plus journey. Yet \nUber had experienced an extraordinarily rare level of rapid \nsuccess, not only growing exponentially, but also truly rev-\nolutionizing on-demand mobility throughout the world. So \ndeep was its impact on personal transportation, the com-\npany’s name had become a household word, a proprietary \neponym, a generic term for ride-hailing to a destination; “I’ll \nUber there” could mean one would take an Uber, a Lyft, or \nsome other means of catching a ride. Nevertheless, this mete-\noric success had not come without a cost; the company faced \na barrage of concerns from a variety of stakeholders. Driver \ndiscontent, regulatory pushback, globally uneven regulation \nand oversight, lawsuits about labor law violations from var-\nious states and cities, and scandal- and controversy-ridden \nleadership plagued Uber. On top of all that, after the compa-\nny’s IPO in May 2019, its stock price had faltered, and Uber \ncontinued to burn through cash. \nAs with many businesses and companies worldwide, \nthe COVID-19 viral pandemic only exacerbated Uber’s \noperational issues. Its 2020 Q1 bookings (1.6 billion), while \ndown from 2019 Q4 (1.9 billion), were still up from the \nsame quarter the previous year (1.5 billion in 2019 Q1); \nhowever, bookings from 2020 Q2—after COVID-19 lock-\ndowns had begun—had fallen precipitously, to 737 million. \nStarting in March 2020, when the virus began to aggres-\nsively spread throughout the globe, ridership had dwin-\ndled substantially, anywhere from 50% to 85% in major US \ncities. In the second quarter of 2020, revenues had fallen \n29% from the previous year, to $2.2 billion, a net quar-\nterly loss of $1.8 billion. The company’s Uber Eats deliv-\nery service, founded in 2015, was faring better, but overall, \nthe company was still, as one analyst put it, “swimming \nin the red ink”6 and struggling with an almost continuous \nstream of bad publicity from seemingly all angles. While \nthe replacement of controversial cofounder Kalanick had \ncalmed the public’s anti-Uber sentiment slightly, the com-\npany still contended with a number of objections and con-\ncerns from riders, drivers, privacy advocates, regulating \nmunicipalities, and employees.\nSource: Created by author and Eleanor Burton, Institute for Business in Society, University of Virginia Darden School of Business.

They ended up taking a limo, and \nCamp was shocked at the $800 cost of the ride. Back in San \nFrancisco, Camp, remembering that snowy Paris evening, \nthought more about founding a timeshare limo service order-\nable through an app, and bought the domain name UberCab.\ncom. His initial idea was born out of a question: What if you \ncould summon a ride using your mobile phone? The concept \nevolved over time as Camp refined the process of matching \nriders with drivers; users were able to get an estimated fare \nas well as an estimated arrival time for the driver (including \na map of the car’s location as it approached). Cash or credit \ncards were not needed at the point of transaction; post-ride, \nthe app would electronically apply the cost to a preset credit \ncard. All these features brought new convenience to people \nseeking rides, whether as a replacement for car ownership \nor to address an in-the-moment need. Uber simplified the \nprocess of arranging for a ride.\nCamp talked Kalanick, a UCLA dropout and founder \nof media search engine and file-sharing firms Scour and \nthen Red Swoosh—which Kalanick had sold for $19 million \nin 2007—into joining him as “Chief Incubator” at this new \nventure, which they called Uber Cab. Über meant above in \nGerman, and the word embodied an approach to the fledg-\nling company’s value proposition that Kalanick and Camp \nconsidered essential. In 2009, they developed a smartphone \napp that, with a tap of a button, summoned a ride. Uber \nCab, whose tagline was “Everyone’s Private Driver,” held a \nglitzy, invitation-only launch in San Francisco in June 2010 \nand incorporated as a business that July, but immediately \nreceived cease-and-desist orders from the San Francisco \nMunicipal Transportation Agency as well as the California \nPublic Utilities Commission. Despite the legal pushback \nUber received from the beginning, the company continued \noperating and growing, raising $1.25 million in venture fund-\ning in October 2010, with Shawn Fanning, former Napster \ncofounder, as one of the early investors. See Exhibit 2 for \nUber’s 14 Core Principles, written by Kalanick in 2010 as a \nguide for Uber’s strategy and culture.\nAlong with Kalanick, who became CEO in late 2010, \nsome of the other early hires at the company included “a \nnuclear physicist, a computational neuroscientist, and a \nmachinery expert who worked on predicting demand for \nprivate hire car drivers and where demand is highest.”7 In \nMay 2011, Uber rolled out in New York City, where it met \ngreat resistance from the taxicab industry. Nevertheless, \nUber continued to expand geographically, opening opera-\ntions in Paris, Chicago, Seattle, and Boston. Later that year, \nthanks to its growth and management’s promise of the tech-\nnology’s reach in other sectors, Uber completed a successful \n$37 million Series B round of fundraising. In February 2011, \n“Cab” was dropped from the company’s name, in part to \ndistance itself from the taxicab industry and to help position \nthe company to better avoid the industry’s accompanying \nregulations. The company was now Uber Technologies, Inc. \nIn August 2014, UberPool was introduced, allowing riders \nto “pool” their rides and share the cost. In April 2015, Uber \nEats launched in several large cities, including New York, \nChicago, and Los Angeles, and the food-delivery service was \nan immediate hit. In September 2017, Uber rides surpassed \ntaxi rides in New York City and, with the occasional fluc-\ntuation, continued that inverse trend through subsequent \nyears.8 (See Figure 1.)\nCustomer obsession (Start with what is best for the customer.)\nMake magic (Seek breakthroughs that will stand the test of time.)\nBig bold bets (Take risks and plant seeds that are five to ten years out.)\nInside out (Find the gap between popular perception and reality.)\nChampion’s mind-set (Put everything you have on the field to overcome adversity and get Uber over the finish line.)\nOptimistic leadership (Be inspiring.)\nSuperpumped (Ryan Graves’s original Twitter proclamation after Kalanick replaced him as CEO; the world is a puzzle to be \nsolved with enthusiasm.)\nBe an owner, not a renter (Revolutions are won by true believers.)\nMeritocracy and toe-stepping (The best idea always wins.

Many other global competitors had cropped up over \nthe years, including Ola in India, DiDi Chuxing in China, \nBolt (originally Taxify) in Europe, and Yandex Taxi—Uber’s \nown affiliate—in Russia and the former Soviet Republics. \nNevertheless, across all these markets, Uber maintained the  \nlargest—though less dominant—market leadership world-\nwide as well (see Figure 3).\nInternational Expansion\nBy late 2020, Uber operated in 85 different countries \naround the globe.11 However, the company’s international \nexpansion did not come easy; like its initial experience \nin San Francisco, Uber’s first international expansion, to \nFigure I NYC daily personal transportation trips, January 2016–June 2020.\nSource: Todd W.

The French protests would \ncontinue through the years, expanding into other areas \nof the country. It was not easy sailing anywhere on the \nglobe, it seemed. In June 2014, English taxi drivers staged \na protest against Uber in front of Buckingham Palace. \nThat same summer, German taxi drivers protested at the \nOlympic Stadium in Berlin. They cited unfair competition, \nflouting of rules, and aggressive competitive tactics such as \npoaching drivers and inundating other systems with false \nride requests. \nThe company’s subsequent expansion efforts followed \na rapid, locale-by-locale approach. Uber entered India and \nAfrica in 2013, although it was banned in the New Delhi \nregion after a passenger accused a driver of rape. There \nwere many successes as well as some big setbacks, such as \nin China, which initially showed great promise but where, \nafter establishing luxury car services in three of the big-\ngest cities in 2014, Uber faced competitive pressure from \nthe Chinese rival DiDi Chuxing. In order to operate there, \nUber had to pay large driver and rider subsidies, amount-\ning to an estimated $1  billion annually. Finally, in 2016, \nit pulled out of the country. And although it operated in \nHong Kong in “a legal gray area,”12 Uber persevered and \nmade plans to move its Asia Pacific headquarters there. \nUber operated briefly in Hungary, before mass protests \nand regulation forced the company to withdraw from the \ncountry for a time.\nUber also operated in Latin American countries, launch-\ning in Mexico in 2013; Colombia in 2013; Brazil, Peru, and \nChile in 2014; and Argentina in 2016. Its operations in these \ncountries were robust and profitable, but characterized by \ncontentiousness and at times violence. There was push-\nback from both the taxi industry and the government, with \nauthorities raiding Uber offices, destroying property, and \noften confiscating Uber cars in Argentina. In Mexico and \nBrazil, several Uber cars were torched and drivers attacked. \nUber also had to contend once again with competition from \nDiDi Chuxing in Latin America. Uber drivers in the region \nhad to learn some workaround techniques to avoid scru-\ntiny and pushback, including the following: “Uber offices \nchanging locations to avoid run-ins with governments, driv-\ners concocting background stories with passengers about \ntheir relationship in case they are pulled over or questioned, \ndrivers consistently insisting riders sit in the front passenger \nseat, drivers canceling trips in fear of taxis driving nearby, \nand drivers refusing to drive to the airport in fear of being \ndiscovered and fined.”13\nIn late 2019, the Transport for London (TfL) agency \nrevoked Uber’s license, though the company was allowed \nto continue operations while it appealed this revocation. \nIn September 2020, Uber won the appeal, with the judge \naffirming that the company “had taken the necessary steps \nto address regulators’ concerns, including new safety mea-\nsures to keep unauthorized and uninsured drivers from \nusing its platform to carry passengers.”14 Its license to operate \nin London, Uber’s biggest European market, was renewed \nfor another 18 months.\nCharting Uber’s Performance\nThrough all of these growing pains, both domestic and inter-\nnational, Uber’s rise had been truly remarkable (see Exhibit 3 \nto follow Uber’s valuation over the years). By August 2015, \nUber had achieved a $50 billion valuation, and that same \nyear, it more than doubled its number of active drivers from \n160,000 to 327,000.15 Uber celebrated its billionth trip on \nChristmas Eve, 2015, in London, with a five-British-pound \ntrip in a blue Honda Insight Hybrid.16 (Lyft hit the billion-ride \nmark in September 2018). The intensity of competition \nbetween Uber and Lyft was fierce, with Kalanick and Uber \nnot-so-stealthily trying to disrupt Lyft’s funding efforts—\nKalanick was upfront in a 2014 Vanity Fair interview about \ntrying to decrease rival Lyft’s capital options. Knowing that \nLyft was about to fundraise, Kalanick said Uber approached \nthese investors, telling them, “Just so you know, we’re going \nto be fund-raising after this, so before you decide whether \nyou want to invest in them, just make sure you know that we \nare going to be fund-raising immediately after.”17 Uber also \ntargeted Lyft drivers with some “dicey tactics,” such as “send-\ning so-called brand ambassadors to order Lyft rides under-\ncover and then persuade the drivers to defect to Uber.”18 Early \non, Uber also reduced its fares to compete with Lyft, which \ninfuriated many of its drivers, whose compensation was also \nreduced. \nUber sold equity shares to the public on the New York \nStock Exchange (NYSE) in May 2019, with an initial share \nprice of $45 and a $75.5 billion market capitalization. It was \nFigure 3 Global ride-hailing market share, 2018.\nSource: Automotive Connected Mobility Overview Fisita World Summit - November 2019. \nStrategy Analytics.

In addition to the \ndramatically increasing number of rideshare rides, Exhibit 4 \nshows a steady increase in the number of active users of the \nunderlying ridesharing apps, led by younger customers, as \nshown in Exhibit 5. \nBecause Uber’s post-IPO stock performance did not rise \nin proportion to the increasing demand for instant mobil-\nity among consumers, investors were disappointed.

These included “quiet mode,” which gave \nriders an in-app way to request minimal conversation,20 and \n“discreet reporting,” which allowed riders to bypass tradi-\ntional direct-to-driver feedback mechanisms to report some-\nthing that made them feel unsafe.21 In addition, the company \ndiversified into a number of different operations, branching \nout beyond its original core ride-for-hire smartphone applica-\ntion. “Everyone’s Private Driver” was retired as the company’s \ntagline, since Uber had begun to offer a variety of different \nservices, including modified ride-for-hire offerings such as \nUber Black (luxury vehicle hires in the spirit of Uber’s found-\ning idea), Uber Pool (carpool facilitation in a number of dif-\nferent urban markets), Uber Comfort (newer cars with extra \nlegroom), and Uber Green (sustainable rides in electric vehi-\ncles). But perhaps Uber’s most commonly recognized diver-\nsification was in the arena of food delivery, with its launch \nof Uber Eats in 2014. While Uber Eats certainly performed \nwell initially, it exploded in the COVID-19 era of lockdowns \nand social distancing. Notably, in the second quarter of \n2020, Uber Eats surpassed Uber’s core ridesharing business; \nfood delivery brought in revenue of $1.21 billion versus ride \nhailing at $790 million.22 As CEO Khosrowshahi put it, the \nfood-delivery business grew as big as the rides business had \nbeen when he joined the company: “We’ve essentially built a \nsecond Uber in three years.”23 \nThis business line promised significant growth potential. \nIn a call with investors in August 2020, Khosrowshahi sug-\ngested that opening up the delivery service to prescriptions, \nhome goods, and other consumer items presented additional \nopportunities for future revenue.

Uber Health launched \nin 2018, allowing health care facilities to arrange accessible \ntransportation solutions for patients. Other initiatives, such \nas Uber Rush (Uber’s attempt at on-demand urban cou-\nrier services), were launched unsuccessfully and then shut-\ntered. In 2015, to compete with Google’s autonomous vehicle \ndevelopment, the company founded Uber ATG (Advanced \nTechnologies Group), partnering with the National Robotics \nEngineering Center (NREC) at Carnegie Mellon University \nto develop its own technology, and later partnering with the \nUniversity of Toronto and receiving additional investment \nfrom Toyota and Softbank. Uber’s first self-driving car, a \nFord Fusion, was piloted in 2016 in Pittsburgh, after which \nthe company developed a fleet of Volvo self-driving cars, \nwith operations based in Arizona. The Uber Elevate busi-\nness unit included both the Uber Copter service between \nManhattan and JFK International Airport in greater New \nYork City, and the Uber Air initiative that envisioned a shared \nair-transportation ridesharing service at scale, with tentative \nplans to roll it out as soon as 2023. Uber Air identified initial \nlaunch markets of Dallas, Los Angeles, and Melbourne, and \ninvolved partnerships with original equipment manufacturer \n(OEM) aircraft manufacturers, skyport infrastructure part-\nnerships, and airspace management information systems.\nDriving for Uber\nIn its core business, the “gig” work that Uber provided was a \nhit with many drivers, who were unemployed, retired, look-\ning for occasional extra pocket money, or just supplementing \ntheir income. These individuals could work as their sched-\nules allowed, drove their own cars, and were responsible for \ntheir own insurance and vehicle maintenance.26 As indepen-\ndent contractors, they received no benefits such as overtime, \nunemployment insurance, or health coverage provided. \nDrivers could set their own schedules, choosing to work \nwhen they wanted. Just as riders could leave comments and \nratings for the driver on their app (along with any tip), driv-\ners could also rate their riders. Bad ratings for drivers could \naffect their number of trips and even get them dismissed; bad \nratings for passengers could mean they would have trouble \ngetting future rides. Payments to drivers were set up electron-\nically and flowed directly from the transactions with riders; \nUber kept 20% of the electronically collected fares, with the \nrest going to the driver. \nSince Uber’s inception, its drivers had been predomi-\nnantly male. In 2019, 59.1% of drivers were male and 40.9% \nwere female, roughly mirroring the gender makeup of Uber’s \nworldwide employees (see Exhibit 8). Among Uber’s drivers, \nstudies had shown a gender pay gap, with women drivers \nmaking approximately 7% less than men. This had noth-\ning discernible to do with Uber’s platform but potentially \nresulted from three primary factors: in general, men drove \nfaster (by about 2.2%), allowing them to give more rides; \nmale drivers were more comfortable going to riskier (and \ntherefore sometimes more remunerative) locations, while \nfemale drivers usually avoided riskier neighborhoods for \nsafety reasons; and men stayed on as Uber drivers longer \nthan women, gaining greater experience in efficient and \nmore lucrative driving strategies.27 In the United States, \nalmost 50% of drivers were white, followed by Asians, then \nAfrican Americans (see Exhibit 9).\nHow much a driver could earn working for Uber \ndepended on a number of factors, including the locale, the \ndriver’s experience, and the number and frequency of fares. \nAlthough Uber had once asserted, in 2014, that its drivers \ncould make up to $90,000 a year,28 this claim prompted a \n$20 million fine from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \nfor being fraudulently misleading.29 The reality was that, \nwhile the average driver’s hourly earnings before taxes had \nrisen to $19.73 by 2019,30 their after-expenses net earnings \nhovered between $8.55 and $11.77, making it a “photo finish \nwith fast food as the lowest-paid work in America.”31 Driver \nearning power also varied greatly between cities, with New \nYork City drivers averaging, before expenses, $29.34 per trip; \nFigure 6 Percentage of food-delivery sales, May 2020.\nSource: Willem Roper, “Uber to Acquire Postmates for $2.65 Billion,” July 7, 2020, https://\nwww.statista.com/chart/22206/uber-acquires-postmates/ (accessed Sept. 14, 2022).\nDoorDash, 45%\nGrubhub, 23%\nUber Eats, 22%\nPostmates, 8%\nOther, 2%\nData source: Uber Diversity and Inclusion Report, 2019, 9.\nExhibit 8 Worldwide Uber Employees by Gender\n0\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n2017\n2018\n2019\nMale\nFemale\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Indeed, Uber received \npressure not only to pay drivers better, but also to go further \nand classify them as employees; the public commotion over \ndriver exploitation had placed the company in the crosshairs \nof state and local government authorities.\nFor several years, many Uber drivers had protested \ntheir freelance-contract-worker status, seeking to become \nemployees who received benefits and perks. Uber (and Lyft, \nwhich experienced similar pressure) held firm against these \ndemands, but the outcry grew. In 2013, over 35,000 of the \ncompany’s independent drivers filed a class-action lawsuit \nseeking full employment along with better wages and ben-\nefits. Although the lawsuit was settled out of court in 2016, \nwith drivers still considered independent contractors, Uber \ndid take steps to improve both pay and perks. In August 2020, \nKhosrowshahi acknowledged the “existential question” that \nhad shadowed Uber for 10 years: “Do we treat drivers well?”33 \nCiting surveys indicating that most Uber drivers valued their \nflexibility over a more traditional safety net, as well as the \npotential far-reaching consequences for Uber of moving to a \nfull-time employee model—reduced service, employees, and \nefficiency—Khosrowshahi advocated for larger reforms to \nUS employment law to avoid the binary choice of flexibility \nversus security. Some experts disputed this characterization, \nsaying that being freelance worked for some of the drivers, \nbut not all; for instance, gig-economy expert and sociologist \nJuliet Schor pointed out that “people who are using these \nplatforms to supplement their income, rather than depending \non them for an income” fared much better than drivers whose \nlivelihood depended on driving for Uber.34\nIn the meantime, differential regulatory regimes had \nbegun to address the issue in distinct ways. For instance, \nCalifornia had passed a bill, State Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), in \nJanuary 2020. AB5 implemented a test to determine whether, \nunder California law, a worker was an employee. The law, \ndesigned to provide benefits to gig workers, would force the \nride-hailing companies to classify their drivers as employees \n“if it was shown that the drivers’ jobs were part of the compa-\nnies’ core business, among other criteria.”35 In response, Uber \nand Lyft, which continued to operate in California despite \nbeing sued by the state in May, argued that they were not \ntransportation companies, but merely tech platforms. At the \nsame time, both firms began to consider a franchise opera-\ntional structure, in which they would license their brands to \noperators of fleet vehicles, essentially creating independently \noperated franchises akin to a Federal Express model or Uber’s \noperations in Germany and Spain. A San Francisco judge \nruled in mid-August 2020 that the companies must imme-\ndiately reclassify their workers as employees; Uber and Lyft \nappealed, warning that they would have to cease operations \nin California if their appeal was unsuccessful.36 In late August, \nUber and Lyft pledged financial support to California ballot \ninitiative Proposition 22, which would exempt ridesharing \nand food-delivery companies from AB5 regulations, allow-\ning drivers to continue to set their own schedules. Although \nUber and Lyft suggested they would “offer a concession on \nminimum wage standards, health benefits and collective \nbargaining rights,”37 the issue continued to be contentious, \nwith one California assemblywoman, a sponsor of AB5, \nresponding that “billionaires who say they can’t pay mini-\nmum wages to their workers say they will spend tens of mil-\nlions to avoid labor laws. Just pay your damn workers!”38 \nThe campaign to promote Proposition 22 had, by September \n2020, cost gig-economy firms $181.4 million (paid by Uber, \nLyft, DoorDash, and Instacart), making it the costliest ballot \ninitiative in the state’s history). The legal wrangling contin-\nued, lending credence to Khosrowshahi’s assessment that the \ntreatment of drivers remained Uber’s existential issue.\nControversies and Challenges\nAs serious as the issue of driver treatment remained for Uber, \nit was far from the only friction point with the company’s \nstakeholders.

A number of particular challenges stood \nout in Jaseem’s mind.\nAggressive Market Entry and Operations\nEarly in its existence, Uber—which deliberately took a “don’t \nask for permission now; ask for forgiveness later” attitude in \nconducting business—found itself fighting different munici-\npalities and industry incumbents over the company’s legiti-\nmacy. At times, this involved a battle over public perception \nfor social acceptance, while at others, it involved the firm’s \nliteral license to operate (as in London or California), with \nassociated legal maneuvering. \nKalanick’s Brashness\nConsidered by some to be “arrogant and over-confident,” \nKalanick, who had already made millions with two different \nstart-ups before Uber, was a “renegade” with a brash, almost \nbelligerent personality, who made it impossible for Uber to \never “get out of public scorn.”39 In 2014, Kalanick caused a stir \nwhen, in a GQ interview, he called the company “Boober,” \nreferring to Uber’s popularity with women and claiming it \nhelped Kalanick attract “women on demand.”40 Several years \nlater, Kalanick faced backlash after a video of him arguing \nwith an Uber driver went viral.41 Kalanick later agreed that \nhe needed to “grow up,”42 although he countered all criticism \nwith remarks such as, “Look, I’m a passionate entrepreneur. \nI’m like fire and brimstone sometimes,” and “It’s hard to be a \ndisrupter and not be an asshole.”43 Although he stepped down \nas CEO in 2017, Kalanick remained on the Uber board until \nDecember 2019, and in many ways, the company continued \nto grapple with the early image Kalanick had set.\nPrivacy Concerns\nEarly on, at several of its launch parties in various cities, Uber \nunveiled what it called its “God View” tool, which allowed \nmanagers at the company to see all the Uber users in the area \nin real time. Usually this was anonymous—waiting riders \nwere not identified, simply visible in shadow. However, in \nsome instances, riders were identifiable, leading to broad \nconcern and outcry over rider privacy, causing some custom-\ners to quit the service altogether. Some called it the “Creepy \nStalker View.”44 In any case, the publicity of Uber’s casual \napproach to privacy, with God View and other missteps, trig-\ngered a larger public conversation about the service’s privacy \npractices and lack of vigilance. \nSurge Pricing \nDuring times of peak ridership, such as rush hour and hol-\nidays like New Year’s Eve and Halloween, algorithm-deter-\nmined fares spiked higher in what was called surge pricing. \nThis pricing produced predictable complaints from custom-\ners, as fares could increase dramatically over the normal rate. \nUber first came under scrutiny for surge pricing during New \nYear’s Eve 2012 in New York City, when fares shot up as much \nas eight times the normal rates; later, in 2016, there was a \nclass-action suit against the company, alleging that Uber’s \nsurge pricing had violated antitrust laws against price fixing. \nUber’s troubles deepened in July of that year when “a fed-\neral judge ruled that Uber ‘engaged in fraudulent and argu-\nably criminal conduct’ when it used an investigative firm \nto conduct a background check” on the plaintiff who filed \nthe original lawsuit.45 In January 2017, after a federal execu-\ntive order was signed banning travelers from several Muslim \ncountries from entering the United States, protests were held \nat JFK International Airport. In support of the protest, taxis \navoided the area, but Uber stepped into controversy by con-\ntinuing to serve the area and even eliminated surge pricing \nthere, a move that was interpreted by many as seeking to \nboost its business by taking advantage of the lack of taxis and \nthe tumultuous situation. As a result, the hashtag “Delete \nUber” went viral.46 \nSafe-Ride Fees\nIn April 2014, a $1.00 surcharge was added to each fare, \nallegedly to help cover benefits for drivers by funding “an \nindustry-leading background check process, regular motor \nvehicle checks, driver safety education, development of safety \nfeatures in the app, and insurance.”47 That turned out not to \nbe the case. Employees who worked on the fee program later \ntold an investigative reporter that the dollar per ride was pure \nprofit for the company, bringing in over half a billion dol-\nlars over time—money that was never earmarked for safety \nimprovement. Yet Uber used the fee to promote its service as \nthe “safest.” A class-action suit followed, and Uber was forced \nto pay $30 million—a small fraction, as the New York Times \ninvestigative report stated, of the “safe-ride fees” it had col-\nlected over the years. \nData Security\nIn 2016, in a second breach of data (following a previous \none that had occurred in 2014), hackers were able to clan-\ndestinely access Uber’s user data, stealing users’ personal \ninformation and demanding money. As it was later revealed, \nthen–Uber Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan quietly worked \nwith management to pay the hackers $100,000 as long as they \nsigned a nondisclosure agreement. The 2014 hack had con-\ncerned Uber’s leaders; the second hack horrified them, and \nSullivan and others were determined that knowledge of the \ndata breaches would not become public. Sullivan kept the \ninformation from both the FTC—which was investigating \nthe earlier hack—and Uber employees, who were already \nworking with the FTC on the earlier hack. The data breach \nwas not disclosed until 2017, when Kalanick stepped down \nand Khosrowshahi became CEO. When he learned what had  \nhappened, Khosrowshahi fired Sullivan along with other \nUber employees who had helped in the cover-up. Uber \npaid $148 million to settle with state attorneys general who \nhad sued the company, as well as $1.2 million to British and \nDutch regulators. In August 2020, Sullivan was charged with \nattempting to hide the hack from the FTC investigators.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

A former company engineer, Susan \nFowler, wrote a damning blog post about her experiences \nwith Uber’s sexist workplace culture.48 In addition, that \nsame month, there was a blistering New York Times report \nabout Uber’s “Hobbesian environment…in which workers \nare sometimes pitted against one another and where a blind \neye is turned to infractions from top performers.”49 Alleged \nbehavior included groping women, going after an employee \nwith a baseball bat, unrestrained cocaine use, and use of \nhomophobic slurs. Management responded by launching \na high-profile independent inquiry to investigate the com-\nplaints about misogyny and recklessness in the work envi-\nronment. The investigation confirmed Fowler’s accounts, \ncorroborating the ubiquitous sexism embedded in the com-\npany, and also documented a number of other aspects of the \nfirm’s “bad boy” internal culture. This eventually led not only \nto Kalanick’s resignation as CEO, but also to the departure \nof 20 employees and new rules about workplace behavior.50 \nIn an attempt to alleviate the discord, Khosrowshahi, in \nNovember of that year, posted a new list of Uber’s cultural \nnorms, which included, among other things, “We do the right \nthing. Period.”51 See Exhibit 10 for Khosrowshahi’s rewritten \nlist, which dropped some of Kalanick’s original values such as \n“Superpumped” and “Always be hustlin’.”\nSexual Assaults While Riding\nIn December 2019, Uber voluntarily released a report stating \nthat it had received almost 6,000 reports of sexual assault in \nthe United States in the previous two years. Roughly half the \nassaults had been committed by drivers and the other half \nby passengers. Uber said it released the report in the inter-\nest of “improving safety for Uber and the entire industry.”52 \nLyft had its own issues with sexual assault reports, though \nthey appeared to be far fewer. While there was no publicly \navailable data, a CNN investigation determined that, between \n2014 and 2018, 18 Lyft drivers (compared to 103 Uber drivers) \nhad been accused of sexually assaulting passengers.53 This \nissue raised concerns about safety among potential passen-\ngers, particularly women, and caused some female riders to \navoid Uber in favor of Lyft.\nTheft of Autonomous Vehicle Technology\nIn 2017, mere months after partnering with NREC at Carnegie \nMellon University to develop self-driving technology, Uber—\npromising triple salaries and increased benefits—hired over \n65 NREC engineers away to develop its own technology, \nlocated in a new 53,000-foot research center not even a mile \naway from NREC. This almost caused the well-regarded \nNREC to shut down. Two years later, Uber moved its auton-\nomous vehicle division to the Vector Institute for Artificial \nIntelligence at the University of Toronto. In 2017, Waymo, an \nautonomous vehicle division spun off by Alphabet (Google), \naccused Uber of stealing some of its technology. A former \nWaymo engineer, Anthony Levandowski, was accused of \ndownloading confidential files before leaving Waymo and \nstarting a company that Uber planned to acquire. This turned \ninto a multiyear legal battle, with Uber settling with Waymo \nin February 2018 and warning investors that it might have to \npay Waymo to use the technology involving the laser naviga-\ntional tool Lidar. Levandowski pleaded guilty in the spring of \n2020, facing 30 years in prison.\nWe build globally, we live locally.

Data collected from the app allowed \nthe company, with approval from its legal team, to identify and \nrefuse rides to authorities trying to enforce local regulations \non the company. This software had been used in cities such \nas Boston and Las Vegas, as well as in other countries. Under-\ncover authorities would try to hail a ride using what they did \nnot realize was a fake app that showed nonexistent Uber cars \nin the area. Alerted to these authorities by their apps, drivers \ncould then cancel the rides—a practice that became known \nas Greyballing the authorities. The use of Greyball attracted a \ncriminal probe from the US Department of Justice.\nCongestion and Efficiency\nPart of ride-hailing companies’ value proposition was the \nreduction of congestion and air pollution in cities achieved by \ngetting cars off the road, decreasing time spent in traffic, and \noffering faster, more economical rides. However, the reality \nwas much more complicated. A 2018 government study con-\ncluded that “those convenient rides really are not so conve-\nnient after all when accounting for the extra time commuters \nwere spending in traffic. The authors of the survey crunched \nthe numbers and found that ride-sharing companies…were \naccountable for a 51% increase in commuters’ time in 2016 \nwhen compared to 2010.”54 That same year, a different report \nfrom a New York–based consulting company revealed that \nmass transit was being hurt by the ride-hailing companies, with \nmany people opting to take the quicker, albeit more expen-\nsive, alternative. Furthermore, the report also outlined how \n“deadheading”—the term for Uber and Lyft drivers spending \npassenger-less time on the road while waiting for calls on their \napp—was actually putting more cars on the road, not fewer.55 \nIn addition, certain neighborhoods and intersections tended \nto attract rideshare drivers awaiting new customers, imposing \nintangible costs associated with increased traffic and pollution \non local residents that neither drivers, nor oblivious riders, \nnor the company itself ever had to bear. \nAutonomous Vehicle Death\nIn March 2018, a driver in one of Uber’s autonomous vehi-\ncles struck and killed a pedestrian who was walking her bike \nacross a street in Tempe, Arizona. The first incidence of a \npedestrian death caused by an autonomous vehicle, it raised \nthe thorny ethical issue of who held responsibility for fatal-\nities such as these. There were few laws of any type govern-\ning the liability for autonomous vehicle–involved accidents; \nwhile the National Transportation Safety Board attributed the \ncrash primarily to human error, it also pinpointed what it \ncalled Uber’s “inadequate safety culture.”56 Uber temporarily \nsuspended its self-driving-car tests, although the company \nresumed operations the following year, with added restric-\ntions including required lower speeds. Two years later, in \nSeptember 2020, the driver was charged with negligent \nvehicular homicide; she had been watching a video right \nbefore the accident and had not braked until it was too late.\nRacial Issues \nIn the summer of 2020, after the killing of George Floyd by a \npolice officer ignited widespread protests and calls for police \nreform and racial justice globally, Uber attempted to address \nthe issue of racial inequality, outlining a series of initiatives and \nactions. These initiatives included the company committing to \nanti-racism education for drivers and riders alike, expanding \ninternships and opportunities for people of color, and dou-\nbling the number of Black leaders employed at the company \nby 2025. Additionally, Uber put up billboards reading, “If you \ntolerate racism, delete Uber”; however, this awareness cam-\npaign engendered some public backlash. Whereas the mes-\nsage was meant to show company support for racial-justice \nefforts, critics described such public displays as hypocritical. \nBecause California’s Proposition 22 was viewed as harmful to \ndrivers—many of whom were members of minority groups—\nwho depended on ridesharing as their sole livelihood, Uber’s \npublic support of racial justice while simultaneously funding \nthe California Proposition 22 campaign was seen as disingen-\nuous. Other critics pointed out that both Uber and Lyft had \nbeen accused of price discrimination in predominantly non-\nwhite communities, adding to the controversy.57\nMoving Forward in a COVID-19 World\nAs the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic unfolded and progressed, \nUber, like many other companies, was hit hard financially (see \nExhibit 11). Not only had Uber’s loss of revenue deepened the \nimpact of the company’s various existing challenges by lowering \ndemand for ridesharing, but it had also created a new problem: \nhow to recover lost ridership in the face of individuals actively \nminimizing their own travel to avoid exposure to the deadly \ndisease. The travel industry in general had been harmed by a \ncollective fear of infection; in the face of second-quarter 2020 \nlosses, airlines “parked 16,000 airliners” as “passenger volume \ndropped 90%,” hotel occupancy hit an all-time record low, \nand business travel was projected to drop over 35% by the end \nof 2020.58 In September 2020, as part of an effort to reassure \npotential customers regarding infectious disease precautions, \nUber embedded a mask-verification protocol into its core app, \nrequiring drivers to submit photos with masks in place and \nasking riders to verify mask wearing as well.\nBut Jaseem worried that these efforts might make little \ndifference. A recent automotive industry survey revealed \nthat 39% of Americans who previously relied on rideshar-\ning planned to decrease or cease their use of those services \naltogether, even after economic activity returned to normal, \nand 49% planned to increase usage of their own personal \nvehicle.59 Much as experts were suggesting that the collec-\ntive shift toward working from home during the pandemic \nmight have lasting effects on the commercial real estate \nindustry even after the pandemic ended, Jaseem wondered \nwhat the lasting effects of 2020’s massive dip in ridesharing \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

It painted an \nunsettling portrait, even before the effects of COVID-19. The \ncompany, the report read, had incurred “significant losses \nsince inception.” Operating losses for the past several years \nwere: $4.1 billion (2017); $3.0 billion (2018); and $8.6 billion \n(2019). At the end of 2019, the company had an accumulated \ndeficit of $16.4 billion.60 The way she saw it, the company \nwas facing a triple whammy: challenging financials, various \npersistent stakeholder frictions, and the unpredictable effects \nof the significant current global health crisis.\nWhat strategic choices should Uber make?

The \nturnaround had been nothing short of miraculous, leading \nFast Company to recognize The Post as one of the “World’s \nMost Innovative Companies” … “for bringing Amazonian \nambition to news.”2\nYet, despite all its success, The Post continued to face \nseveral significant business challenges, including new \ncompetitors, a growing number of channels through which \nreaders consumed news, and rapidly changing consumer \nbehavior. While The Post was transforming itself, the share \nof Americans using social media to access news had nearly \ndoubled to 48%. Underscoring this trend, Gen Z indi-\nviduals (those born after 1996) were far more likely than \nthose in earlier generations to use social media and news \naggregators instead of direct methods (e.g., https://www \n.washingtonpost.com/) to access news, hurting both sub-\nscriptions and ad revenues, and posing challenges to the \nfuture profitability of The Post.\nOn August 4, 2021, The Post announced the creation \nof Next Generation (Next Gen)—a new initiative to accel-\nerate the acquisition of younger and more diverse audi-\nences through new products, practices, and partnerships.3 \nAs part of the announcement, Ryan made the following \nstatement:\nOver the past few years, The Post has boldly experimented \nin developing new ways to reach readers and expand our \nsubscription base. We have delivered The Washington Post \njournalism to the broadest national and global audience \nin our history with many younger readers enjoying Post \ncontent on sites and in formats that didn’t exist a few \nyears ago, and we are eager to build upon this success \nand accelerate our progress.\nTo execute the Next Gen initiative, a cross-company task \nforce was formed to develop The Post’s strategic roadmap \nfor emerging audiences, which it would present to Ryan and \nhis executive team. The future of the 143-year-old institution \nwould depend on its ability to continue its organizational \ntransformation and innovate for the next generation.\nA Brief History of the American \nNewspaper Industry and  \nThe Washington Post\nThe first newspapers in the newly formed United States had \nbeen crucial to inspiring civic unrest across the Thirteen Col-\nonies by spreading radical ideas on personal liberties. Their \nvast influence during the Revolutionary Period was plainly \nunderstood by the authors of the US Constitution when \nthey designed the First Amendment to cement the role of \nnewspapers as a bulwark of democracy, capable of holding \nthe powerful to account. Historian and Continental Congress \ndelegate David Ramsay observed, “In establishing American \nindependence, the pen and the press had merit equal to that \nof the sword.”4\nDespite the legal protections of the First Amendment, \nnewspapers of the late 18th century struggled with a busi-\nness model based on feeble circulation capacities (only sev-\neral hundred readers per paper), content lag times ranging \nfrom weeks to months, and particularly high operating costs.5 \nOn the demand side, low literacy rates, a largely nonexistent \nmiddle class, and a highly rural agrarian society constrained \nexpansion. These business pressures would linger for nearly a \ncentury before giving way to a period of enormous growth in \nthe late 1800s for the newspaper industry6 (Exhibit 1).\nDuring this period of growth, Stilson Hutchins, founder \nof the Saint Louis Times, moved to Washington, DC, and \nbegan publishing at 914 Pennsylvania Avenue under the title \nof The Washington Post on Thursday, December 6, 1877.7 The \nfirst published papers focused chiefly on government affairs \nand were circulated to around 10,000 readers, mainly resi-\ndents of Washington, DC.\nIn the late 19th century, American newspapers, including \nThe Post, continued to be constrained by two stubbornly high \ncosts—printing and circulation (transportation). Several \nadvancements during the era improved the viability of papers \nin less populated and more competitive environments: the \ntelegraph (which decreased story lead times), railroad net-\nworks (which enabled wider circulation), and the Linotype \nprinter (which decreased printing costs). Created by German \nimmigrant Ottmar Mergenthaler in Baltimore, Maryland, the \nLinotype printer was said to have been described by Thomas \nEdison as the Eighth Wonder of the World.8 When Mergen-\nthaler unveiled his new machine in January 1883, Hutchins \nwas an eager spectator. Of the first 102 machines produced \nThis field-based case was prepared by Ryan Nelson, Professor of Commerce, and Kevin Miner, Research Assistant.

The Linotype \nallowed The Post to swell production and develop longer and \nmore complex segments (the first newspapers printed at The \nPost were limited to just four pages due to high costs). Aided \nby rising demand and technical innovation, many publishers \nreorganized themselves to focus on large commercial adver-\ntising deals and mass subscription revenues. \nAfter The Post was hit hard by both scandal9 and the \nGreat Depression, Eugene Meyer bought the organization at a \npublic bankruptcy auction for $825,000 in 1933. He returned \nThe Post to financial stability and greatly improved its repu-\ntation among Washingtonians. Meyer gave the paper to his \nson-in-law, Philip Graham, who led the paper from 1946 \nto 1963. Upon his death, Katharine Meyer Graham became \nthe first 20th century female publisher of a major American \nnewspaper. She would inspire a new generation of journalism \ndedicated to truth and courage above all else. Despite per-\nsonal threats from the White House, she oversaw The Post’s \ncommitment to uncovering the secrets of the Watergate scan-\ndal, leading to President Richard Nixon’s resignation, and also \noversaw the publishing of the Pentagon Papers, which contrib-\nuted to the end of the Vietnam War. In 1979, Katharine Meyer \nGraham passed the paper over to her son, Donald. Donald \nGraham led The Post for nearly three decades before hand-\ning the CEO and publisher titles over to his niece, Katharine \nWeymouth, in 2008. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos would buy \nThe Post five years later, in 2013. As a clear representation of \nits mission and a historical connection to the first American \nnewspapers, “Democracy Dies in Darkness” became the first \nofficial slogan of The Post in 2017, and appeared at the end of \nits first Super Bowl commercial in 2019. \nThe Washington Post’s Digital \nTransformation Journey\nFor over a century, The Post was well positioned in the profit-\nable Washington, DC, metro area; it held a dominant share of \nthe market, produced unique content for devoted subscrib-\ners, and was financially supported by a robust combination \nof local advertising and subscription revenues. As a watchdog \nin the federal government’s own backyard, The Post earned \na reputation for hard-hitting investigative journalism that \nextended its brand around the world. \nUnfortunately, industry disruption caused by the inter-\nnet and the 2008 financial crisis proved disastrous for news-\npapers. After The Washington Post Company had faced six \nstraight years of declining revenue,10 Katharine Weymouth \nand Donald Graham made the difficult decision to person-\nally approach Bezos and ask that he lead The Post into the \ndigital age. Despite his initial reservations, Bezos agreed to \nbuy The Post for $250 million, ending four generations of \nGraham family ownership and 42 years of public trading. In \nthe deal, Nash Holdings LLC, Bezos’s personal holding com-\npany, bought The Post as well as some related ventures.11 Many \nindustry analysts at the time believed that there were no easy \nfixes Bezos could use to return The Post to profitability.12\nData sources: Dailies, 1790–1925: William A.

Following his service as chief of staff to Pres-\nident Ronald Reagan, Ryan had served as vice-chair of the \ntelevision, cable, and internet company Allbritton Communi-\ncations. While at Allbritton, Ryan cofounded Politico, a polit-\nically focused website and newspaper. Ryan reflected on his \nfirst meeting with Bezos:\nIn the very first meeting we had when we were talking \nabout this job, I asked him, “Jeff, why did you buy The \nWashington Post?” He said, “I bought The Washington Post \nbecause I believe that a free, independent, and strong press \nis essential for the health of our democracy.” And I thought, \nthat’s the right answer…the answer I was hoping for.13\nSoon after joining The Post, Ryan worked with his exec-\nutive team (Exhibit 2) to reinvent the organization’s business \nand operating model to become much nimbler and risk tol-\nerant. Ryan characterized it this way: “The Post, like many \nlarge, successful institutions, can become the proverbial bat-\ntleship that is very slow to turn.” Recognizing the role that \nculture played in organizational change, The Post redefined \nhow employees were reviewed, placing an emphasis on three \ncriteria, called catalysts, to convey that “something is hap-\npening”: shaping ideas, taking ownership, and speed of exe-\ncution. Ryan described the importance of the three catalysts: \nWe continue to ensure that our speed of execution \nbecomes an asset for us rather than a liability. When there \nis a competitive environment, we want to be able to exe-\ncute faster than our competitors, so that we can do the \ndeal, launch the product, and be the first.\nIt was clear that the three catalysts were designed to \ncreate an organizational culture that would help turn the \nSource: Created by authors.

Lever-\naging the three catalysts, several strategic initiatives helped \nsteer the “battleship” in a new direction: developing a digital- \nproduct mindset, rebuilding the newsroom, redesigning core \nbusiness processes, and achieving excellence in both technol-\nogy and journalism.\nDeveloping a Digital-Product Mindset\nPrior to joining The Post, Ryan and Bezos had seen firsthand \nwhat a digital-product mindset could do to make an organi-\nzation nimbler, more innovative, and ultimately more com-\npetitive. Ryan described the early work this way:\nIt was important that we quickly build a digital mindset \nacross the organization, particularly in the newsroom, \nwhere page A1 of the newspaper had traditionally been \nconsidered the most important item we produced. We \nwere able to accelerate our growth by staying focused on \nour digital product and the ways we could extend the \nreach our journalism.\nFortunately, when they got to The Post, Ryan and Bezos \ndiscovered that Shailesh Prakash, The Post’s chief information \nofficer (CIO), had created a solid foundation on which to build \ndigital products. Before joining The Post in 2011, Prakash had \nheld engineering leadership roles at Motorola, Sun Microsys-\ntems, Netscape, and Microsoft, and was responsible for prod-\nuct development and engineering for e-commerce operations \nat Sears. Prakash recalled his first days at The Post:\nThere was a lot that needed fixing. Product development \nhad slowed to almost a standstill and the newsroom had \nvery little confidence in the systems they used to do their \njobs and in IT’s ability to ship digital products. I needed \nto roll up my sleeves and get into the trenches, and that \nis what I focused on initially. I also needed to move the \norganization from an IT mindset of babysitting systems \ninto a product development mindset of building and \ninventing digital products.\nEarly on, Prakash encountered different levels of accep-\ntance for his initiatives, with the organization falling into \nthree groups: one group embraced the changes, saying “This \nis exactly what we need! We will finally make some prog-\nress”; another group that was very resistant, saying “Oh my \nGod, this guy is going to tank the ship”; and “the big middle,” \nwhose members simply watched and waited to see what \nwould happen. With top management’s support, Prakash \nbrought in new engineering talent and got some early wins \non the board to help convince “the big middle” that The Post \nwas headed in the right direction. \nIn the new model, engineers were empowered to be more \nhands-on, co-located to work directly with their internal \npartners in the newsroom and build, rather than buy, digital \nsolutions. They were also expected to ship quickly and ship \noften. Kat Downs Mulder, managing editor for digital (and \nformerly head of product), described the changes this way: \n“I think it was good for us because we just so badly needed a \nmetabolism shift toward more creation, more invention, and \nmore embracing of new ideas and new technology.”\nOne pivotal moment came during a change-requirement \nmeeting when the project-management group presented a \ncomprehensive spreadsheet with red, yellow, and green used \nto represent the status of stakeholder requests. At the end \nof the one-hour meeting with more than 60 participants, it \nwas still not clear what was needed. After months of debate, \nit turned out that the changes that the newsroom wanted \ncould be achieved with minimal engineering effort. Prakash \ndescribed “a revelation in terms of how much the bureaucracy \nof constant debate had stifled both stakeholders and product \ndevelopers.” Regarding the massive spreadsheet for tracking \nrequirements, he smiled and said, “It’s great for status reports, \nbut it’s not good for productivity.” Mulder agreed:\nWhat doesn’t work is just having people execute on an \nassembly line. You need the team to be engaged with for-\nmulating the roadmap and prioritizing things; otherwise, \nyou just end up doing the stuff on a list. It’s outcomes, \nnot outputs.\nPrakash was adamant that this was the best way to work:\nEvery day of the week, and twice on Sunday, I’d prefer a \nmodel where the engineers are directly engaged with their \nnewsroom partners rather than having a layer of project \nmanagers in the middle who kind of, sort of think they \nknow what’s going on, while the actual doers are twid-\ndling their thumbs saying, “I’m sorry, what am I supposed \nto do again? I’m waiting for the order. What should I do?”\nTo help put the product-development mindset into action, \nThe Post adopted agile methodologies and scrum practices. \nThe result was that teams (“squads”) worked together more \nefficiently on the things that mattered. Over time, roughly \na dozen different product teams were formed, each consist-\ning of 5 to 10 members with the following roles: lead prod-\nuct manager, one or more designers (user experience [UX] \ndesigner, visual designer, or design technologist), one or more \nengineers (front end, back end, or hybrid), a scrum master \n(typically shared across multiple teams), and subject-matter \nexperts as appropriate (e.g., analytics or A/B testing). Mulder \nadded: “One of our goals is to give them more autonomy and \ngive them more power to experiment.” \nAt an organizational level, there were two main compo-\nnents to the product group: one focused on reader revenue \n(including purchasing a subscription, managing all the pay-\nwalls and registration, subscriber engagement, and reten-\ntion), and one focused on the core user experience (including \nall manifestations of journalism on every platform, as well as \nthe features that made it easy for readers to find what they \nwere interested in consuming). Seamless product integration \ndemanded that the two units worked closely together and \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.\n\nC-220\nPart 4: Case Studies\nquarterly alignment exercises were used to review the prod-\nuct organization’s objectives and key results (OKRs). \nProduct vision was communicated from the top using a \nvision statement containing high-level objectives and how \nthey would be measured (key results). Each product team \nwould then set out to execute those objectives by drafting \nOKRs for the team, which were then reviewed for align-\nment with the company vision every two weeks. Periodically, \nmulti-team communication meetings were held to track \nprogress against objectives and get visibility into what the \nproduct organization was doing. In addition, product road-\nmap reviews occurred once a month with the executive team. \nMulder explained:\nThe tricky part is that you really want empowered teams, \nbut there are higher-level business and financial decisions \nthat depend on what the product teams are doing…and \nso there are moments in which it has to be escalated a \nlevel, and so forth…I do think that it’s really important \nto facilitate prioritization in order for people to have a \nreally clear understanding of why you’re choosing to do \ncertain things.\nAlthough he didn’t get involved in editorial content or the \nday-to-day business at The Post, every two weeks, Bezos met \nvia phone with the leadership team to review process, prod-\nuct, and technical issues, such as subscription flow and load \ntime for the website. Prakash highlighted some of the benefits \nof having Bezos as the owner of The Post:\nHere’s a man who understands and believes in product \ndevelopment. He’s always encouraged us to innovate and \ninvent and not worry too much about having the full \nbusiness plan figured out before we start building. He \nwants to see us constantly make our site faster, lower the \ncognitive dissonance of the news-reading experience…\nyou name it, and Jeff pushes on it, and he’s excited about \nit. My developers talk to him, my product managers talk \nto him, and my designers talk to him. We love the fact \nthat he is a product guy.\nThe frequent engagement with Bezos also proved to be \ninstrumental in recruiting and retaining hundreds of top \ntechnologists—many of whom would have otherwise taken \njobs with technology companies like Facebook, Google, and \nMicrosoft. Utilizing this talent, The Post released a variety  \nof industry-leading products in the years leading up to 2021 \n(see representative examples in Exhibit 3).\nRebuilding the Newsroom\nStaying above water during the downturn had required \naggressive cost cutting that reduced newsroom staff by a \nthird in the decade preceding 2012.14 Ryan and his team had \nbeen determined to rebuild what was core to the business—\nthe newsroom. To this end, they provided the tools and \nresources necessary for the news creators to grow with the \nrest of the business. As a point of reference for the speed \nwith which The Post had hired, when Bezos bought The Post \nin 2013, the newsroom had 580 employees. In 2021, The Post \nwas on track to add 150 new positions, which would expand \nthe newsroom to 1,010 employees—the largest newsroom in \nthe history of The Post. Many of these new roles emphasized \na forward-looking approach to covering the news. Data sci-\nentists, graphic and data designers, and software engineers \naided The Post in using data visualizations to communi-\ncate complex topics in simple and powerful ways. Ryan \nexplained:\nThe Post’s newsroom had been cut so deep before its sale \nthat it had made a significant impact on the company’s \nability to attract readers and advertisers alike. It was a top \npriority to me to rebuild our core reporting centers like \npolitics, national security, foreign policy, and investiga-\ntive, and expand into areas like technology, climate, food, \nand travel. That strategy was proven to be the right one, \nwith meteoric subscription growth and record advertis-\ning revenue.\nThe added human capital also supported The Post’s polit-\nical journalism. The largest political news team ever assem-\nbled at The Post comprised additional journalists, engineers, \nand data scientists. The diverse team developed one-of-a-\nkind data visualizations and political models widely adopted \nby eager readers (e.g., complex voting models were success-\nfully deployed during the 2020 US presidential election to \nmuch fanfare).\nUtilizing the larger, modernized workforce, The Post \nwidened its news content by adding new channels of con-\ntent dissemination. To capitalize on a growing domestic \ninterest in foreign affairs and capture digital audiences \nabroad, The Post invested in expanding its world content \nby adding foreign staff in 26 locations—the largest corps of \nforeign correspondents in The Post’s history. To approach \nnew customers, The Post powered its apps with augmented- \nreality storytelling features and invested in audio story-\ntelling and live news events, constructing three studios to  \nair The Post journalists on channels like the Cable News \nNetwork (CNN) and MSNBC as well as produce original \nvideo content.\nRedesigning Core Business Processes\nThere were two principal ways to monetize news, regardless \nof whether it was digital or printed: advertising and sub-\nscriptions. For most of The Post’s history and that of its com-\npetitors, advertising had played the leading role in the form \nof a multisided platform business model—bringing together \ntheir two distinct but interdependent groups of customers: \nadvertisers and subscribers.15 Yet, more recently, the internet \nput pressure on advertising revenues (Exhibit 4) because ad \nspace became ubiquitous online (Exhibit 5). The extreme \ndecline in print advertising happened without an equally \noffsetting rise in digital advertising for many companies, \nunderscoring a grim industry situation.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The team developed several revenue- \ngenerating products including Feed Builder, which scanned \nall available personal content information and then used \nproprietary personalization technology to align ads with \nwhat users were currently reading or viewing on the site. \nThe tool was developed with thorough subscriber testing \nand feedback. The Post’s goal was to bring the most rele-\nvant ads to subscribers while boosting ad engagement for \nits partners.\nThe Post’s approach to digital subscriptions evolved \nthrough a process of experiment-test-learn-adapt. Like \nother newspapers, The Post had entered the digital world \nwith free content underwritten by print subscriptions and \nadvertising. Paywalls emerged when that model failed \n(Exhibit 6). First, The Post had a 20-story paywall, then \nit reduced the limit to 10 stories, and then 5. Later, with \nthe help of technology, The Post transitioned to dynamic \npaywalls.

Making something that someone sees \nvalue in, and then you have to get the price right, and that’s \nsomething we are constantly experimenting with.”\nAs a positive sign that its experiments were leading \nThe Post in the right direction, the organization recorded \n111.6 million unique visitors to its website in January 2021 \n(3 million more than the New York Times for the same \nmonth) (Exhibit 7). Later that year, The Post reported the \nsecond-highest number of paying digital news subscribers in \nthe world, at 3 million (Exhibit 8). \nThe Post credited much of this incredible success to a \nunique partnership between its engineering and market-\ning personnel.

Just as Amazon leveraged its \nengineering excellence to take advantage of cloud computing \nwhen it created Amazon Web Services (AWS), The Post fol-\nlowed the same playbook to build a technology platform that \nbecame known as Arc XP (Arc because it spanned the arc of \na publisher’s needs and XP for “experience platform”). Fast \nCompany wrote of Arc XP: “The newspaper created a plat-\nform to tackle its own challenges. Then, with Amazon-like \nspirit, it realized there was a business in helping other pub-\nlishers do the same.”17 Prakash remembered an off-site meet-\ning in which management discussed forming a “blue ocean \nstrategy”18 by focusing on an adjacency that The Post could \ndevelop so that it could win, as opposed to going head-to-\nhead with the competition in its existing space. In this case, \nas Prakash said, “To build technology for The Post and then \n‘Arc-ify’ it for other publishers.” \nFollowing that meeting, Prakash gained support to test \nthe idea first with a group of college newspapers, offering for \nthem to use it for free. As a proof of concept, a small team of \nengineers ran experiments to see if it could do multi-tenant \nsystems, how to size the hardware and at what cost, what kind \nof complications would occur if it integrated video, and so \non. These experiments allowed the team to learn a great deal \nabout a variety of relevant use cases and the feedback was \noverwhelmingly positive. \nAs depicted in Exhibit 11, Arc XP evolved into a soft-\nware-as-a-service (SaaS) business used to manage content, \nomnichannel experiences, and commerce (e.g., subscriptions \nand ad monetization). Its SaaS products were designed to \nincrease efficiency and productivity by streamlining work-\nflow, allowing newsrooms to focus less on navigating systems \nand more on producing content while growing readership. \nGiven that the templates built for The Post went into the \nsuite of Arc XP products, clients were not just buying a more \nefficient software solution—they were essentially getting a \nsubscription to the roadmap of The Post. Scot Gillespie, VP \nand general manager of Arc Publishing, put it this way: “If \nit works here, most likely it’s going to work for other large \nnewsrooms.” Prakash added: “And there are benefits both \nways, [for example] sites that are heavy users of video have \nhelped our own video platform evolve.”\nArc XP’s first paying customers were Willamette Week \nin September 2015 and then the Alaska Dispatch News the \nfollowing month. Its next big break came when the Toronto \nGlobe and Mail decided that it “[wasn’t] looking for a shrink-\nwrapped product that would void the warranty if they tin-\nkered with it”—it was more interested in partnering with The \nPost to build a modern digital experience platform (DXP). \nArc XP quickly amassed an impressive list of national and \ninternational clients, powering sites across five continents, \nincluding a large number of brand-name publications and \nbroadcasters such as the LA Times, Chicago Tribune, New York \nDaily News, Philadelphia Enquirer, and Boston Globe in the \nUnited States, and numerous international clients includ-\ning El País (in Spain), Le Parisien (in France), New Zealand \nSource: Company document, used with permission.\nExhibit 11 Arc XP Service Map\nPhoto Center\nPhoto Assets,\nGalleries\nAuthoring and\nPublishing at Scale\nEnterprise Workfow\n& Channel Mgmt\nMobile Content\nAuthoring on the Go\nHeadless Platform\nfor Omnichannel\nVOD, Clipping,\nPublishing, Streaming\nStreaming, Channels,\nAdvertising\nContent\nPersonalization\nComposer\nWebSked\nBroadcast\nVideo Center\nLive Video\nPersonalization\nPublishing Platform\nPageBuilder\nEnterprise Site Mgmt\n& React.js Flexibility\nOmnichannel\nExperience Mgmt\nTurnkey Experiences\nand Integrations\nSeamless Global\nScalability & CDN\niOS, Android, tvOS,\nFireTV, Tizen\nIntegrated Content\nTesting for Marketers\nArc I/O\nThemes\nMobile SDK\nReal-Time Testing\nDelivery\nEmail\nSocial\nDevices\nExperiences\nCommerce\nContent\nFocus less on navigating systems\nand more on creating engaging\ncontent.\nBuilt for content creators.\nSpend less on disparate\nsystems and earn more\nin revenue.\nBuilt for business.\nFocus less on maintenance\nand more on innovation.\nBuilt for developers.\nCommerce\nProducts, Inventory,\nRich Digital Storefronts\nContent Monetization\nStrategy & Activation\nAdvertising Optimization\n& Network\nCustomer Service\nat Scale\nDigital Subscriptions &\nRecurring Payments\nPaywall\nCSR\nSubscriptions\nZeus\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

By 2021, vir-\ntually every large publisher in the world was either on or \nconsidering Arc XP. \nUtilizing the same multi-tenant platform, Arc XP was \nbeginning to be used across several other verticals, such as \nbroadcasting and e-commerce facilitation for clients who \nwanted to engage more with their customers. After all, these \nclients had the same basic problem as publishers: the video \nsystem, blogging system, planning system, and distribution \nsystem were all built by different vendors—an amalgama-\ntion of black boxes, creating a nightmare for the engineers \nwho needed to make all the black boxes work together. Arc \nXP gave these sites that wanted to do both content and com-\nmerce a loosely coupled stack that worked well together. \nIn 2021, Arc XP announced that the Golden State War-\nriors planned to use Arc XP not only to do the content and \nmarketing of the team’s site but also to sell seats in team \nsuites. Other enterprise clients included BP, Avalon Bay, and \nMorningstar.\nBy 2021, Arc XP had become an extremely successful \nbusiness, powering more than 1,500 sites for hundreds of cli-\nents in over 25 countries, generating over 1.5 billion unique \nvisitors to the platform per month, tens of billions of page \nviews per month, and on track to yield $100 million in annual \nrevenue for The Post. Going forward, Arc Commerce was \nprojected to triple Arc XP’s revenue in three years.\nIn order to fuel this tremendous growth, The Post had \nbuilt a staff of more than 250 engineers in the first five \nyears after Bezos bought the organization, and planned \nto add 150 hires in the two years after 2021. The pace of \nhiring created an internal debate about whether this col-\nlection of talented engineers was being used properly in \nthe service of either a perceived competitor or an adjacent \nindustry (like broadcast) when the newsroom had plenty \nof needs of its own. Open questions included: Is Arc  \nXP operating in enough of an adjacency? Is Arc XP on \npath, or off path? From Prakash’s viewpoint, “We need to \nfigure out the ultimate steady state for Arc…and today, \nI’m glad somebody like Fred is at the helm, because he \ntrusts and he believes in it.”\nNotwithstanding the internal debate over the future of \nArc XP as a “business within a business,” the value of the \nplatform to internal customers was undeniable. Arc XP \nrepresented a tremendous resource to The Post, enabling \ndigital capabilities that few other news-media organizations \ncould match. The newsroom used Arc XP to create content \nfor all demographic segments of the market, while product \nteams used the platform to build digital products across a \nvariety of devices and channels, as well as e-commerce solu-\ntions like digital subscriptions, dynamic paywalls, and ad \noptimization. Arc XP was a major step forward in The Post’s \ndigital transformation journey.\nThe Transformation Journey \nContinued—Innovating for  \nthe Next Generation\nWhen discussing The Post’s progress as a company, Ryan was \noften asked by his colleagues, “Are we there yet? Are we out \nof the woods?” Ryan’s response was always simple and to the \npoint: “The woods are endless; we will never be out because \nthe woods are growing. As soon as we get to the edge, new \ntrees keep growing!”\nIt was clear that the Next Gen task force was formed with \nthis viewpoint in mind, and there were a lot of questions that \nit needed to answer while developing its strategic roadmap \nfor emerging audiences:\n\t\n■ With reference to the digital subscription funnel \n(Exhibit 12), what would it take for younger audiences to \nengage with and eventually subscribe to The Post?\n\t\n■ Did younger audiences value what The Post had always \nbeen known for—objective, fact-based reporting? \n\t\n■ What about younger audiences’ willingness to pay for \nquality journalism—and more broadly, how could The \nPost best monetize this segment of the market?\n\t\n■ When, where, and in what format did younger audiences \nprefer to consume news?\n\t\n■ Could The Post leverage the power of Arc XP to rapidly \ndevelop and test one or more new digital products geared \nto younger and more diverse audiences? If so, which ones?\nUncovering the answers to these questions was critical if \nThe Post was to survive another century as one of the world’s \nmost respected news-media organizations. Ryan and his \nexecutive team looked forward to constantly evolving and \ninnovating for the next generation.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

You have to do it right the first time. You \nhave to build public trust, you have to gain acceptance, you \nhave to make sure the regulatory landscape is ripe and right for \nit. Then you launch what we believe will be a very successful \nservice, and then you can scale from there.\n—Tekedra Mawakana, Waymo Co-CEO1\nOn an early morning in July 2021, Tekedra Mawakana walked \ninto Waymo’s headquarters in downtown Mountain View, \nCalifornia. Scanning the office floor, Mawakana noticed \nmostly empty desks—Waymo employees had just begun \nreturning to in-person work from the COVID-19 pandemic.2 \nIt was her third full month on the job as co-CEO.\nMawakana was named co-CEO alongside Dmitri Dolgov \nin April 2021. She previously served three years as Waymo’s \nchief operations officer (COO), and Dolgov was chief tech-\nnology officer (CTO) and a longtime engineering leader at \nWaymo. A pioneering company in the autonomous vehi-\ncle (AV) space, Waymo was a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. \n(Alphabet), a holding company and parent to Google.\nWaymo had debuted several notable AV innovations, \nincluding fully autonomous driving software; a commercial \nride-hailing service in metro Phoenix, Arizona; partnerships \nwith well-respected car manufacturers like Daimler AG,  \nNissan-Renault, Jaguar Land Rover, and Volvo; and an auton-\nomous trucking and last-mile delivery pilot service in test \nmarkets in three US states. All together, these varied initia-\ntives put Waymo in a market-leading position in the race to \nautomate driving.\nAs a graduate of Columbia Law School, Mawakana had \nsenior leadership experience in regulated industries well \nbefore her tenure at Waymo. She had served in vice presi-\ndent of public policy and deputy general counsel roles at \neBay, Yahoo!, and AOL. Her promotion to chief executive \nat Waymo was groundbreaking on several fronts; Mawakana \nbecame Waymo’s first black and first female CEO. She was \nboth a rising star and an outlier in Silicon Valley, where tech-\nnology companies had struggled to increase diversity and \nrepresentation at their highest ranks.\nMawakana assumed leadership of Waymo during a criti-\ncal time. A series of recent crashes and fatalities involving Tes-\nla’s Autopilot system prompted US safety officials to conduct \nsweeping investigations into the AV industry. Meanwhile, the \nCOVID-19 pandemic forced Waymo to suspend its burgeon-\ning ride-hailing operations in Phoenix and to shift the whole \ncompany to remote work. Waymo also faced increasing com-\npetition from upstarts and established players across its vast \nfootprint in AV software, services, and partnerships.\nMawakana had the experience to lead Waymo into a \nmore regulated and more competitive future. But she faced a \nnumber of critical decisions that required resolution. Above \nall else, in which direction should Mawakana steer Waymo?\nCompany History\nIn 2005, Sebastian Thrun, director of Stanford University’s \nArtificial Intelligence Laboratory, won a Grand Challenge \nfrom the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects \nAgency (DARPA) by successfully leading a team to deploy \nand navigate an AV through the Nevada desert. Thrun and \nhis Stanford team were quickly recruited by Google to spear-\nhead the technology giant’s efforts to build a self-driving car \nwithin its secretive “moonshot” division, known as Google X. \nTwo years later, Chris Urmson and a Carnegie Mellon team \nwon the Grand Challenge, this time hosted in an urban set-\nting in Southern California. The win highlighted the rapid \nprogress of AVs in navigating increasingly complex environ-\nments. Urmson would lead Google X’s self-driving-car proj-\nect following Thrun’s departure in 2014.\nAt Google, the self-driving-car project team focused on \nleveraging the company’s proprietary technologies, such as \nGoogle Maps and Street View, to develop vehicles capable of \nnavigating any terrain, traffic, routes, and weather without \nhuman intervention. In its first year, the team tested a fleet of \nadapted Toyota Prius cars outfitted with driverless kits in the \nSan Francisco Bay Area. By 2012, Google announced that its \nself-driving-car project had logged more than 300,000 high-\nway miles without any human assistance.3\nIn late 2015, Google recruited automotive-industry vet-\neran John Krafcik as its newest project chief. A Stanford \nmechanical-engineering grad with an MBA from the MIT \nSloan School of Management, Krafcik knew the car industry \ninside and out. He had completed stints at Ford, Hyundai, \nand TrueCar, a car price comparison website. That same year, \nGoogle completed the first fully autonomous ride on public \nThis public-sourced case was prepared by Jack McDermott (MBA/MEd ’21) and Michael Lenox, Tayloe Murphy Professor of Business Administration.

The name represented a “new way \nforward for mobility.” Waymo’s mission was “to make it safe \nand easy for people and things to get where they’re going.”5 \nThe newly formed company had its sights set on moving any-\nthing to anywhere with full autonomy.\nWaymo introduced its first commercial ride-hailing \npilot in Phoenix in 2017. The city was selected for its dry \nand consistent weather, wide streets, gradual terrain, grid-\nlike layout, and business-friendly regulations. Early beta \nusers could request a ride from Waymo’s mobile app, just \nlike requesting an Uber or Lyft. A Chrysler Pacifica mini-\nvan would arrive using a fully autonomous driving system \nsupervised by a “concierge” driver who sat in the front seat \nto monitor key safety systems and answer riders’ questions. \nWaymo’s ride-hailing service enabled its fleet to quickly test \nnew algorithms under real-world conditions. The rides also \nhelped Waymo in building public support for its autonomous \nendeavors, knowing that government officials were actively \ndiscussing how to regulate the novel industry.\nIn 2018, Waymo revealed an autonomous trucking project \nbased in Atlanta, Georgia. The foray into commercial truck-\ning brought together Waymo’s existing autonomous driver \nsystem with additional support from Google Cloud’s logistics \ntechnology to intelligently allocate loads and manage ship-\nping routes. After the announcement, Morgan Stanley valued \nWaymo at $175 billion based on expectations that roughly \n$90 billion would come from the company’s trucking and \nlast-mile delivery services by 2040.6\nAutonomous Vehicles\nOften referred to as self-driving cars, AVs had advanced from \nscience fiction to real-word use over several decades. Each \nsuccessive development in automated driving systems—from \nadaptive cruise control to forward collision warnings—brought \nthe auto industry closer to a future of fully autonomous vehi-\ncles. The question was no longer if AVs would occupy roads \nand highways, but how, when, and who would realize the full \nvalue of mass-market AVs.\nBy 2021, autonomous technologies were impacting con-\nsumers’ lives in numerous ways, even if few people had taken \na ride in an AV. Automated systems used advanced sensors \nand artificial intelligence (AI) to complete tasks like picking \nitems from the shelves of an Amazon warehouse and assisting \nsurgeons in procedures that required intricate movements. \nAVs were finding commercial applications in areas such as \nagricultural (autonomous tractors) and retail (small autono-\nmous delivery vehicles).\nAs for automobiles, customer attitudes about car owner-\nship and use were changing rapidly. A growing population \nof younger, more urban consumers were likely to say that \nmobility is more important than car ownership.7 Technolo-\ngy-enabled ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft had \ngrown into multi-billion-dollar businesses. In 2014, Amer-\nican commuters spent nearly seven billion hours in traffic. \nAVs held the potential to free up this time. AVs also promised \nto connect millions of Americans living with disabilities or \nthose living in communities underserved by public transpor-\ntation to improved mobility.8\nAVs further promised to save lives and make roads safer \nfor drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. More than 35,000 lives \nwere lost per year in the United States as a result of auto acci-\ndents, and 94% of serious car crashes were due to human \nerror. While the number of vehicles on American roads had \nsteadily increased in recent years, vehicle fatalities had either \ndecreased or remained at consistent levels (Exhibit 1). Pro-\nponents of AVs believed they could lead to an accident-free \nworld.9 In 2020, Waymo reported only 21 driver “disengage-\nments” where the driver felt it necessary to take control of \nthe vehicle.10 Last, advocates for combating climate change \nviewed AVs as an important driver of electric vehicle adop-\ntion and a step toward decarbonizing the transportation \nindustry.11\nYet critics raised concerns about the readiness of Ameri-\ncan streets and highway infrastructure to safely support AVs. \nSome critics warned against the use of personal and real-time \nlocation data used as inputs for AV algorithms. Others ques-\ntioned whether AVs would worsen traffic delays, as people \nwould adjust their behavior and increasingly opt for always-\nready transit available with one tap. Some argued that AVs \nwould contribute to increased inequality in access to modern \ntransit and could promote urban sprawl and gentrification, \nas commuters moved ever farther away from city and town \ncenters.12\nTechnology\nAutonomous driving systems were categorized from Level \n0 to Level 5 (Exhibit 2). Level 0 systems included common \ndriver-assistance features like blind-spot detection and rear \nbackup sensors, alerting drivers who remained in full con-\ntrol of the vehicle. Level 1 and 2 systems included driver- \nassistance features where the system could take control \nof steering, acceleration, and breaking. Such features were \nbecoming more common on the road. McKinsey predicted \nthat by 2030, 45% of new global car sales could reach Level \n3, where the system was fully driving the vehicle, but a driver \nwas still required to take control when prompted.13 Waymo’s \ntechnology placed its AVs at Level 4, where the car was fully \nautonomous and did not require a driver, but had safety \nfeatures such as remote assistance and geofencing to limit \noperation. Level 5 represented fully “driverless” automation \nwhere an AV navigated and responded to changes in its driv-\ning environment without human intervention. \nAutonomous driving systems used dozens of advanced \nsensors to enable the AV to steer, brake, and react to sur-\nrounding objects. Three core technologies allowed the system \nto form a three-dimensional model of a vehicle’s driving \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Waymo reported that its cameras \ncould see a stop sign from 500 meters away.15 When autono-\nmous driving systems detected an object, cameras collected \nimage data so that computer vision algorithms could iden-\ntify each object and direct the vehicle to respond as needed. \nCameras also captured invaluable images that, when synced \nwith internal computing data, could recreate any incident \nor driving scenario to continuously improve its machine- \nlearning systems or to provide accident documentation. \nCameras had several limitations, primarily their potential \nto be obstructed by common weather conditions like rain, \nfog, or snow. \nTo complement cameras, many AVs included “light detec-\ntion and ranging” sensors, better known as lidar. Lidar was \nan advanced technology that used pulsed lasers to create \nthree-dimensional models of real-world shapes and objects.16 \nDeveloped by NASA in the 1990s, lidar was capable of sending \nmillions of pulses per second to map nearby cars, people, and \nother objects during the day and in the dark of night. Lidar \nprovided AVs with near and wide detection sensors, which let \nAVs sense their immediate proximity in tight urban parking \nspaces and to spot highway debris from 300 meters away. \nWaymo unveiled its fifth-generation Waymo Driver \nsystem in 2020. It included four perimeter lidar sensors and \na roof-mounted wide sensor to provide a 360-degree view \naround every vehicle. Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, were \nskeptical of lidar, criticizing its cost and its limited ability to \ndifferentiate between harmful and harmless objects. Lidar \ncould sense an object obstructing the road but could not \ndistinguish an air-filled balloon from a rock. Yet lidar was \nbecoming increasingly common on AVs, as its cost decreased \nfrom approximately $75,000 per unit down to $7,500 in the \nyears leading up to 2021.17\nIf cameras provided an image and lidar made out the shape \nof an object, radar gave AV algorithms a sense of an object’s \nspeed and direction. Radar could detect whether objects were \nmoving, barely moving, or at rest in relation to an AV. Devel-\noped in the 1930s to detect ships, aircraft, and weather forma-\ntions, radar transmitted radio waves that returned with precise  \nvelocity and location information even in poor-visibility \nsettings where cameras could fail. As of 2021, radar systems \ncould reach hundreds of meters ahead of a vehicle and could \nfit in compact devices mounted to a vehicle’s body.18 \nTo train AI algorithms for automated driving systems, \ndevelopers used simulations to improve the accuracy and \nreliability of their automated driving models. Simulated \nenvironments provided millions of unique combinations of \ndifferent streets, traffic, weather conditions, and external \nevents—for example, a child chasing a ball into a road or a \nbicyclist slowly rolling through a stop sign—that would prove \ndifficult for real-world sensors to experience with frequent \noccurrences. Testing on public roads often required human \nsupervision, permits, hardware maintenance, and updates, \nall representing constraints not found in simulated environ-\nments. Simulations were widely used in other industries, such \nas aerospace and defense, that required extreme testing in \nhighly unique physical settings. \nAt Waymo, engineering leaders chose to invest heavily in \nsimulation to train Waymo Driver’s AI. The company initially \ndeveloped a proprietary simulation software, “CarCraft,”  \nfollowed by a more robust virtual environment, “Simulation-\nCity,” that gave Waymo’s systems enough real-world fidelity \nto be valuable for AV perception and decision-making.19 \nWhereas Waymo’s vehicles logged just over 20 million miles \non real-world streets by 2020, they simulated more than \n15 billion miles by this time.20 Waymo’s simulations also  \nbenefited from access to Alphabet’s leading technical infra-\nstructure and teams of AI and machine-learning engineers.21\nRegulation\nOpening roads to AVs faced several regulatory hurdles. \nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, welcomed Uber’s driverless car \nexperiments in 2016. Only a year later, residents soured \non Uber’s presence, citing the few, if any, jobs created and \nincreased fees for Uber’s AV ride-hailing service, which had \nbeen pitched as “free” during initial public meetings.22 Uber \nwas also active in testing its self-driving capabilities in metro \nPhoenix. Pilot tests there resulted in the first recorded fatal-\nity involving a driverless vehicle in 2018, after an Uber car \noperating in self-driving mode struck and killed a 53-year-\nold woman who was crossing the street. An Uber safety \ndriver was onboard at the time, but was watching television \non her smartphone when the accident occurred.23 Uber sus-\npended its tests in Arizona and California following the fatal \ncrash.\nAfter these events, Waymo faced increasing reports of \nharassment for its AVs in Arizona, including having rocks \nthrown at the vehicles and several being chased and forced \nto turn off the road. One man was arrested after pointing a \nhandgun at a test driver inside a Waymo Chrysler Pacifica \nminivan.24\nThe rise of AVs introduced a number of ethical concerns. \nIf algorithms programmed by software developers could pre-\ndict risks on the road, then how would AVs respond when \nfaced with certain crash scenarios that threatened the lives of \npedestrians and passengers? One Mercedes-Benz executive \nsparked controversy after suggesting in a 2016 Car and Driver \nmagazine that the luxury automaker’s AVs would always pri-\noritize the lives of passengers first: “If you know you can \nsave at least one person, at least save that one. Save the one \nin the car,” Christopher von Hugo said. “If all you know for \nsure is that one death can be prevented, then that’s your first \npriority.”25\nAlso of concern was the loss of livery and truck-driving \njobs. AV trucking upstarts raced to replace truck drivers with \nautonomous driving systems. Many experts predicted that fully \ndriverless trucks would be the first AVs to experience mass \nadoption, perhaps by 2027.26 Because of this, reports predicted \nthat America’s 3.5 million commercial truck drivers were at \nsignificant risk of economic displacement and total job loss. \nTrucking was the most common occupation in 29 US states. \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Adminis-\ntration (NHTSA) attempted to formulate a guiding frame-\nwork for the deployment of AVs, including updates to federal \nmotor vehicle standards that required exemptions for compa-\nnies testing on public roads.27 Yet there was little agreement \namong agencies on these policies, as the National Transpor-\ntation Safety Board (NTSB) openly criticized the NHTSA for \nits hands-off approach to safety following several of Tesla’s \nhigh-speed-crash incidents.\nAutomakers and technology companies spent millions of \ndollars on government lobbying each year. In 2019, Waymo \nspent more than $600,000 lobbying in Washington.28 Some \nstates, most notably Arizona and California, acted quickly \nto spur innovation that accelerated companies’ testing \nand access to public roads. Waymo launched its first ride- \nhailing pilot in Arizona after Governor Doug Doucey signed \nan executive order in 2015.29 The order mandated that AVs \nfollow all existing traffic laws observed by human drivers, but \ndidn’t establish new standards for the introduction of AVs in \nthe years ahead.\nBy 2021, most states and federal agencies maintained a \n“wait and see” approach to granting open road access to AVs. \nSenators John Thune, Republican from South Dakota, and \nGary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, cosponsored a 2017 bill \nthat sought to set federal guidelines for AVs, ease limits for \non-road testing, and allocate more than $100 billion in fund-\ning for American-made innovation in the AV space. Four \nyears later, the bill had yet to advance beyond initial hearings \nand introductory floor votes in Congress. Senator Thune put \nthe limited progress bluntly: “The U.S. regulatory framework \nhas got to catch up with private sector innovation in order for \nthese technologies to advance.”30\nCompetition\nIn the AV space, start-ups and big tech companies chal-\nlenged century-old auto companies from Detroit to Berlin \nto Tokyo. Companies formed partnerships with leading \nuniversities, such as Carnegie Mellon University’s Transpor-\ntation Research Center and Stanford University’s Dynamic \nDesign Lab. As Silicon Valley blitzed its way into the auto \nindustry, traditional car manufacturers did not sit by idly. \nFor most of the 2010s, major car manufacturers spun up \nself-driving divisions and actively invested in AV systems of \ntheir own. By 2021, Level 1 and Level 2 driver-assist features \nlike adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and rear parking \nand blind-spot alerts came standard with most new luxury \nvehicles.\nHowever, many auto manufacturers lacked the AI, soft-\nware, and advanced sensor-hardware-development capa-\nbilities needed to compete in the race to Level 4 or Level 5 \nautonomy. Across the industry, traditional carmakers like \nVolvo, Nissan, and Jaguar initially invested in AV projects of \ntheir own, only to partner with Waymo or other technology \ncompanies as technical difficulties and costs mounted. Hyun-\ndai, Nissan, and Kia engaged in talks with Apple to partner \non the design and production of an electric AV, yet a final \ndeal was never reached.31\nMany experts predicted that long-haul trucking, not \nride-hailing or consumer automotive, would be the first \nsector disrupted by AVs. Class 8 tractor trailers often trav-\neled hundreds of miles without making so much as a turn \non interstate highways. With longer, straighter routes, freight \nlines and shippers could realize greater efficiencies and cost \nsavings with autonomous trucks. McKinsey & Company esti-\nmated that autonomous trucking could cut operating costs \n45%, resulting in annual savings of $85 billion to $125 billion \nfor the US trucking industry.32\nBy 2021, AV trucking start-ups like Otto, Ike, TuSim-\nple, and Embark descended on America’s trucking market. \nTuSimple, a Chinese–American joint venture, became an \nearly mover by partnering with UPS and the US Postal Ser-\nvice. Amazon chose Embark as its pilot partner to move \ngoods between warehouses. Aurora inked partnerships with \nVolvo and Paccar, which combined to manufacture more than \n50% of all class 8 trucks sold in the United States. Meanwhile, \nWaymo committed to adapting its Waymo Driver technology \nfor the class-8 trucking market with Waymo Via. Daimler \nand Peterbilt Trucks both signed on with Waymo for pilots \nin Texas.33\nMeanwhile, a number of companies were making signif-\nicant investments to lead in the AV consumer automotive \nspace. They included an interest mix of start-ups, established \nauto makers, and large technology companies.\nGM Cruise\nIn March 2016, General Motors (GM) announced it had \nacquired Cruise, a self-driving-car start-up based in San \nFrancisco. Cruise was Waymo’s biggest competitor in the \ncommercial AV space, and it formed the core of GM’s AV \ndivision. Cruise had spent years developing AV kits that \nenabled self-driving capabilities on third-party cars. The \ncompany had successfully tested its AVs on millions of miles \nof public roads, including in its home cities of San Francisco \nand Detroit. By 2021, Cruise had logged more than 2 mil-\nlion miles driven in San Francisco, compared to only 83,000 \nby Waymo.34 Beyond leveraging GM’s assets, Cruise formed \npartnerships with top car manufacturers and tech companies, \nincluding Honda and Microsoft.\nIn January 2020, GM unveiled Cruise Origin, designed \nas an AV at Level 4 to Level 5 and intended for use in \nride-hailing services. California regulators awarded Cruise \nthe first permit for testing passenger rides without a safety \ndriver on public streets in June 2021, allowing Cruise to \nbegin pilot services in California at no charge to passen-\ngers.35 Unlike Waymo’s and Cruise’s original kits that were \nbuilt to retrofit traditional cars for self-driving uses, Cruise \nOrigin was an all-electric, purpose-built AV that had no \nmanual steering wheel for passengers. The vehicle’s interior \nlayout was designed as a shuttle to serve the fast-growing \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

With a $5 billion line of credit from \nGM, Cruise announced its plans to mass produce Cruise \nOrigin by 2023.\nTesla\nSince 2008, Tesla had disrupted traditional car manufactur-\ners with fully electric vehicles. Tesla’s luxury cars included \nmany advanced technological features, including an “Auto-\npilot” mode. Autopilot represented Level 2 driver-assistance \nautonomy, still requiring human intervention. In 2021, Tesla \ndelivered 185,000 vehicles in the first quarter—twice as many \nas the same quarter a year prior—which all came standard \nwith Autopilot. Musk, Tesla’s controversial cofounder and \nCEO, had announced the company’s intention to have “full \nself-driving” (Level 5) cars on the road by the end of 2021.36\nHowever, Tesla faced intense scrutiny after several fatal \ncrashes during which its Autopilot system was activated. These \ncrashes included an August 2019 incident where a 15-year-old \nboy was killed after a Tesla Model 3 sedan rear-ended the \npickup truck he was traveling in on a California freeway. Data \nfrom the vehicle’s computer indicated that neither the Autopi-\nlot system nor the driver slowed the car from 60 miles per hour \nuntil just before impact. The NHTSA had launched more than \na dozen investigations into Tesla’s Autopilot crashes by 2021.37\nWhile Musk predicted that fully self-driving cars would be \nready in 2021 and tweeted about the near-term possibilities of \nplaying video games in a Tesla driven by Autopilot,38 internal \nemails to California regulators revealed that Tesla was “firmly \nrooted” in Level 2 driver-assist autonomy in March 2021.39\nAudi\nAudi had developed Level 3 systems and tested its self- \ndriving TTS Coupe over 12 miles of rugged terrain to the \nsummit of Colorado’s Pikes Peak as far back as 2010. By 2018, \nAudi sold the most advanced vehicle in mass production \nwith Level 2 AV capabilities. The Audi A8 let drivers to go \nentirely hands free up to 37 miles per hour while the vehicle \ncontrolled itself.40 Audi formed partnerships with Aurora, an \nAV software start-up founded by Chris Urmson—previously \nthe director at Google X—and Nvidia, a Silicon Valley chip-\nmaker. Audi had set its sights on innovating its own version \nof premium driverless cars.\nFord\nFord had made headway on AV development by hiring  \nseveral former Google X employees and partnered with \nChinese tech giant Baidu to incorporate its autonomous \ndriving system in Ford vehicles.41 Ford committed $1 billion \nover five years to accelerate its AV capabilities with Argo AI, \nan AV software developer that had more than 700 employ-\ners in the United States and Germany.42 Ford also invested \nin Rivian, an electric vehicle company, and committed itself \nto delivering a purpose-built AV car in 2021. At the same \ntime, Ford CEO Jim Hackett expressed doubt, saying the \ncompany had “overestimated the arrival of autonomous \nvehicles.”43\nUber and Lyft\nBy 2021, the US ride-hailing market had grown into a \nduopoly. Uber and Lyft combined to own 99% of annual \nconsumer spending on shared rides, and even as rideshare \nvolume grew, both companies’ losses mounted (Exhibit 3).44 \nBoth companies invested in AV technologies for several \nyears, but reconsidered their respective courses of action \nin 2020 and 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic had deci-\nmated the ride-hailing industry: daily ridership levels had \ndropped 45% overall and as much as 70% to 90% in some \ncities. Reports found that business travel for ride-hailing \nwould not be expected to return to pre-pandemic levels \nuntil 2023.45 \nLyft exited from its AV-development efforts in April \n2021 by selling a division appropriately-named “Level 5” to \nToyota for $550 million in cash.46 A year earlier, Uber had \nmade a similar move, selling its AV technology to Aurora, a \nstart-up founded by former Google X CTO Urmson. Exit-\ning from AV research and development signaled that Uber \nand Lyft were content with waiting to leverage capabilities \ncreated by other firms. For now, Uber and Lyft focused on \nreaching profitability—both companies had yet to turn a \nprofit by 2021—and regaining ridership following the \npandemic. \nAmazon Zoox\nIn March 2019, Amazon appeared to unveil drones that \ndelivered packages to customers’ homes by air. A viral \nsocial media video showing a giant blimp deploying min-\niature drones into the air gained millions of views.47 While \nthe video proved to be fake—it had been created by a hob-\nbyist animator—Amazon already held numerous patents for \ndrone-based delivery services dating as far back as 2016.48 \nThe message was clear: Amazon was preparing to enter the \nAV race, and its services would soon be arriving at a door-\nstep near you. \nBack on the ground, Amazon made headlines again in \n2020 by acquiring Zoox, a Bay Area–based AV ride-hailing \nstart-up).49 Reports stated that Amazon paid approximately \n$1.2 billion to acquire Zoox, a lower price than expected for \nan AV company that had been valued at $3.2 billion in 2018.50 \nThe move represented Amazon’s biggest foray into the AV \nspace after years spent testing air-delivery drones and side-\nwalk-delivery bots, and investing in Aurora and partnering \nwith Embark, the AV trucking company. At the time of acqui-\nsition, Zoox already held approval for testing its ride-hailing \npilot service with a safety driver in major cities, including San \nFrancisco and Las Vegas. \nUnlike the Chrysler Pacifica minivans used by Waymo, \nZoox built its AVs from the ground up by drawing design \ninspiration from a horse-drawn carriage. The futuristic-look-\ning vehicles featured sliding glass doors, four-wheel steering \nthat rotated to turn at any angle, and no definitive front or \nback. Four passengers could sit face-to-face as the vehicle \ntraveled toward its destination in whichever direction was \noptimal.51 Zoox vehicles were also fully electric, producing \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Launched in \n2016 by several former Google and Waymo engineers, Nuro \njoined Waymo and Cruise as the only companies permitted \nto test AVs on public roads at the time. While its small, win-\ndowless robots moved slowly, Nuro was quick to announce \nlast-mile delivery pilots with FedEx and Domino’s in Hous-\nton, Texas, and same-day grocery-delivery services with \nKroger in Scottsdale, Arizona.54\nInternationally, Chinese AV delivery services JD.com, \nMeituan, and Neolix received green lights for testing in pilot \nzones in Beijing.55 These services featured a fleet of robotic \nminivans, like Nuro’s, which navigated busy sidewalks and \nbike lanes on college campuses, in office parks, and around \nresidential buildings. Through mobile apps, Chinese con-\nsumers could order items and request immediate delivery. \nOther vehicles behaved like mobile vending machines, let-\nting consumers scan a QR code to purchase ice cream or \nsnacks. \nFor years, the cost of delivery was prohibitively expen-\nsive for many local retailers and restaurants. The rise of AV \ndelivery services like Nuro and Amazon “Prime Air”—the \nofficial name of Amazon’s drone-based delivery service, \nwhich received federal approval for testing in August 2020—\npromised to move goods faster and cheaper than human \ncouriers.56 KPMG found that the cost for delivering small \npackages via AVs could be as little as 4 to 7 cents per mile. \nThe report predicted by 2040 nearly one million delivery bots \nwould be operating on US streets.57\nWaymo Today\nWaymo was organized into three core business lines: \nWaymo Driver, Waymo One, and Waymo Via. The company \nemployed approximately 2,300 workers from its headquarters \nin Mountain View, California, to its field offices in Seattle, \nAustin, and Phoenix. Waymo had raised more than $6 billion \nin funding since March 2020—including $2.5 billion raised in \nJune 2021—to maintain its three business units and continue \nforward on the road to a driverless future.58\nWaymo Driver\nWaymo Driver was the company’s proprietary technology \nsystem, enabling autonomous mobility in partner vehicles. \nWaymo touted the system as the “World’s Most Experienced \nDriver,” a combination of hardware, software, and comput-\ning that combined to drive AVs.59 Waymo Driver worked by \nequipping third-party vehicles, such as the Jaguar I-PACE \ncrossover SUV or Chrysler Pacifica minivans, with spe-\ncially designed hardware and sensors.

Between 2009 and 2021, \nWaymo reported that its Waymo Driver technology had \ndriven 20 million miles safely on public roads.61 \nWaymo One\nWaymo One was the company’s AV ride-hailing service, \nwhich was limited to operating in metro Phoenix. Since 2020, \nthe service had been available through the Waymo app and \nwas integrated with search results on Google Maps. Waymo \nOne’s fleet consisted of roughly 400 hybrid Chrysler Pacifica \nminivans, most of which were staffed by an onboard safety \nconcierge. The ride-hailing service had yet to turn a profit.62 \nWaymo signaled tentative plans to expand Waymo One’s ser-\nvice into new cities such as San Francisco, but provided no \nspecific timetable for its expansion.63\nWaymo Via\nWaymo Via was the company’s autonomous trucking \nand delivery line for transporting goods. In 2019, Waymo \nannounced it would pilot a version of the Waymo Driver \ntechnology adapted for class-8 tractor-trailer trucks and \nlocal delivery vans. Waymo initially launched trucking pilots \nbetween Google data centers in Atlanta before forging a \npartnership with J.B. Hunt in 2021. Jointly becoming North \nAmerica’s fifth-largest commercial trucking fleet, Waymo \nand J.B. Hunt ran tests on Interstate 45 shipping lanes across \nTexas. Trained safety operators remained on board for any \nnecessary interventions and for docking once the vehicle \narrived at each destination.64 \nWaymo Via announced its expansion with local delivery \nservices. The company extended its partnership with Daim-\nler AG to outfit Ram ProMaster vans for last-mile delivery \nservices. Waymo also launched pilots to deliver UPS pack-\nages on existing Waymo One routes in Phoenix. Cruise \nfollowed with a strategic investment from Walmart, which \nincluded a delivery pilot of its own for Walmart goods in \nScottsdale, Arizona. By 2021, Waymo, Cruise, and Nuro all \nran AV delivery pilots within a few neighboring cities in and \naround Phoenix.65\nThe Autonomous Road Ahead\nSince its earliest days as a secretive “moonshot” project within \nGoogle, Waymo was a leader in the increasingly crowded and \ncompetitive AV space. Many analysts predicted that Waymo \ncould be eyeing an initial public offering (IPO) in 2022, but \nfor now Mawakana had to drive the company toward a viable \nand defensible growth strategy. The company was a part of \nAlphabet’s “Other Bets” division, which collectively lost more \nthan $3.8 billion in 2020.66\nWaymo’s valuation once reached as high as $200 billion. \nAfter its most recent fundraising, this figure was reported \nto be closer to $30 billion in 2021. This 85% decline indi-\ncated that investors had cooled after years-long delays in \ngo-to-market plans that were increasingly common in the \nAV space.67 While Waymo was an early mover in AVs, the \ncompany’s future remained unclear, with increased regula-\ntion, competition, and concerns of continued delays across \nits threefold business lines.\nTekedra Mawakana was now tasked with leading Waymo \nand its 2,300 employees on a pursuit that included a ride-hail-\ning service, software development and partnerships, and \ntrucking and last-mile delivery services. It was hard enough \nto get autonomous mobility right in one context, she thought, \nas Waymo continued pursuing research and development on \nAV technologies across several fronts.\nMawakana knew that the road to an autonomous driv-\ning future had taken longer—and cost far more—than most \nhad expected. Analysts now predicted that companies pur-\nsuing AVs would be required to invest another $6 billion to \n$10 billion just to maintain pace over the next few years.68 \nMawakana recognized the need to fend off competitors \nand select strategic priorities intentionally if Waymo was to \ndeliver financial returns to Alphabet and benefits to safer, \nmore efficient transportation. It was time for Mawakana to \nsteer Waymo on its own new way forward.\nNotes\n1.

Davies was the \npresident of Wellington Brewery, a well-established craft \nbrewery located in Guelph, Ontario, Canada.  Wellington \nBrewery had recently completed a successful expansion of its \noperations. The expansion had taken place during a period of \nexplosive growth in Canada’s craft brewery industry. As part \nof the expansion project, the company had increased the size \nof its premises by 1,700 square metres (18,300 square feet). \nIt had also upgraded its facilities with new state-of-the-art \nequipment for brewing, canning, and water treatment. The \nexpansion process had successfully transitioned Wellington \nBrewery from a small company to a medium-sized operation. \nWithin only a few years, the craft brewery’s operations had \nexpanded significantly.\nAmong its greatest assets, Wellington Brewery acknowl-\nedged its employees, cutting-edge equipment, and product \nquality and consistency. In fact, the brewery sought to create \nconsistently handcrafted beer products with every batch, and \nnever took shortcuts in the brewing process. The recently \nupgraded equipment significantly increased the company’s \nefficiency in the beer-canning process and improved qual-\nity control of the product. These enhancements clearly sup-\nported Wellington Brewery’s overall goal of expansion across \nthe entire Ontario market. The brewery already performed \nexceptionally well locally. The next step was to continue \nexpanding beyond its own community and throughout the \nprovince.\nWellington Brewery faced strong competition from \nother craft breweries in the province, but also from giant \nmultinational “macrobreweries.” However, the company \nboasted a competitive advantage over macrobreweries \nsimply due to its smaller scale, which allowed the craft \nbrewery to offer more expensive and exquisite ingredients \nin its beer, such as interesting fruits and carefully chosen \nadditives, to brew a selection of unique-tasting, small-batch \ncraft beers.\nAfter completing its recent expansion project, Welling-\nton Brewery faced the challenges of an unpredictable and \noversaturated market. Ontario’s craft brewery industry was \ncharacterized by unexpected growth, shifting consumer pref-\nerences, and intense competition for shelf space at limited \nretail outlets. Davies urgently needed to plan his company’s \ncontinuing expansion and ensure that Wellington Brewery \nremained relevant and financially strong during challenging \ntimes.\nIndustry Background\nThe Beer Industry in Canada\nIn 2018, the global beer market was worth CA$895 billion1 \nand was expected to continue growing.2 Of the estimated \n25,000–30,000 breweries around the world, most produced \nless than 1,000 hectolitres (hl) per year.3 Beer was Canada’s \nmost popular alcoholic beverage. In 2018, Canadian beer \nsales reached $20.2 billion, and were forecasted to reach \n$22.1 billion by 2023.4 The Canadian beer market was dom-\ninated by two multinational companies—Molson Coors \nBeverage Company and Labatt Brewing Company Lim-\nited (owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev). These two indus-\ntry giants controlled 50 per cent of the Canadian market, \nwhile the myriad of much smaller craft breweries together \naccounted for only approximately a 9 per cent share. \nBetween 2016 and 2018, Canada saw a 30 per cent increase \nin the launch of new breweries, reaching a total of 901 com-\npanies in the industry. Despite this increase, however, beer \nconsumption in Canada remained relatively flat over the \nprevious decade and dropped by 0.7 per cent during 2019.5 \nThis trend was attributed to various factors, including an \nincreasingly health-conscious consumer base; lower drink-\ning rates among younger customers; and growing cider, \nwine, and spirits industries.6 Non-alcoholic beer also saw \ntremendous growth in 2018, with a 31 per cent growth in \ntotal volume.7\nThe beer industry was unpredictable for various reasons: \nconsumption seasonality, explosive growth, changing con-\nsumer preferences (e.g., products being made sustainably), \naggressive innovation from smaller breweries, and uncer-\ntain Canadian and provincial regulations. Until 2015, only \nthe government-owned Liquor Control Board of Ontario \n(LCBO)8 and The Beer Store (TBS) were authorized to sell \nalcoholic beverages. In 2019, TBS accounted for 63 per cent \nof total beer sales in the province, which was a decrease from \n66 per cent in 2018. TBS traditionally sold mainstream beer \nNadège Levallet, Corey Wood, and Suchit Ahuja wrote this case solely to provide material for class discussion.

The LCBO also acted as \nwholesaler to approximately 450 grocery stores in the prov-\nince. In 2019, the LCBO’s sales of beer, wine, and cider to gro-\ncery stores grew by 60.8 per cent for a total of $246.7 million. \nThat same year, grocery store sales represented 80 per cent \nof its market share gain by volume. The LCBO’s e-commerce \nchannel was also steadily growing by 72 per cent year-over-\nyear, reaching $19.5 million in 2019.9 The price of alcohol was \nregulated and consistent throughout the province, regard-\nless of the specific retailer.10 The LCBO reported directly to \nCanada’s Minister of Finance and provided $6.39 billion in \nrevenue. In 2019, the LCBO transferred $2.37 billion in divi-\ndends to the Ontario Government.11\nFor convenience, beer distribution channels in Canada \nwere classified into two categories: on-premises and \noff-premises. On-premises locations, which allowed con-\nsumers to drink beer directly, included bars and restau-\nrants. Off-premises locations, which allowed consumers \nto purchase beer but not to directly consume it, included \nthe LCBO, TBS, grocery stores, and e-commerce outlets. In \n2018, the LCBO and TBS were the most popular off-premises \nbeer distribution channels, generating $5.0 billion in sales. \nOn-premises locations such as bars and restaurants gener-\nated $9.0 billion in beer sales.12\nCraft Beer\nThe craft brewing industry, a sub-sector of the overall \nbeer industry, offered premium beverage products. From \n2014 to 2018, the Canadian craft beer industry experienced \nsignificant growth, almost doubling in revenue from $1.0 \nbillion to $1.9 billion.13 Although a comprehensive defini-\ntion for the terms “craft brewery” or “microbrewery” was \nnot officially established, microbreweries were understood \nto represent companies that produced less than 50,000 hl \nannually.14 The federal government typically licensed craft \nbreweries that produced 400,000 hl or less per year and were \nindependently owned and operated.15 For example, Brick \nBrewing Co. Limited (renamed Waterloo Brewing Ltd. in \n2019) in Kitchener, Ontario, was a certified craft brewery.16 \nMost craft breweries in Canada produced 5,000 hl or less \nper year.17 Companies that produced over 400,000 hl, such \nas the two multinational beer companies that dominated \nCanada’s beer industry, were categorized as “macrobrewer-\nies.” In contrast, the Canadian craft brewing industry was \nhighly fragmented, with hundreds of small breweries typi-\ncally focused on serving local communities, although some \nof the larger craft breweries catered to the entire province. \nOntario was home to 315 breweries, but only two-thirds \nof them sold their beer in retail outlets such as the LCBO, \nTBS, or grocery stores.18\nCraft beer consumers, whose tastes changed rapidly, were \nmainly interested in the experience, locality, and the variety \nof products that craft breweries offered. In contrast to mac-\nrobrewery customers, these consumers also tended to have \nless brand loyalty and to prefer ale to lager.19 Sales of ale, the \nmost consumed craft beer, grew from $905.2 million in 2014 \nto $1.7 billion in 2018.20 Emerging and alternative trends in \nthe industry included canned nitrogenated beer21 and non- \nalcoholic beer.\nDespite environmental uncertainty and regulatory con-\nstraints affecting the entire industry, the Canadian craft beer \nindustry continued to grow. Reasons for growth included \nchanging demographics, consumer preferences for unique \nproducts and new experiences, and overall support from \nvital retail partners.22 Specifically in Canada, the growth of \nthe craft beer industry was influenced by the country’s gener-\nally favourable demographic, social, political, economic, and \nenvironmental characteristics (see Exhibit 1).\nCanada was a North American country that shared its southern border with the United States. The country’s demographics \nwere diverse. In 2019, it had a population of over 37 million people, of which almost 90 per cent were either immigrants or \ndescendants of immigrants. Canada’s population included over 100 indigenous tribes comprising approximately 250,000 \nindigenous Canadians. Canada was democratic country with a parliamentary system in a constitutional monarchy. As Canada \nwas a member of the British Commonwealth, its reigning monarch was Queen Elizabeth II, although her role in terms of  \nCanada was limited. Canada was organized as a federation, with 10 provinces and three territories, and three government \nlevels: federal, provincial or territorial, and municipal. Canada had maintained strong political stability and was considered  \none of the safest countries in the world.\nCanada was a good place to do business. It featured a growing global trade network that provided Canadians with access to \nglobal market opportunities. Specifically, Canada had 14 free trade agreements in place with 51 countries, giving it preferential \naccess to international markets. The Liberal Party of Canada, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, had been in power since \nOctober 2015, during which time several major regulatory laws and changes had taken place that impacted the food and bev-\nerages industry. Specific to the beer industry, policies governing alcohol availability were set and enforced by provincial liquor \ncontrol or licensing boards. In all jurisdictions except the province of Alberta, these same provincial boards were responsible \nfor the sale of alcohol through their own network of retail stores. Regulations regarding the sales of beer had been revised \nto allow beer sales in grocery stores and convenience stores in Ontario, starting in late 2015. Alcohol sale regulations varied \nwidely across all Canadian provinces and territories, with Ontario having the most complex system. Therefore, doing business \nin multiple jurisdictions was usually limited to larger businesses and smaller craft breweries tended to sell their products only \nwithin their own province.\nExhibit 1 Doing Business in Canada\n(Continued )\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Davies started working \nat Wellington Brewery in 1995 but left the company in 2000 \nto pursue a career in the chemical industry. However, in \n2010, Davies returned to Wellington Brewery as partner and \nvice-president, with responsibilities in the company’s sales and \nmarketing divisions. In 2016, Davies was appointed president. \nAt the time, he owned 60 per cent of the brewery and held 90 \nper cent voting rights. The remaining control of the company \nwas spread among small investors with limited voting rights.\nExhibit 1 (cont.)

Canada’s gross domestic product was expected to increase  \nby 1.8 per cent in 2020 and 1.9 per cent in 2021, consisting of only minor improvements from the 2019 gain of 1.7 per cent. \nHealthy labour markets and modest increases in consumer spending were likely to benefit Canada’s economy.\nLabour laws and regulatory changes continued to have an impact on Canada’s workforce. The government intended to mod-\nernize federal labour standards to benefit Canadian workers and assist employers. Existing and upcoming changes included \nimproving eligibility for entitlements, helping with work–life balance, providing fair treatment and compensation for unpre-\ndictable (e.g., short-term, contract, seasonal) work, ensuring sufficient notice and compensation when jobs are terminated, \nand improving the administration of labour standards.\nBusiness investments in Canada had trended downward in recent years, and Canada’s trade sector would continue to be  \nimpacted by minimal global growth. In contrast, interest rates were not expected to change in 2020, as global economic condi-\ntions stabilized.\nAs one of Canada’s key provinces, Ontario produced 37 per cent of the national gross domestic product and featured distinc-\ntive exports, manufacturing expertise, resources, and innovation trends. Ontario was known for its manufacturing industries, \nincluding medical devices, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and information and communications technologies. Additionally, \nthe province was home to more than half of Canada’s best farmland. It featured more than 50,000 farms that produced almost \n25 per cent of all farm revenue in Canada.\nMany of Canada’s manufacturing sectors were shifting toward Industry 4.0 digitalization, automation, and data exchange in \nmanufacturing technologies and business systems to drive innovation. It was becoming increasingly affordable for companies \nto make the digital shift, as consumers become more technology-savvy than ever.\nCanadians were increasingly relying on mobile devices for everyday living—especially shopping. Increasingly, consumers \nrelied on mobile payments, navigating the Internet on a smart phone, and numerous other mobile platform services. Software-\nas-a-service technology and data warehouse management solutions provided companies with new sources of data and \nanalysis for higher efficiency and trend monitoring. Artificial intelligence and data analytics were key drivers of digital transfor-\nmation and automation for businesses, both internally and throughout the supply chain.\nSeveral cultural trends were likely to impact future Canadian businesses. First, millennials (people born between 1980 to  \n2000) were at the forefront of the consumer revolution and were often characterized as being frugal, shrewd, and lacking in \nbrand loyalty. They were most likely to use smart phones, social networking, and online shopping. Increasingly, Canadians \nwere seeking personalized and immediate interaction with instant access to information and goods, such as Amazon.com  \nInc.’s promise of next-day delivery on many of its products. Canadians were also exercising more, consuming more natural  \nand organic products, and choosing products based on dietary restrictions.\nCanada was North America’s largest country by area, with vast natural open spaces. Despite some environmental concerns \nsuch as pollution of natural regions and rapidly changing weather patterns, numerous tourists chose Canada for its natural \nlandscape and scenery. Climate change, clean fuels, carbon tax strategy, air quality, environmental testing, and renewable \nenergy developments were among its environmental concerns. Businesses in Canada increasingly sought green options to \nbecome more environmentally sustainable with initiatives such as reducing single-use plastics, improved waste diversion, \nsustainable food initiatives, use of nuclear power, and electric transportation.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

During his interactions with customers at \nthe LCBO stores, he would often ask people why they chose \na specific product. He was proud of Wellington Brewery’s \naward-winning beers and sought to expand people’s palette \nwith high-quality tasting products. As the brewery expanded, \nDavies knew that upcoming decisions were critical. He \nbelieved that any decisions about the business strategy and \nlong-term vision would need to respect, yet help evolve, the \ncompany’s culture.\nCompany Background\nWellington Brewery’s expansion in 2015–16 increased the \norganization’s annual brewing capacity from 24,000 hl to \n80,000 hl. In addition to state-of-the-art brewing equip-\nment upgrades, the company purchased a second building \nto make room for offices and inventory, a new canning line \nto increase efficiency, and an enterprise resource planning \n(ERP) system. The company also installed a complete water \ntreatment system to improve the longevity of the equipment \nand to reduce water usage and waste.\nAs of 2019, the brewery employed 45 staff, including full-\ntime and part-time positions, depending on the seasonal-\nity of the business. Wellington Brewery’s respect and pride \nin its employees was reflected by the company’s impressive \nretention rate. For example, the brewery’s vice-presidents of \nfinance, sales, and brewing had been with the company for \nan average of 16 years. Its experienced staff helped Wellington \nBrewery master the challenging product submission process \nthrough the LCBO, as Davies explained:\nBecause we’ve been around so long, we know the process \nto plan timing-wise. We got it so our last couple brands—\nour product launches—we were early to market and we \nhad things well in advance to LCBO. We got approvals \nthrough, and we got it out there.\nLong-tenured employees contributed to corporate \nmemory, provided stability within the business, facilitated \ncreativity, and readily provided their expertise. However, \nDavies was aware that long-time employees could also be \nmore resistant to change and more heavily relied upon, rather \nthan establishing more automated processes. Wellington \nBrewery’s top management team described the company cul-\nture as “very family and community-oriented.” This type of \nculture worked well as long as the company remained rel-\natively small. However, with the expansion of the brewery \nand additional staff added to the team, Davies acknowledged \nthe need for a more balanced approach between focusing on \nmaintaining a “family” feel and integrating more structured \nroles into the business. Davies noted that “when you’re small, \neverybody’s doing everything. But now, the thing is, you \ncan’t. You can’t do everything. You can’t have those pressures \nall the time.”\nSome members of the top management team were respon-\nsible for multiple managerial roles, which reduced their abil-\nity to take on additional tasks or projects. The brewery had \nto start implementing its new inventory management system, \nbut it was difficult to find the right time and the right person \nto manage the project, which incurred delays. That person \nwould likely to be selected from among the busiest people in \nthe company. Stress and confusion arose in reporting lines \ndue to multiple roles held by some employees. Davies felt \nthat a revised organizational structure was needed to support \ngrowth plans, formalize processes, clarify roles and responsi-\nbilities, and reduce employee workload.\nCommunity\nThe community was a crucial element of the craft brewing \nindustry. Craft beers were locally handcrafted, authentic \nproducts. Wellington Brewery maintained its connection to \nthe community through engagements in local events, char-\nitable work, and donations to local causes. Davies felt that \n“those decisions kind of become stand-in for a lot of things  \nI think are really important, and in broader relationship \nbuilding.” Some initiatives included collaborations with local \norganizations, such as donations to Pride support groups \nbased on the sale of a specific beer brand or hiring local art-\nists to design beer coasters. Despite its goal to expand across \nthe entire province, Wellington Brewery was eager to retain \nthe local brand feel and connections it had established within \nits community.\nA craft brewery’s community was dependent on location, \nsize, and strategy. Some regions and communities were more \nreceptive than others to craft beer. In fact, the number of \nCanadian beer drinkers that consumed craft products ranged \nwidely from 26 per cent to 50 per cent of the population, \ndepending on the geographical location.25 Therefore, craft \nbreweries needed to decide whether to focus their efforts \non competing in a popular craft beer market or instead tap \ninto a smaller market and build up the brand by educating \nnew craft beer consumers. In Ontario’s highly competitive \nToronto market, for example, a craft brewery’s community \ncould vary from the entire city, to a geographical portion \nsuch as east Toronto or the downtown core, or even a spe-\ncific neighbourhood such as The Danforth or Etobicoke.  \nA brewery could focus on specific stores within a small area \nto sell its products to a targeted consumer group. Alterna-\ntively, it could instead cater to a much broader range of con-\nsumers. For example, Waterloo Brewing Ltd. chose to expand \nits market share by acquiring province-wide distribution \nrights for several major beer brands including Laker, Seagram \nCoolers, and LandShark.26\nSmaller breweries looking for growth needed to be more \ncreative due to their limited access to capital. An alternative \nto acquisition was to develop long-term sustainable relation-\nships with retailers outside the community. To achieve this, \ncraft breweries could leverage their existing connections with \nlocal LCBO stores and licensees to help them expand. Other \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

These \npractices helped produce resourceful teams and promoted \nrapid pivoting when information was needed. For example, \nwhen Wellington Brewery’s equipment was experiencing \nrapid degradation due to the city’s hard water, the company’s \nvice-president of brewing and another employee leveraged \ntheir expertise to build a network of contacts who worked in \nwastewater management and water treatment services. Using \nthis knowledge, the company was able to assess the problem \nand procure a new water system. One employee outlined his \nexperience:\nIt all ties back into [the fact that] we always try to get peo-\nple out in the community to try and learn to make better \nbeers. The [brewery] would put me out in trade shows \nto connect with people and network. So, if any of these \nthings come up, I know who to contact.\nProduct Focus\nWellington Brewery was customarily known as an English-\nstyle craft brewery, with ale as its featured beer type. In the \npast several years, its product line focused on three core \nbrands and an assortment of experimental small-batch and \nseasonal beers. The company’s high-volume production \nbrands—a traditional ale, an India pale ale, and a lager—\nwere aimed at a wide consumer base and required different \nbrewing strategies than its low-volume production brands, \nwhich were usually experimental beers aimed at consumers \nseeking a novel beer-drinking experience. Therefore, the two \ndifferent product lines required the company to attract two \ndifferent customer segments, which also divided Wellington \nBrewery staff members.\nA senior executive felt that staff members were conflicted \nbetween “putting out products that sell versus products that \nare innovative.” Davies agreed that producing award-winning \nexperimental beers would build “street cred” (short for “street \ncredibility” or acceptability among fashionable beer consum-\ners) and thus draw more customers to the brewery. However, \nhe also recognized that although lager was not Wellington \nBrewery’s choice of beer type, it represented the largest beer \nmarket segment and could be an important source of revenue \nfor the company. Because traditional ale products had always \nbeen associated with Wellington Brewery’s identity, adding a \nlager to the product mix would require a significant shift in \nbusiness culture.\nCompetitors\nWellington Brewery viewed the two international macro-\nbreweries, Molson Coors Beverage Company and Anheus-\ner-Busch InBev, as major competitors in Canada’s overall \nbrewing industry. Wellington Brewery’s mainstream beers \nwere intended to increase sales and faced direct competition \nfor shelf space from the two brewery giants. However, over \nthe previous three years, the overall craft brewery segment \nhad helped flatten Canadian sales volumes of the two mul-\ntinational breweries, which reflected a consumer trend away \nfrom traditional beer consumption.27\nWellington Brewery saw all other craft breweries as col-\nlaborators, but it nonetheless competed against local and \nnearby craft breweries. For example, Guelph’s innovative \nsmall-batch craft brewery was home to Royal City Brewery \nand Fixed Gear Brewing, while in nearby Waterloo, the mid-\nsized multi-branded brewery Waterloo Brewing Ltd. had \nearned annual revenue of $53.7 million in 2019.28 Guelph \nwas also home to Sleeman Breweries (owned by Sapporo \nBreweries), a large traditional brewery that sold both domes-\ntic and imported beer products.\nThe Production of Beer\nBeer had been produced in Canada since 1646. Key ingredi-\nents in the production of beer included malts (i.e., converted \ngrains, often barley), hops (i.e., flowers of the hop plant), \nand yeast. Specific temperatures and times depended on the \nbeer’s recipe. Yeasts were re-added throughout the process to \nproduce sugars, some of which transformed into alcohol.29 \nThe company’s brewmaster would create recipes for tradi-\ntional beer (e.g., lager or ale) or experimental beer (e.g., sour \nfruit beer) by using a variety of additives and customizations. \nCompared with both smaller craft breweries and larger tradi-\ntional breweries, Wellington Brewery’s advantage was its abil-\nity to produce large amounts of experimental beer, although \nsome ingredients and additives proved challenging to scale \nfor high volumes.\nThe addition of new canning and brewing equipment \nenabled Wellington Brewery to significantly increase its \nefficiency. The company went from producing 20 hl per \nlarge batch in six hours to 40 hl per large batch in only two \nand a half hours. The new equipment also helped increase \nmalt-processing efficiency and reduce water waste. Brewed \nbeer sat in tanks for approximately two to four weeks until \nit was ready for packaging. In recent years, cans had become \nthe predominant packaging choice over glass bottles. The \nshift to cans provided a more environmental option and \nresulted in a better-tasting product. Cans could block ultra-\nviolet light more effectively than bottles, which helped limit \nproduct spoilage.30\nWellington Brewery employed a pilot system to exper-\niment with different combinations of ingredients. Its \nlow-volume capability allowed the company to produce \nsingle products, or “one-offs,” and later scale up to large \nvolumes. Wellington Brewery was thus able to quickly react \nto consumer trends and release new products each week \nin the company’s brewhouse. These frequent releases pro-\nvided an opportunity to experiment, gauge customer reac-\ntions, and collect customer preference data at a relatively \nlow cost.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

An annual excise tax was based on \nthe beer’s alcohol percentage and production volume.31 In \n2018 and 2019, Canada’s alcoholic beverage industry faced \nvarious challenges, and some opportunities, due to legis-\nlation changes. Legalization of cannabis in Canada went \ninto effect in October 2018, and cannabis-infused beverages \nwere allowed to be sold starting in December 2019.32 These \nlegislative initiatives provided opportunities for craft brew-\neries to enter the new cannabis-infused beverage market. \nIn addition, the sale of beer in grocery stores, which had \nstarted in December 2015,33 had reached an Ontario gov-\nernment goal of enabling 450 grocery stores in the province \nto sell beer. This new market segment provided access to a \nnew retail option for many breweries across Ontario.34 In \n2016, the sale of alcohol was made available by mail directly \nto consumers,35 which opened a new opportunity for many \nbreweries to set up an e-commerce platform. Discussions \nhad also begun on the topic of making the sale of alco-\nhol available in Ontario’s numerous convenience stores, \nalthough no decisions had yet been made on this potential \nnew distribution outlet.\nWellington Brewery’s management team had not yet \nexpressed an interest in the cannabis-infused beverage market. \nHowever, grocery store sales provided high margins, and \ne-commerce was an especially promising sales vehicle for the \nupcoming Christmas holiday season, so the company decided \nto enter both of these markets. Discussions by Ontario’s regu-\nlators on the prospect of allowing beer sales in the province’s \nconvenience stores were still in early stages and remained \nunpredictable. Wellington Brewery was also licensed for the \nsale of cider, but had yet to decide whether or not to diversify \ninto this segment, which could be an important consideration \nif a drop in beer sales occurred. However, the company was \ncomfortable remaining focused on beer production at this \nstage. As Davies noted, the company had “historically done \nbeer very well and still [saw] lots of room to grow.”\nWellington Brewery’s Sales  \nMix and Distribution\nWellington Brewery generated revenues from both on- \npremises sales channels, such as the company’s onsite \nbrewhouse or licensees (e.g., bars and restaurants), and \noff-premises sales channels, such as retailers. The brew-\nhouse was the company’s most profitable revenue source but \nrepresented only a small portion of total revenues, whereas \noff-premises retailer sales channels such as the LCBO and \ne-commerce, generated greater revenue amounts that were \nfundamental to the company’s growth. Another important \nrevenue channel was contract brewing, which referred to \nWellington Brewery offering its brewing premises and exper-\ntise to other breweries that did not have their own facilities. \nThe breakdown of Wellington Brewery’s sales mix consisted \nof approximately 25 per cent LCBO, 30 per cent licensees,  \n25 per cent contract brewing, 10 per cent TBS, and 10 per \ncent brewhouse revenue.\nAlthough macrobreweries typically sold their product in \nstandard cases of 24 beers through TBS, craft brewery sales \nconsisted mainly of low-number packs or single-unit sales. \nTherefore, the craft brewery segment’s relationship with TBS \nwas increasingly becoming insignificant. In contrast, the craft \nbrewery segment’s relationship with the LCBO, licensees, con-\ntract brewing, and e-commerce was critical (see Exhibit 2).\nThe LCBO\nThe LCBO dominated retail distribution in Ontario. Getting \na product onto the retailer’s shelves was challenging for craft \nbreweries. The LCBO used a web-based product submission \nprocess called the New Item Submission System (NISS).36 \nThis process required a new product to pass through a series \nof stages, ranging from setting price parameters to product \ntasting, which lasted at least six weeks. Several factors affected \na craft brewery’s ability to be accepted and remain active \nin the LCBO stores. After a product was accepted, its shelf \nspace was reviewed weekly. The LCBO preferred stocking \nbeer products in cans of 473 millilitres and required a mini-\nmum of 20 litres of the product to be sold in each store within \na specific period. Each year, a random sample from every \nproduct listed on the LCBO was sent to its quality assurance \ndepartment for analysis of alcohol content and packaging.37 \nIf a product’s alcohol content was found to be over its adver-\ntised level by as little as 0.5 per cent, the entire listing could \nbe removed from the shelves. Therefore, Wellington Brewery \nmade consistency a critical aspect of its business.\nBefore completing the NISS process, a craft brewery \nneeded to establish a relationship with LCBO’s head office \nand individual store managers. Dedicated brewery sales teams \nparticipated in ongoing relationship-building efforts and pre-\nsented their new products. This process was labour-intensive \nand competitive. Shelf space at the LCBO stores was limited, \nand macrobreweries occupied a considerable amount of the \navailable space. Davies was aware that new-product applica-\ntions to the LCBO were required for both core and seasonal \nbrands. The LCBO maintained an updated product-need item \nlist through the NISS to guide new-product submissions.38 As \nDavies explained, “the better a product’s performance ratio, \nthe better chance it had at getting a subsequent product in, or \nin scoring a seasonal listing.”\nWellington Brewery modified its tactics over time to \nmaintain a positive relationship with the LCBO. For example, \nthe company decided to adopt the LCBO’s preferred format of \n473-millilitre cans for its beer. As well, the company used its \nown distribution service, rather than a third party, to better \nleverage opportunities to build rapport and connections with \nbuyers. Among other strategies, Wellington Brewery offered \ntasting notes and comparable products to the LCBO store \nmanagers and ensured quality and consistency through lab \ntesting before submission of its products. The LCBO also \noffered companies monthly in-store marketing opportu-\nnities, such as product sampling services and end-of-aisle \nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

However, the cost of these promotions was usu-\nally too high for craft breweries such as Wellington Brewery, \nand was therefore used mainly by macrobreweries.\nLicensees\nAccording to Davies, retail sales channels tended to provide \nhigher margins for the brewery than licensee sales channels, \nsuch as bars and restaurants. However, licensees also served a \ncritical purpose of promoting a local presence and collecting \nvaluable information about consumer trends, product sales, \nand competitors. Therefore, Wellington Brewery opted for \na relatively high portion of its product distribution through \nlicensees, compared with most of its competitors. Its sales \nmix was set at approximately 60 per cent retail and 40 per \ncent licensees, compared with the sales mix of most competi-\ntors at 80 per cent retail and 20 per cent licensees.\nHowever, securing permanent beer brand placement \non-tap at a licensee, such as a bar or restaurant, was becoming \nincreasingly difficult. As Davies explained, macrobreweries \ntended to offer financial incentives to licensees to gain on-tap \nbrand placement, which craft breweries were unable to afford. \nAs well, with licensees frequently rotating their beer taps and \nadding new product lines, the required amount of beer from \neach brewery could drop significantly. Therefore, although \nDavies delivered beer kegs to licensees in person to build \nconnections and gather information, he was also working \ndiligently to grow Wellington Brewery’s retail presence, espe-\ncially through the LCBO. The aim was to gradually reduce the \ncompany’s dependence on licensees and contract brewing. To \nachieve this goal, the business needed to find ways to make \nits core brands self-sustainable by generating consistent and \nlong-term revenue through higher-margin retail channels, \nwhile reducing reliance on lower-margin revenue streams.\nContract Brewing\nContract brewing provided a crucial revenue source for many \nbreweries, despite its low margins. Wellington Brewery pro-\nvided its production facility and expertise, at a cost, to brew-\neries that did not have their own brewing premises, which \nhelped counter lower-than-expected sales of its own product. \nHowever, contract brewing did introduce various challenges. \nThe process was labour-intensive and tended to require \nextensive mentoring, especially for less established contract \nbreweries. There was also a potential impact on Wellington \nBrewery’s financial situation if a contract brewery was unable \nto pay for the services rendered.\nCriteria\nThe LCBO\nLicensees\nE-commerce\nThe Beer Store\nOn-Site \n(Brewhouse)\nContract \nBrewing\nDescription\nGovernment- \nregulated retail \noutlets offering \nwine, beer, and \nspirits\nRestaurants \nand bars\nOnline  \ndistribution\nGovernment- \nregulated retail \noutlets offering \nbeer\nSelling at  \nown brick-and-\nmortar store\nProducing \nbeer for other \ncompanies\nMarket  \npotential\nProvincial\nProvincial\nProvincial\nProvincial\nLocal\nN/A\nPercentage of \nrevenues\n25%\n30%\nNegligible\n10%\n10%\n25%\nProfit margin\nHigh\nLow\nLow\nHigh\nHigh\nMedium\nEase of access \nto market\nDifficult\nDifficult\nEasy\nDifficult\nEasy\nMedium\nCustomer \ninsights\nDigThisData \nonline platform \nanalytics\nDelivery and \nsales represen-\ntatives\nShopify online \nplatform  \nanalytics\nDigThisData \nonline platform \nanalytics\nPersonal \ncontact and \nTouchBistro \npoint-of-sale \nsystem\nN/A\nBrand  \nrecognition\nHigh\nHigh\nLow\nMedium\nMedium\nNone\nDedicated \nsales team\nYes\nYes\nN/A\nYes\nN/A\nN/A\nOpportunities \nfor growth\nHigh\nMedium\nLow\nLow\nLow\nLow\nNote: N/A = not applicable.\nSource: Company files.\nExhibit 2 Wellington Brewery’s Sales Channels\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

For example, despite a favour-\nable working relationship with one major contract partner, \nWellington Brewery suffered a revenue shortfall when the \ncontract brewery’s production was unexpectedly reduced \nto 60 per cent of its 2019 forecast, as a Wellington Brewery \nsenior executive explained:\nWe were actually able to negotiate a really good rate. \nBecause they are so big, their beer is cheaper to make \nper litre than some of our other contracts in the past, and \nwe actually didn’t have to eat too much on the margin to \nget this huge sum of volume. The problem is, it leaves us \nvery much exposed. [If] they don’t get their forecast right,  \nit has huge implications for your financial forecasting, \nand that’s basically what happened.\nE-Commerce\nThe introduction of e-commerce as a new off-premises \nretail option was both beneficial and challenging for craft \nbreweries. Difficulties included regulated mandatory ship-\nping through Canada Post, standard shipping fees added to \norders (as opposed to being built into the selling price), the \ncost of packaging, and the labour-intensive processing of \nonline orders, which required different packaging and ship-\nping processes than the company’s usual format. Wellington \nBrewery initially chose to use Shopify Inc. (Shopify) as its \ne-commerce platform and engaged in benchmark research \nto generate ideas for the packaging, processing, and shipping \nof beer. The brewery was still looking for ways to improve \nthe end consumer’s online ordering experience when cus-\ntomers purchased Wellington Brewery products. For exam-\nple, through Shopify’s data analytics services, Wellington \nBrewery identified a recurring issue with dropped online \nshopping carts during the checkout phase. The company \nassessed the problem and addressed the issue by finding \na mutually beneficial revenue and costs solution involving \nshipping and processing fees, which was passed onto the \nconsumer.\nManual Processes and Insights  \nFrom Data\nWellington Brewery conducted various manual processes \nto support routine tasks and operations. The manual pro-\ncesses included tracking inventory on paper and then physi-\ncally verifying the amounts, forecasting sales using Microsoft \nExcel, recording licensee payments using Excel and telephone \ncalls, recording production amounts on paper and in Excel, \nand extracting sales data from the brewhouse point-of-sales \nsystem (TouchBistro) and inputting it into Excel. Welling-\nton Brewery deemed these manual processes suitable and \nefficient because new beer recipes were frequently created \nand modified, which was convenient for its current legacy \nsystems to create in-depth reports. Additionally, manual pro-\ncesses enabled interaction and promoted data analysis. How-\never, with the organization’s expansion and growth, auto-\nmated processes would inevitably become critical to improve \noverall efficiency.\nDavies was hoping to improve the manual processes \nby leveraging digital technology to increase efficiency, \nsave time, and produce additional data. In recent years, \nWellington Brewery had started using data for sales-based \ntracking and to identify comparable products for submis-\nsion to the LCBO. For example, the company was using \nthe DigThisData platform, a business software-as-a-service \napplication for alcohol vendors, to regularly monitor LCBO \nand TBS data. The software provided performance, compe-\ntition, and product data with a two-week delay. Wellington \nBrewery used the data to better position its products and \nimprove sales forecasting. Wellington Brewery also used \nEkos, an ERP system designed for the craft brewery industry \nthat involved complex implementation and time-consuming \nproject management. However, Davies was not sure the Ekos \nERP system was the most suitable choice for the company’s \nneeds.\nMarketing Data\nWellington Brewery collected marketing data through its own \nmonthly newsletter to customers, analytic data provided by \nthe Shopify platform, and Google Analytics. The company’s \nmarketing department also remained abreast of new trends \nby monitoring secondary research data such as Beer Canada \nreports, US market reports, international trends, and relevant \nsocial media activity. The objective was to continue expand-\ning strategically across the province and build the brand’s \nreputation. Monthly campaign budgets were determined on \nan ad hoc basis, depending on current needs. Davies hoped \nto find creative ways to communicate Wellington Brewery’s \nhistory and value proposition across the province, without \nsacrificing its strong local presence.\nConclusion\nWellington Brewery’s business strategy was fluid. The com-\npany was proactive in assessing risk and in finding ways to \nimprove cash flow. The major recent expansion had been \nsuccessful, but it had required Wellington Brewery to incur \nconsiderable costs. The highest priority at this point was to \nrecuperate those investment expenses. Davies was prepared \nto use all available information to devise a strategic path for-\nward for his company.\nFor the development of this case, the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Bob & Raye Briscoe Centre in Business Ownership Studies, John Molson \nSchool of Business, Concordia University.

Schwartz had been put on the \nboard after SoftBank had invested $4.4 billion in the com-\npany in 2017. Investors had been enamored with WeWork, a \nmulti-billion-dollar “unicorn” apparently revolutionizing the \ncollaborative office space market. The company was part tech \ncompany, part real estate play, and even part cult, some said.2 \nSchwartz had been feeling uneasy about certain things related to \nWeWork’s strategic direction for a while, but on this day, he knew \nhe needed to speak up. Since the IPO prospectus had been filed \na month earlier, in August, investors had griped about transpar-\nency, governance, and especially disclosures around flamboyant \nCEO Adam Neumann, the supposed cult leader of WeWork.\nThe company spent money like crazy, and Neumann \nseemed unfocused and slightly erratic. He also had a habit \nof overpromising. Schwartz knew that to take the company \npublic the oversight of the company had to improve. The \nboard had to evolve. In the past, he hadn’t spoken out, and \nthings had seemingly worked out quite well for WeWork’s \ninvestors. Just nine months earlier, a financing round had \nvalued the company at $47 billion. But the public market dis-\nagreed. The reported IPO valuation was between $8 billion \nand $10 billion—a number far less than what the company \nhad raised since 2010 from investors like Masayoshi Son, \nwhose SoftBank had invested $10 billion in the company.\nSchwartz knew his performance before the board that day \nneeded to be a balancing act. On the one hand, he didn’t want to \ndismantle what had been successful. WeWork had been known \nas America’s most valuable start-up just a few months earlier. But \non the other hand, fiscal discipline, lapses in governance over-\nsight, and perhaps even fraud needed to be plainly discussed. And \nwhat about the charismatic young CEO? Was Neumann ready \nto lead a public company? And most pressing—could WeWork \ndo an IPO at all? The company needed money. Schwartz knew \nthat the time to offer proper board-level oversight had come. \nThe company’s survival depended on it. But what should he say? \nSchwartz rose to speak to the six other board members, includ-\ning Neumann. “I’ve stayed silent too long,” he began.\nWeWork’s Early Days\nThe company had started innocently enough. Neumann and \nhis friend Miguel McKelvey first gained success after the Great \nRecession by starting a small property leasing business in \nBrooklyn. In 2010, they opened an office in SoHo and a grander \nvision began to take shape. The founders created a collabora-\ntive coworking space that could be leased to entrepreneurs  \non a short-term basis. WeWork offices were beautifully designed \nand furnished with a simple yet elevated aesthetic, each  \ntailored to its particular location.3 The spaces offered an array \nof shared desks, furnished private offices, and meeting rooms \nthat could be rented on a flexible basis (down to the minute,  \nby the day, or for months at a time) without the need for a long-\nterm lease, and featured technological infrastructure such as \nhigh-speed Wi-Fi and access to printers and office supplies. \nWeWork spaces also offered extensive amenities to foster col-\nlaboration and community, with complimentary refreshments \nin fully stocked kitchens, stylish common areas and lounges, \nand professional and social events such as happy hours and \nlunch-and-learns.4 Some locations featured espresso bars with \nbaristas, screening rooms, golf simulators, swimming pools, and \nwellness clubs.5 The company described its business model as \n“space-as-a-service” and sought to take advantage of growth in \nglobalization, urbanization, independent work, and the sharing \neconomy.6 WeWork started by catering to freelancers, start-ups, \nand small businesses in New York and San Francisco, and then \nexpanded across the United States and internationally, eventu-\nally adding enterprise clients and memberships that allowed \naccess to any location in WeWork’s growing network of spaces.\nNeumann showed his skill at fundraising early on. He \nspoke to investors enthusiastically about the changing work-\nforce and about how his “We”-branded business would offer \noffice rentals, housing, banking, and business services. Office \nrentals weren’t a particularly new idea—companies like Regus \nhad been offering business lounges, conferencing facilities, \nand shared office space since 1989. But Neumann captivated \ninvestors, customers, and employees with his enthusiastic \noptimism. He offered sermons about community and mis-\nsion. Much later, in the company’s IPO document, he wrote, \n“Our mission is to elevate the world’s consciousness.” Every-\none ate it up, including Silicon Valley.\nIn 2012, Neumann caught the attention of a partner at \nfamed venture capital (VC) firm Benchmark Capital. They \ndidn’t love the business, but they loved Neumann. And they \nwere impressed by the business model of leasing long term \nand charging higher short-term rates to tenants. Early-stage \ntech investors used to investing in years of negative cash flow \nwere heartened that WeWork promised the ability to quickly \nThis public-sourced case was prepared by J. Yo-Jud Cheng, Assistant Professor of Business Administration, and Stephen E.

Soon, the money began to flow. 2011 to 2014 \nfeatured a flurry of deals at escalating valuations. DAG Ven-\ntures was first to invest $1 million. MassMutual, Benchmark, \nand Fidelity invested at an $80 million valuation. JPMorgan \nChase & Co. (JPMorgan), Harvard, and others invested at a \nvaluation of $1.3 billion. T. Rowe Price invested at $4.6 bil-\nlion. Then Fidelity contributed to another round of funding \nat $9.8 billion. One venture capitalist commented about Neu-\nmann, “He was the most charismatic pitchman I ever saw.”7\nNeumann was known to be a little bit crazy, but crazy was \nalmost applauded by investors. In one instance in 2015, Neu-\nmann invited John Zhao to a party while Zhao’s China-based \nHony Capital Ltd. was considering investing in a round that \nwould push WeWork’s valuation over $16 billion. On the roof-\ntop of the 27-story Wall St. building, Neumann led a round \nof tequila shots and then picked up a fire extinguisher and \nsprayed everyone (including Zhao) with white foam. Did the \nwild behavior scuttle the deal? Hardly. The deal closed and \nZhao joined WeWork’s board in 2016. Later Zhao’s son got a \njob at WeWork. While all investors believed in the vision and \noptimism of Neumann, none committed more than SoftBank \nand its leader, Masayoshi Son.\nNeumann Meets Masayoshi Son\nSoftBank was originally founded in 1981 by 24-year-old Son \nas a software distributor. When SoftBank went public in \n1994 with a valuation of $3 billion, it was Japan’s largest pub-\nlisher of computer and technology magazines and producer \nof trade shows. Over the years, SoftBank became a holding \ncompany and began to make investments. The most success-\nful investment was $20 million placed into Jack Ma’s Alibaba \nin 2000, which grew to $60 billion when Alibaba went public \nin 2014. Son had decided to invest in Ma within minutes of \nmeeting him because of the “sparkles in his eyes.” In 2017, \nSon launched the massive $100 billion Vision Fund to make \ntech, energy, and financial investments. Nearly half the cap-\nital in the Vision Fund came from Mohammad bin Salman, \nthe crown prince of Saudi Arabia, buttressed by money from \nhigh-profile backers such as Apple, Qualcomm, UAE-based \nMubadala Investment Company, Saudi Arabia’s PID public \nfund, Foxconn, and Foxconn-owned Sharp.8\nIt was at a January 2016 investor event called Startup India \nwhere Son first saw Neumann speak onstage. This was the \nsame year that Ma and his wife Cathy invested approximately \n$25 million in WeWork. WeWork had a $12 billion valuation \nat the time, but fewer than 75 locations, none of which were \nin India. On stage, Neumann said at one point, “I’m surprised \n[by] the amount of talk I heard about valuation and raising \nmoney and bubbles and building big companies. That is not \nthe goal. The goal is finding something that you truly love. \nMake sure it has intention behind it. Make sure it’s going \nto make the world a better place.” That evening, Neumann \njoined Son for dinner.\nSon initially played coy and passed on several funding \nrounds, but in December 2016, Son asked for a tour of WeWork’s \nNew York headquarters. When Son arrived, he told Neumann \nthat he only had 12 minutes. Neumann raced to show what he \ncould and then Son asked Neumann to accompany him in his \ncar so they could talk. Son took out an iPad and wrote out the \nterms for a $4.4 billion investment in WeWork. He drew two \nlines at the bottom, signed one, then asked the 37-year-old \nNeumann to sign the other. Later Neumann recalled, “When \nMasa chose to invest in me for the first time, he only met me \nfor 28 minutes.”9 Son’s investment was announced in August \n2017. The goal was to accelerate WeWork’s growth; to grow as \nquickly as possible. As fast as Alibaba.\nWith pressure from Son, Neumann doubled his growth \nplans, straining the bounds of the organization. Opening a \nnew location involved a complicated set of steps: negotiat-\ning a lease, getting permits, designing the space, constructing \nthe project, tailoring the layout, marketing to the individual \nmarket, and finding tenants. In the frenzy to grow, mistakes \nwere made. When his lieutenants urged Neumann to slow \ndown, he berated them as “B players” and stripped their \njob titles. Neumann did not want to let down Son, who had \nbecome a mentor and friend. “Masa is a Jedi,” commented \nNeumann, “and as a Jedi, he has a lot of superpowers.”10\nGrowth Forever\nBy 2018, WeWork had become New York’s largest private \nlandlord.11 WeWork was opening a new location practically \nevery day and adding hundreds of employees each month, \ncompensated partially in stock (see Exhibit 1 for WeWork’s \nlocations over time).12 Son told Neumann not to be proud \nof WeWork’s lean sales staff, but to aim to have 10,000 sales-\npeople (when the entire company had fewer than 10,000 \nemployees). Once SoftBank invested, it seemed like no other \ninvestors were needed. Son cheered the growth despite some \nmisgivings from his internal SoftBank analysts, who hadn’t \neven wanted to invest in a real estate play in the first place. \n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\nQ2 2019\nLocations\n2\n7\n23\n111\n425\n528\nCities\n1\n3\n8\n34\n100\n111\nMemberships\n450\n4,000\n15,000\n87,000\n401,000\n527,000\nData sources: The We Company SEC Form S-1, 2019, https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1533523/ 000119312519220499/d781982ds1.htm; “WeWork: Deal History,” PitchBook, \nhttps://my.pitchbook.com/profile/62181-28/company/profile#deal-history/118473-40T (both accessed Feb. 22, 2021).\nExhibit 1 WeWork Locations, Cities, and Memberships\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

Not all the investments seemed synergistic. \nWeWork bought event-planning site Meetup.com, search-en-\ngine-optimization company Conductor, and the Flatiron \nAcademy coding school. After surfing with big-wave legend \nLaird Hamilton in Hawaii, Neumann decided to use com-\npany funds to invest $32 million in Laird Superfood. Despite \nmembers’ questions around the disparate acquisition strat-\negy, the board approved expenditures of more than $500 mil-\nlion in two years on tech-related companies. Neumann began \nto expand the vision for WeWork still further, reimagining \neducation, fitness, social gatherings, sports, and leisure. He \nenvisioned verticals WeWork, WeLive, WeLove, WeCongre-\ngate, WePlay, and WeGrow.\nThe company’s growth was staggering. For the first seven \nyears, the company doubled revenues annually. The fund-\nraising was staggering too. It took a lot of money to fund that \nkind of growth. Since its founding, WeWork had raised $10.7 \nbillion in nine separate funding rounds (Exhibit 2).13 But \nquestions began to arise for those paying attention. Neumann \nhad a habit of overpromising and underdelivering—or worse. \nA fall 2014 investor pitch he made showed a projection of a \n$2.4 million operating profit for the year. But at year-end, just \nthree months later, the company notched an operating loss of \n$88 million on $74 million of revenue. In 2015, Neumann told \nthe Wall Street Journal that WeWork was profitable and didn’t \nneed additional funding pre-IPO. That year, the company \nmade $187 million in revenue but lost $233 million. By the \ntime of the fall 2019 board meeting, WeWork had had only \none profitable year in its history, when it made $1.7 million \nin 2012 (see Exhibit 3 for WeWork’s financial performance).\nSome investors wondered about WeWork’s path to prof-\nitability. Was there one? When Benchmark first invested, \nBruce Dunlevie, the VC firm’s representative on WeWork’s \nboard, admitted to a partner that he wasn’t sure the com-\npany would ever become profitable.14 The business model was \nsimple enough. Rent office space, divide it up, and sublease \nat a higher per-unit cost. For years, WeWork had bled cash \nchasing growth, but there were questions about whether the \nmodel could be profitable even at a single location.15 It was \nalso a model that could be copied. And it was. Big landlords \nbegan to launch their own coworking efforts around the \nworld.16 Other coworking entrepreneurs saw WeWork enter-\ning markets and opened their own location just a few blocks \naway, then undercut WeWork on price.17 In 2017, China’s \nUrWork raised $58 million from Alibaba’s Ant Financial unit \nand other investors, essentially copying WeWork’s model.18 \nWhat did that mean for future pricing power? Would there be \nenough demand to keep occupancy rates high? Did WeWork \nhave a sustainable competitive advantage?\nNeumann Tightens His Grip\nNeumann was becoming fabulously wealthy on paper  \n($3 billion by 2015), but raising money diluted the founders’ \nfinancial ownership. It also diluted control. Neumann, who \nhad cultivated an image of new-age enlightened leader, did \nnot always seem to practice what he preached. In one meet-\ning, an executive recalled that Neumann spoke openly about \nhis goal to make WeWork into a “monopoly.”19 When it was \nmentioned that monopolies were illegal and implied unfair \nbusiness practices, Neumann shrugged and said in the future \nhe’d call it something else. When it came to company control, \nNeumann’s worst impulses were on display.\nDate\nRound\nKey Investor(s)\nAmount\nPre-Money\nValuation\n10/25/11\nFirst VC\nDAG Ventures\n$1\nN/A\n7/1/12\nSeries A\nMassMutual, Benchmark, Fidelity\n$17\n$80\n5/29/13\nSeries B\nUndisclosed\n$40\n$400\n2/1/14\nSeries C\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., Harvard, Benchmark, Mort Zuckerman\n$150\n$1,343\n12/16/14\nSeries D\nT.

Rowe Price invested in two of WeWork’s funding \nrounds, Neumann restructured the stock so that his shares \nhad 10 times the voting control of normal shares, giving him \nlong-term voting control. In the same deal, an entity he con-\ntrolled sold $40 million of stock, and he sold an additional \n$80 million in 2015.\nWhile most went along with these changes, Benchmark’s \nDunlevie resisted temporarily, warning Neumann that abso-\nlute power corrupts absolutely. Early-stage investors did not \nlike seeing the founder pull money out before they did in \nan IPO, and Dunlevie had a history of walking away from \na guaranteed payday over a principle (in a partnership with \nToys“R”Us earlier in his Benchmark career, Dunlevie walked \naway from a big potential payout after middle management \nsubverted his ideas). Later, Dunlevie’s daughter was hired \nby WeWork. By 2017, Benchmark partners were concerned \nenough by Neumann’s actions that they flew to see him in \nManhattan. Dunlevie, despite his pushback, was more def-\nerential to Neumann than other Benchmark partners who \nworried that Neumann was acting like Travis Kalanick, the \nwild CEO of Uber (another Benchmark investment), and \nneeded to be reined in. They voiced their concerns to Neu-\nmann, but nothing meaningful changed. T. Rowe Price also \nbecame alarmed. “We saw the valuation rise and the corporate \ngovernance erode,” said co-head of global equity at T. Rowe \nPrice. When SoftBank invested, T. Rowe Price sold as much \nof its investment as possible to Son’s firm.\nA Captive Board\nLike most other venture-backed private companies, WeWork’s \nboard started small and then grew over time with the addition \nof investors. It was typical for outside investors to negotiate \na board seat as a contingency in the term sheet for an invest-\nment (alternatively, some investors negotiated for a seat as a \nboard observer who could participate in board discussions \nbut did not have formal voting rights). Over time, the board \nadded VC representatives such as Benchmark’s Dunlevie and \nHony Capital’s Zhao. Later, Son appointed two top SoftBank \nlieutenants—SoftBank vice chair Ron Fisher and Schwartz, \na former Goldman Sachs partner—to sit on the board. Like \npublic company directors, directors of private companies \nwere also bound by fiduciary duties. For directors who also \nrepresented their VC firms, these duties could at times create \nconflicts because of their obligations both to the company in \nwhich they invested and to their VC fund.\nDirectors of private companies were often more deeply \ninvolved than public company directors in day-to-day com-\npany operations. For several years, Schwartz was a regular \nin the WeWork office, working out of a small room near \nNeumann and other top executives.21 But Neumann’s voting \nYear Ended December 31,\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2018\n2019\nRevenue\n$436,099\n$886,004\n$1,821,751\n$763,771\n$1,535,420\nExpenses:\n   Location operating expenses\n$433,167\n$814,782\n$1,521,129\n$635,968\n$1,232,941\n   Other operating expenses\n—\n$1,677\n$106,788\n$42,024\n$81,189\n   Pre-opening location expenses\n$115,749\n$131,324\n$357,831\n$156,983\n$255,133\n   Sales and marketing expenses\n$43,428\n$143,424\n$378,729\n$139,889\n$320,046\n   Growth and new market development expenses\n$35,731\n$109,719\n$477,273\n$174,091\n$369,727\n   General and administrative expenses\n$115,346\n$454,020\n$357,486\n$155,257\n$389,910\n   Depreciation and amortization\n$88,952\n$162,892\n$313,514\n$137,418\n$255,924\n      Total expenses\n$832,373\n$1,817,838\n$3,512,750\n$1,441,630\n$2,904,870\nLoss from operations\n$(396,274)\n$(931,834)\n$(1,690,999)\n$(677,859)\n$(1,369,450)\nInterest and other income (expense), net\n$(33,400)\n$(7,387)\n$(237,270)\n$(46,406)\n$469,915\nPre-tax loss\n$(429,674)\n$(939,221)\n$(1,928,269)\n$(724,265)\n$(899,535)\nIncome tax benefit (provision)\n$(16)\n$5,727\n$850\n$1,373\n$(5,117)\nNet loss\n$(429,690)\n$(933,494)\n$(1,927,419)\n$(722,892)\n$(904,652)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n—\n$49,500\n$316,627\n$94,762\n$214,976\nNet loss attributable to WeWork Companies Inc.\n$(429,690)\n$(883,994)\n$(1,610,792)\n$(628,130)\n$(689,676)\nExhibit 3  Consolidated Results of Operations (amounts in thousands of US dollars)\nData source: The We Company SEC Form S-1, 2019, https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/ 1533523/000119312519220499/d781982ds1.htm; (accessed Feb. 22, 2021).\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

He had always favored hiring friends and family. \nHis wife Rebekah was hired as WeWork’s chief brand officer, \ndespite misgivings from the board. This meant that func-\ntionally, WeWork’s board operated more like an advisory \nboard than a typical corporate board with strong oversight. \nFor instance, the board signed off on Neumann’s use of $13 \nmillion of WeWork’s funds to invest in a company that made \nartificial wave pools,22 and let Neumann conduct an expen-\nsive renovation of its corporate headquarters, adding a sauna \nand ice bath in his office. Neumann paid three times the \nnormal price the company paid for renovations to get prime \nreal estate in San Francisco, cutting through the floor to make \nroom for a staircase and adding a fitness club.\nWhile Dunlevie had pushed back against some of Neu-\nmann’s most brazen moves, he never pushed too hard. One \nof Dunlevie’s colleagues at Benchmark scoffed at the idea that \nhe should have stepped down from the board, explaining that \nBenchmark had “invested when WeWork was worth, like, \neighty million dollars, and now it’s worth fifteen billion, and \nwe should walk away? Or, even worse, complain?”23\nNeumann regularly missed board meetings throughout \n2018, sending a delegate instead. At the meetings, directors \ndiscussed the pace of growth among other issues. A top \nWeWork executive who participated in board meetings said, \n“If you review the minutes of our board meetings, you would \nsee that never has there been a board vote that wasn’t unani-\nmous. There was never a budget plan, or a growth plan, that \nwasn’t approved unanimously. If board members had con-\ncerns, they never once officially said them.”24\nNeumann’s Leadership\nThe six-foot-five, long-haired Adam Neumann was charis-\nmatic, frenetic, and full of platitudes like, “If you are open-\nminded and you let the universe come in, you never know \nwhere things might go,”25 and “Success is not just making \nmoney. Success is happiness. Success is fulfillment; it’s the \nability to give.”26 Top employees were told to attend weekly ses-\nsions with a guru. Recreational drug use and sex among staff \nmembers at the headquarters was commonplace, and con-\ndoms routinely were found in stairwells. Neumann smoked \nmarijuana at the office.27 While many investors appreciated \nNeumann’s enlightened style of leadership, they seemed most \nimpressed by his track record of doubling WeWork’s revenues \nand its valuation every year.\nDuring the time WeWork was valued at $5 billion, Neu-\nmann had flown private. But in 2018, he wanted an upgrade. \nDespite board of director and investor concerns, Neumann \nused $63 million to purchase a brand-new Gulfstream \nG650ER that had 16 seats and two lavatories—one for the \ncrew. In more recent years, the board allowed Neumann to \npersonally buy stakes in buildings that he would then lease \nback to WeWork. Related party transactions like this were \nfrowned upon by Wall Street, and had to be plainly disclosed \nin SEC filings by publicly traded companies because of the \npossibility of a conflict of interest.\nEventually Schwartz, Dunlevie, and Langman pushed \nNeumann in board meetings to commit to a timeline for an \nIPO. Some of the board members reasoned that an IPO would \nbring public market oversight to a situation they had trouble \nreining in. But that same year, Son dangled a potential fur-\nther $20 billion investment, including the buyout of existing \ninvestors. Son wanted a majority stake in the company.\nPressure Builds for an IPO\nIn December 2018, SoftBank’s stock plunged—primarily due \nto market issues—and Son decided that the potential $20 bil-\nlion investment could only be $2 billion. Over breakfast in \nHawaii, Son and Neumann agreed that the new round would \nbe raised at a $47 billion valuation, with $1 billion used to buy \nshares from previous investors, allowing some on the board \nto sell. Executives and board members like Schwartz knew \nthe $6 billion on the balance sheet at the beginning of 2019 \nwouldn’t last. In January 2019, Neumann told CNBC that the \nnew funding from SoftBank (which brought its total invest-\nment in WeWork to $10 billion) was “above and beyond what \nwe need to fund the company for the next four to five years.” \nBut the math didn’t work. While he had always put off an IPO \ndue to the intrusive scrutiny of public market investors and \nanalysts, Neumann began to have a change of heart.\nInvestment banks acted as both enabler and seductress, \nwooed by the potential fees of a major IPO. JPMorgan and \nGoldman Sachs were both investors. Neumann referred to \nJPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon as his personal banker and \nhad a $500 million personal credit line from JPMorgan and \nother banks.28 Goldman Sachs bankers urged growth in \npitchbooks and showed a slide with WeWork’s path to a tril-\nlion-dollar market capitalization. Time and again, JPMorgan, \nDimon, and other bankers championed Neumann’s business \nmodel as they battled for the coveted IPO assignment that \ncould bring prestige and yield millions in fees.\nStock exchanges, lured by the cachet and revenues that \nwould come with a blockbuster public listing, also angled \nto get in on the action. With his listing decision on the \nline, Neumann invited the leaders of the New York Stock \nExchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ to one of his Hamptons \nhomes to solicit their support for one of his pet causes: envi-\nronmental sustainability. NYSE President Stacey Cunning-\nham offered to eliminate single-use plastic products in its \ncafeteria; NASDAQ CEO Adena Friedman offered to create a \nnew stock market index, the “We 50,” committed to sustain-\nability.29 Neumann went with NASDAQ.\nDue to the structure of VC funds, investors were moti-\nvated to grow and scale a company over a constrained \ntime period, with the end goal of exiting their investment \nthrough a sale or IPO.30 The potential windfall offered by an \nIPO generated a strong incentive to see the public offering \nthrough. Although the board (shown at the time of the IPO \nin Exhibit 4) noted weaknesses in the company’s operations \nand leadership, momentum for an IPO was growing, and \npressure was mounting to clear any obstacles that stood in \nthe way (directors’ stock holdings are shown in Exhibit 5).\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

He had been \ngranted substantial stock options that could only be exercised \nfollowing an IPO.31 Just that year, Pinterest ($12.7 billion val-\nuation), Zoom ($9.2 billion), CrowdStrike ($6.7 billion), and \nespecially Uber ($82.4 billion) had all raised large sums of \nmoney at significant valuations. Success seemed inevitable. \nExecutives and employees, paid heavily in equity, also saw \ndollar signs. No one wanted to stand in the way with a loom-\ning payday on the horizon.\nA Company on the Brink\nThe first bad sign to investors was the July roadshow meeting. \nNeumann spoke to analysts but did not give any real num-\nbers. He compared the company to Amazon with its nearly \n$1 trillion valuation, hoping the IPO value of $65 billion for \nWeWork would seem like a relative bargain. Meanwhile, a \nWall Street Journal article crowed about Neumann cashing out \nat least $700 million via sales and loans.32 Analysts wondered: \nIf the founder was selling, why should we invest? Then inves-\ntors learned that early investor Benchmark had not increased \nits initial investment in subsequent rounds, despite Bench-\nmark partner Dunlevie sitting on the WeWork board. What \ndid Benchmark see?\nIn the lead-up to a potential IPO, it was typical for boards \nto formalize governance policies and procedures as they \nprepared to comply with SEC and listing exchange require-\nments for public companies. Although newly public firms \nwere granted a transition period to meet certain governance \nrequirements following an IPO, many firms adopted these \nrequirements well in advance to instill confidence with pro-\nspective investors.\nOn August 14, 2019, WeWork filed its IPO prospectus \n(also referred to as the “S-1” or “registration statement”). This \nrepresented one of the major milestones in the path toward \nan eventual IPO, and was the first time the public would gain \naccess to details about the company’s business plan, opera-\ntions, and properties; audited financial statements; data on \ncurrent shareholders’ equity and executive compensation; \nand a list of independent directors. The reaction was swift \nand ugly. Analysts saw massive losses ($900 million in the \nfirst half of 2019) and $47 billion in lease obligations. They \nwondered why Neumann was to be paid $5.9 million in stock \nfor the rights to the word “we” in the rebranded We Company \nname.\nNeumann’s huge voting power also raised eyebrows. In \na public offering, companies could establish distinct classes \nof shares that conferred different voting rights. WeWork’s \noffering included Class A shares, which provided one vote \nper share, as well as Class B and Class C shares (nearly all \nowned or controlled by Neumann) that provided 20 votes \nper share. The Class C shares were created through a complex \nrestructuring that bestowed Neumann and other executives \nmore favorable tax treatment on future profits than for \nother shareholders. In effect, Neumann would control more \nthan 50% of the shareholder voting power, thus maintain-\ning the control he had amassed as the company scaled, and \nlimiting the ability of future shareholders to vote on issues \nsuch as director elections and the approval of mergers and \nacquisitions.33\nAlthough single-class share structures were most common \nin public offerings, dual-class structures were becoming \nincreasingly prevalent (used in 28% of IPOs in 2017 and 19% \nof IPOs in 2018),34 particularly among founder-led tech com-\npanies. Even so, the 20 votes per share afforded to Neumann \nfar exceeded the voting rights offered by most other firms’ \ndual-class shares. The concentration of voting power also \nallowed WeWork to qualify as a “controlled company” under \nNASDAQ rules, thus exempting it from requirements that \nmandated a majority of independent board directors and that \nthe audit and compensation committees be composed solely \nof independent directors.\nExternal observers questioned why it was written in the \nprospectus that Neumann’s wife Rebekah (who he called his \n“thought partner”) would be placed at the helm of a commit-\ntee with two board members to pick her husband’s successor \nshould something happen to him within 10 years of the IPO. \nKey executives only learned of this days before the prospectus \nwas released (see Exhibit 6 for excerpts from the prospec-\ntus). While there were no federal requirements in the United \nStates around board diversity for public companies, it was \ncommon for boards to add directors from underrepresented \ngroups as they prepared for an IPO (because the majority \nof start-up founders and VC investors were men, the boards \nof private, venture-backed firms typically had little gender \ndiversity).35 Pundits noted that the company boasted about \nits culture of inclusivity yet maintained an all-male board. \nThey also wondered whether Neumann was fit to lead a pub-\nlicly traded company. Although many founder-led companies \nlike Facebook and Google performed well after going pub-\nlic,36 leadership transitions were common: the founder was \nreplaced by a new CEO in nearly half (47%) of IPOs.37\nSaving the Sinking Ship\nBy the end of August, WeWork’s valuation was expected to be \nless than half the $47 billion used in SoftBank’s January financ-\ning. A few weeks later, WeWork’s board of directors gathered for \nwhat was sure to be a long meeting. Schwartz had the attention \nof the entire board because the numbers were clear. WeWork \nwould run out of money in a few months, the second week \nof November. Neumann seemed open to doing whatever was \nnecessary to save the company. What needed to be done to sal-\nvage the IPO and regain the trust of investors? Schwartz rose to \nspeak. There were many issues he wanted to address.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.

From the day he co-founded WeWork, Adam has set the Company’s vision, strategic direction and execution priorities. \nAdam is a unique leader who has proven he can simultaneously wear the hats of visionary, operator and innovator, while \nthriving as a community and culture creator. Given his deep involvement in all aspects of the growth of our company, Adam’s \npersonal dealings have evolved across a number of direct and indirect transactions and relationships with the Company. As \nwe make the transition to a public company, we aim to provide clarity and transparency on the history of these relationships \nand transactions, as well as the background to the strategic governance decisions that have been made by Adam and the \nCompany. …\nVoting Controls\nAdam controls a majority of the Company’s voting power, principally as a result of his beneficial ownership of our high-vote \nstock. Since our high-vote stock carries twenty votes per share, Adam will have the ability to control the outcome of mat-\nters submitted to the Company’s stockholders for approval, including the election of the Company’s directors. As a found-\ner-led company, we believe that this voting structure aligns our interests in creating shareholder value. Adam is, however, \ncommitted to relinquishing control at a time when he no longer maintains a significant economic interest in The We Company \nand the share ownership of Adam and certain of his permitted transferees represents less than 5% of the aggregate number of \nthen-outstanding shares of our capital stock, at which time all of the outstanding high-vote stock would convert to having one \nvote per share.\nSuccession Planning\nAs part of our transition to a public company, our board of directors has spent significant time planning for the transition from \na privately controlled company to a public company and put considerable thought into succession planning. In particular, in \nconnection with this offering we are taking measures to provide clarity as to how unexpected transitions in our leadership \nmight occur.\nIn the event that Adam is permanently disabled or deceased during the ten-year period commencing upon the completion \nof this offering, a committee will be formed for the sole purpose of selecting a new Chief Executive Officer. The composition of \nthis committee will be as follows:\n \n●\nBruce Dunlevie and Steven Langman, who are currently members of our board of directors and members of our compensa-\ntion and nominating committee, to the extent they are then serving as our directors, will serve on this selection committee \nwith Rebekah Neumann (with the size of the committee fixed at two or three, as applicable); and\n \n●\nif neither Bruce nor Steven is then serving as one of our directors, Rebekah will choose one or two board members who are \nserving at the time to serve on this selection committee with Rebekah.\nPersonal Loans\nAdam currently has a line of credit of up to $500 million with UBS AG, Stamford Branch, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Credit \nSuisse AG, New York Branch, of which approximately $380 million principal amount was outstanding as of July 31, 2019. The \nline of credit is secured by a pledge of approximately shares of our Class B common stock beneficially owned by Adam.

If one part of the system is \nnot functioning properly, it can hold back creation of value in the \nentire system.\nvertical acquisition refers to a firm acquiring a supplier or \ndistributor of one or more of its products.\nVertical integration exists when a company produces its own \ninputs (backward integration) or owns its own source of output \ndistribution (forward integration).\nVision is a picture of what the firm wants to be and, in broad \nterms, what it wants to ultimately achieve.\nW \nThe worldwide geographic area structure emphasizes national \ninterests and facilitates the firm’s efforts to satisfy local differences.\nIn the worldwide product divisional structure, decision-making \nauthority is centralized in the worldwide division headquarters to \ncoordinate and integrate decisions and actions among divisional \nbusiness units.\nCopyright 2024 Cengage Learning.
