{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":2,"chapter_title":"SHIFT SCOPE; ROTATE","summary":"In this chapter, the author emphasizes the importance of shifting scope between teams rather than moving personnel. This method allows teams to optimize their workload without disrupting system behavior or incurring re-gelling costs. By incrementally assigning responsibilities to teams with slack, organizations can preserve their mental models while effectively managing throughput. Additionally, rotating individuals into areas that need assistance can enhance team cohesion and provide insights into team capacity. Overall, these strategies offer innovative approaches to optimizing organizational design.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A surreal office environment where teams are collaborating and shifting tasks fluidly, bathed in warm golden hour light with a touch of mist.
