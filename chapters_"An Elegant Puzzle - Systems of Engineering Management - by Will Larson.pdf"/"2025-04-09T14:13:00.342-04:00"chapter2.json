{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":2,"chapter_title":"VELOCITY","summary":"In this chapter, Will Larson articulates the importance of effectively communicating constraints related to project velocity within teams. Understanding and explaining why certain tasks take longer than expected is crucial for setting realistic expectations. By utilizing tools like a kanban board, teams can visualize their workflows and identify bottlenecks. Focusing on core constraints rather than allowing scattered suggestions leads to meaningful improvements. The chapter emphasizes the need to ground discussions in data, particularly regarding project management metrics, to facilitate constructive conversations around capacity and workload.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A dreamlike depiction of a team collaborating around a kanban board, enveloped in warm vintage tones, with soft atmospheric lighting.
