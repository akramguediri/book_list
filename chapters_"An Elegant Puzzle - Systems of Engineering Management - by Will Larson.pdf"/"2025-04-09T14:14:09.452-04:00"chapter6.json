Managers are encouraged to navigate these challenges proactively to foster a productive environment.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Generate a dreamy cinematic landscape depicting a diverse group of employees collaborating in a harmonious work environment, with warm vintage tones, soft atmospheric lighting, and a sense of calm and productivity.
