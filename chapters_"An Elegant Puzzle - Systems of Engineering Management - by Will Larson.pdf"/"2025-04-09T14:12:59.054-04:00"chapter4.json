{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":4,"chapter_title":"WORK THE POLICY","summary":"In this chapter, we explore the importance of focusing on policy rather than exceptions in organizational management. When exceptions arise due to the constraints of existing policies, they should be documented and treated as valuable insights for policy revisions. By embracing escalations as test cases, organizations can ensure a consistent and fair environment for all. It is crucial to set a future date for policy evaluations to avoid premature modifications based on concerns. Ultimately, this approach fosters trust and efficiency, allowing teams to operate smoothly while continuously improving policies.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A dreamlike scene capturing the essence of policy evolution, with a vintage aesthetic reminiscent of classical art.
