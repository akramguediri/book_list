{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":3,"chapter_title":"DEFINING TEAMS AND GROUPS","summary":"In this chapter, we explore the crucial elements of defining teams and groups within an engineering organization. Understanding the appropriate manager-to-engineer ratio is essential, as it hinges on the specific roles expected of engineering managers. Setting a target number of engineers per manager, typically between six to eight, allows for effective oversight and support. Additionally, the chapter offers practical guidance on structuring the organization, considering team sizes, mission statements, and proximity to enhance collaboration. These foundational steps ensure a cohesive and well-functioning engineering team dynamic.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Create a dreamlike scene that embodies the essence of teamwork and collaboration, incorporating soft atmospheric lighting with warm vintage tones. The composition should evoke the elegance of classical art, highlighting interconnected groups of engineers working harmoniously, surrounded by natural settings bathed in golden hour light. Integrate elements of proximity and communication, such as open spaces and team interactions, with painterly textures resembling oil on canvas. Use deep greens, warm beiges, and soft browns to enhance the emotional resonance of collaboration.","style":"elegant and collaborative","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#EDE4D9","#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F"],"font_primary":"BluuNext-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Regular.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Understanding Manager-to-Engineer Ratios","section_body":"A well-defined manager-to-engineer ratio is fundamental to an effective engineering organization.
