This balance ensures adequate support without overwhelming the manager. It's essential for fostering engagement and successful project outcomes.","quote":"Managers should support six to eight engineers for active coaching and alignment."},{"id":4,"section_title":"The Role of Managers For Smaller Teams","section_body":"When managing fewer than four engineers, managers often take on too many technical responsibilities. This limits their opportunity for growth as leaders. Creating a supportive environment for increased focus on management skills is beneficial.","quote":"Managers of fewer than four engineers risk becoming TLMs with limited career advancement."},{"id":5,"section_title":"Coaching Dynamics for Larger Teams","section_body":"For teams larger than eight engineers, managers often shift to coaching roles, focusing less on direct involvement. Maintaining team dynamics and engagement becomes pivotal to prevent isolation among team members.","quote":"Managers of more than nine engineers act as coaches and safety nets, which is often unsustainable."},{"id":6,"section_title":"On-Call Rotation Considerations","section_body":"An effective on-call rotation requires approximately eight engineers to ensure sufficient coverage. This sizing consideration helps in maintaining team well-being and performance during critical support needs.","quote":"Two-tier 24/7 support requires eight engineers for effective coverage."},{"id":7,"section_title":"Challenges with Small Teams","section_body":"Teams composed of fewer than four members often face significant challenges. They tend to be fragile and may struggle to maintain innovation amidst technical debt. Understanding these limitations is crucial for effective management.","quote":"Small teams are not teams; they are too fragile to maintain a balance of innovation and maintenance."},{"id":8,"section_title":"Integrating Innovation with Maintenance","section_body":"Historically, new teams were often established separately for innovation, but integrating these efforts within existing teams enhances morale.
