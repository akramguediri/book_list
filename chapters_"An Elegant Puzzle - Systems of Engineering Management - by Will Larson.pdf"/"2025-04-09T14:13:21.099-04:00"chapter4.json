{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":4,"chapter_title":"CLOSE OUT, SOLVE, OR DELEGATE","summary":"Transitioning into a managerial role often brings about feelings of anxiety, especially when one loses touch with previous sources of fulfillment. The challenge becomes managing problems without resorting to overworking, as traditional habits may no longer serve effectively. To tackle this, a practical tool is proposed: for each problem, choose to either close out, solve, or delegate. This method encourages proactive decision-making, helping to prevent previous tasks from resurfacing. By implementing this framework, managers can navigate their responsibilities more efficiently and regain a sense of control.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"An ethereal office space bathed in golden hour light, adorned with soft shadows that reflect a sense of warmth and calm.
