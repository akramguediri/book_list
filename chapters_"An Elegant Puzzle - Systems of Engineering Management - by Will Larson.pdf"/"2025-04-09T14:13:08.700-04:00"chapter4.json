{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"management","chapter_id":4,"chapter_title":"DO THE HARD THING NOW","summary":"This chapter emphasizes the importance of confronting difficult challenges head-on in engineering management. It posits that while relationships are critical in problem-solving, often fundamental technical issues arise that require immediate attention. The author suggests viewing processes as tools that should be flexible and tailored to the team rather than rigid constructs. Ultimately, the focus should shift from merely finding new processes to seriously tackling the core issues at hand. By doing so, teams can foster a more collaborative and effective working environment.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"In a dreamlike cinematic style, depict a scene of a team confronting a challenging problem together in warm vintage tones with soft atmospheric lighting. The image should evoke a sense of camaraderie and resilience, resembling a moment of clarity amidst confusion. Incorporate golden hour glow and misty air, showcasing chiaroscuro lighting with painterly textures. Integrate colors such as #D2BBA0, #B8C3A8, and #3B3A3F to enhance the emotional resonance of the scene.","style":"inspirational and collaborative","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":10,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#B8C3A8","#3B3A3F"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Black.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":5,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Embrace Difficult Challenges Head-On","section_body":"Engineering management often demands confronting tough situations that cannot be guided by simple rules.
