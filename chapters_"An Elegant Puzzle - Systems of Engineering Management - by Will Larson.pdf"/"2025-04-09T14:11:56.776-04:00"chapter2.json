{"book_name":"An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management - by Will Larson.pdf","genre":"engineering management","chapter_id":2,"chapter_title":"SYSTEMS SURVIVE ONE MAGNITUDE OF GROWTH","summary":"This chapter delves into the relationship between engineering headcount and system productivity. As teams grow, their effectiveness can diminish due to the increasing on-call responsibilities and specialized systems needed to manage production issues. The author highlights that most systems are only equipped to handle one to two orders of magnitude of growth, which necessitates frequent re-implementations. This scaling challenge is exacerbated by the cardinality of supported systems increasing over time, stressing the importance of strategic design to avoid resource contention. Ultimately, poor migration practices can turn system rewrites into major productivity hindrances.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Visualize a surreal scene where systems are depicted as intricate, elegant machinery against a backdrop of soft, golden hour light. Integrate elements of growth like branching trees subtly intertwined with gears and cogs, symbolizing the balance of natural growth and engineering systems. Use warm vintage hues to evoke nostalgia and sophistication, incorporating deep green, soft beige, and rusty orange shades from the palette. The atmosphere should feel immersive and dreamlike, capturing both the beauty and complexity of scaling systems in technology.","style":"surreal yet naturalistic with a focus on vintage elegance","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":10,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#EDE4D9","#4B2E2B"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"EBGaramond12-Regular.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Cost of Growth in Engineering Teams","section_body":"As companies expand their engineering teams, challenges arise in managing on-call responsibilities.
