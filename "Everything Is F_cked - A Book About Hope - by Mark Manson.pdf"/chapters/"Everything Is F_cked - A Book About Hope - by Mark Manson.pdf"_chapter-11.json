{"book_name":"Everything Is F_cked - A Book About Hope - by Mark Manson.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":6,"chapter_title":"THE FORMULA OF HUMANITY","summary":"In this chapter, Mark Manson explores the philosophical insights of Immanuel Kant, particularly his 'Formula of Humanity' which emphasizes treating humanity as an end in itself, rather than a means to an end. Manson argues that many individuals fail to grow beyond adolescent values, which focus on pleasure and transactional relationships. He asserts that true adulthood involves embracing virtues such as honesty, love, and principles that transcend self-interest. The chapter also examines the consequences of failing to develop mature values and how this affects personal relationships and broader societal structures, positing that a lack of maturity manifests in contemporary political extremism.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A thoughtful and contemplative philosopher in a grand library, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, earthy beige, deep burgundy, soft cream, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"philosophical reflection","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":10,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#BA8B6A","#3B3A3F"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"EBGaramond12-Regular.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Kant’s Methodical Life","section_body":"Immanuel Kant lived a remarkably regimented life, waking up at five every morning to write for three hours. His consistent habits made him both an efficiency model and the subject of local jokes.

In this stage, actions are often motivated by the desire to avoid pain and maximize pleasure rather than principled convictions. This mindset hampers genuine relationships and personal growth.","quote":"An adolescent’s decisions are often a complex bargaining game, rooted in self-interest and fear."},{"id":4,"section_title":"True Adulthood","section_body":"Adulthood is not merely about age but about the intent behind actions.
