{"book_name":"Atomic Habits.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":11,"chapter_title":"WALK SLOWLY, BUT NEVER BACKWARD","summary":"In this chapter, the author illustrates the critical difference between being in motion and taking action. Through an engaging example of a photography class, he highlights how getting results comes from consistent practice rather than theoretical planning. By emphasizing the importance of repetition, he explains how habits form and solidify in our brains, transitioning from effortful tasks to automatic behaviors. Establishing a new habit is more about the frequency of action than the amount of time spent; regular practice leads to mastery. This chapter ultimately encourages readers to stop procrastinating through planning and start taking actionable steps towards their goals.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A photography classroom scene where students engage in creating their work, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, Warm Sand, Dusty Rose, Deep Forest Green, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"classical and inspirational","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#BA8B6A","#4B2E2B"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-Regular.otf","text_color":"#4B2E2B","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Power of Quantity Over Quality","section_body":"In a captivating classroom experiment, students are divided into two groups: those who focus on quantity and those on quality.
