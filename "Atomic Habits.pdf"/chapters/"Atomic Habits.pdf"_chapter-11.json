{"book_name":"Atomic Habits.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":4,"chapter_title":"THE MAN WHO DIDN’T LOOK RIGHT","summary":"In this chapter, we explore the power of intuition and the brain's ability to predict outcomes based on environmental cues. Through various examples, such as a paramedic noticing signs of a heart attack and military analysts distinguishing between threats, we see how experiences shape unconscious recognition. The chapter emphasizes that as habits form, they often operate on autopilot, making them difficult to recognize and change without conscious awareness. Key strategies like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are introduced to help increase self-awareness of our habits. Recognizing our behaviors is the first step toward meaningful change.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A paramedic observing subtle signs of distress, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, light beige, soft taupe, muted brown, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"inspirational and reflective","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#EDE4D9","#D2BBA0"],"font_primary":"BluuNext-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Understanding Intuition in Emergencies","section_body":"A paramedic's intuition can save lives by recognizing signs that others may overlook.
