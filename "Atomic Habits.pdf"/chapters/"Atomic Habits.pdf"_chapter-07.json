{"book_name":"Atomic Habits.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":1,"chapter_title":"THE SURPRISING POWER OF ATOMIC HABITS","summary":"In this chapter, we learn about the profound impact of small improvements through the story of British Cycling, which transitioned from mediocrity to champions under Dave Brailsford's guidance. By focusing on the aggregation of marginal gains, tiny enhancements in various facets led to remarkable results, demonstrating that success is the sum of small, consistent habits. The author emphasizes that habits are like compound interest in self-improvement; the effects of daily actions progressively manifest over time. This chapter teaches us to value and commit to small changes for long-term success, illustrating that achieving significant results doesn't require drastic measures, but rather consistent, incremental improvements.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A dynamic cycling team training hard and collaborating for progress, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, vibrant green, soft beige, deep burgundy, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"inspirational and motivational","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#9B643D"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"Quicksand-SemiBold.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"British Cycling's Transformation","section_body":"In 2003, British Cycling had been performing poorly for nearly a century.
