{"book_name":"The Psychology of Money Timeless Lessons on Wealth Greed and Happiness By Morgan Housel-pdfread.net.pdf","genre":"non-fiction","chapter_id":7,"chapter_title":"FREEDOM","summary":"In this chapter, the concept of freedom takes center stage as the ultimate form of wealth. True happiness stems from the ability to control one's life, emphasizing that it's not merely about accumulating money, but about gaining the autonomy to live authentically. Research by Angus Campbell reveals that autonomy is a key predictor of wellbeing, surpassing traditional measures of success.
