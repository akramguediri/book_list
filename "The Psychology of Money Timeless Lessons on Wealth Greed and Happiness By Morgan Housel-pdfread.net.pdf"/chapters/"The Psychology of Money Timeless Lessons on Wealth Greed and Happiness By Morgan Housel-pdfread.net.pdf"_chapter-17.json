{"book_name":"The Psychology of Money Timeless Lessons on Wealth Greed and Happiness By Morgan Housel-pdfread.net.pdf","genre":"finance","chapter_id":15,"chapter_title":"NOTHING’S FREE","summary":"In 'Nothing's Free,' Morgan Housel illustrates that everything in life, particularly financial success, has a price, often obscured until it is payable. He uses General Electric's downfall as a case study to demonstrate the often invisible challenges leaders face, which can lead to significant failures. Tools that aim to avoid volatility in investing often backfire, causing investors to end up paying more. The chapter underscores that viewing market volatility as a fee rather than a fine is crucial for a successful investing mindset. Housel emphasizes the importance of recognizing the true costs associated with gaining financial security.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A thoughtful investor assessing financial charts, a corporate office environment, soft diffused lighting, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, #BA8B6A, contemplative mood, modern minimalist art style, digital artwork, close-up focus on facial expression --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"modern minimalist","overlay_opacity":70,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#BA8B6A"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Black.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Everything Comes with a Price Tag","section_body":"In finance, understanding that everything, including returns, has a price is fundamental.
