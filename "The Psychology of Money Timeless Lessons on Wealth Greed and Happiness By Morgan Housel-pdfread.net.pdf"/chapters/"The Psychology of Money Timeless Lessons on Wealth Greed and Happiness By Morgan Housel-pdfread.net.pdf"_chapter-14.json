{"book_name":"The Psychology of Money Timeless Lessons on Wealth Greed and Happiness By Morgan Housel-pdfread.net.pdf","genre":"finance","chapter_id":12,"chapter_title":"SURPRISE!","summary":"In this chapter, Morgan Housel explores the unpredictability of the future and the dangers of relying too heavily on historical data for investment decisions. He highlights that while history can provide lessons, it often fails to predict unprecedented events that significantly influence markets. The chapter warns against the 'historians as prophets' fallacy and emphasizes the evolving nature of economics and investment strategies. Ultimately, it argues that surprises—and the inability to foresee them—are crucial elements in understanding financial landscapes.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A wise owl symbolizing knowledge and surprise, a library filled with ancient books as the environment, warm lighting to evoke wisdom, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, #1D1D1D, contemplative mood, minimalistic art style, digital illustration, close-up with depth of field --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"wisdom and surprise","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#1D1D1D"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Medium.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Surprising Events Are Common.","section_body":"Stanford professor Scott Sagan reminds us that surprising events happen all the time.
