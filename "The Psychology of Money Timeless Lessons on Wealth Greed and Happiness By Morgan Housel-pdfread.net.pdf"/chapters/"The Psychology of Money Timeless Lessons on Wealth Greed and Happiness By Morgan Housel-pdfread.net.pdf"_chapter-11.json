{"book_name":"The Psychology of Money Timeless Lessons on Wealth Greed and Happiness By Morgan Housel-pdfread.net.pdf","genre":"finance","chapter_id":9,"chapter_title":"WEALTH IS WHAT YOU DON’T SEE","summary":"In this chapter, Morgan Housel explores the irony that true wealth is often hidden from view. Many people mistakenly equate visible symbols of success, like luxury cars, with genuine financial prosperity. Instead, real wealth is represented by the financial choices not made, the extravagant purchases not pursued, and the assets built over time. The chapter emphasizes the importance of understanding the distinction between 'rich' and 'wealthy'—the former being merely a reflection of present income, while the latter embodies options and freedom derived from savings and assets. Ultimately, wealth requires self-control and the ability to prioritize long-term benefits over short-term gratification.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A subtle contrast between luxury items and hidden savings, urban environment, soft natural lighting, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F, #E6E5D7, thoughtful, modern minimalism, digital illustration, close-up shot --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"modern minimalism","overlay_opacity":70,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#E6E5D7"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":5,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Irony of Money and Wealth","section_body":"Money and wealth often come with ironic contradictions.
