{"book_name":"The Psychology of Money Timeless Lessons on Wealth Greed and Happiness By Morgan Housel-pdfread.net.pdf","genre":"personal finance","chapter_id":2,"chapter_title":"LUCK & RISK","summary":"In this chapter, the relationship between luck and risk is explored, highlighting how both factors significantly influence outcomes in life. The examples of Bill Gates and Kent Evans illustrate how one can experience remarkable success while the other faces tragic misfortune, both due to circumstances beyond their control. The chapter emphasizes that while effort and skill are important, they are often overshadowed by the unpredictable elements of luck and risk. Ultimately, it challenges readers to reconsider how they judge success and failure, suggesting that every outcome is a blend of these two forces. Understanding this dynamic can foster a more compassionate view of oneself and others.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A split scene representing luck and risk, white backdrop, soft daylight, #8C3F3F, #4B2E2B, #D9B4A6, contemplative mood, modern minimalism, digital art, high resolution --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"Contrasting visuals of fortune and misfortune","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#8C3F3F","#4B2E2B","#D9B4A6"],"font_primary":"Panchang-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":5,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Luck and Risk Are Siblings","section_body":"Luck and risk shape our outcomes, reminding us that life is influenced by forces beyond our individual control.
