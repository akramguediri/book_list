{"book_name":"Daring Greatly by Brene Brown.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":15,"chapter_title":"THE VULNERABILITY ARMORY","summary":"In this chapter, Brene Brown explores how we armor ourselves against vulnerability through various shielding mechanisms established in childhood. These armors range from persona and masks to numbing behaviors and perfectionism. The irony is that while these shields may feel protective, they can lead to disconnection and emotional isolation. Brown reveals that embracing vulnerability can lead to joy, connection, and authenticity. Through awareness and practice, we can identify our protective behaviors and take steps toward living wholeheartedly.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A middle school cafeteria scene representing vulnerability and connection, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, golden ochre, muted forest green, soft blush pink, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"nostalgic and reflective","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#9B643D"],"font_primary":"Panchang-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Regular.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"THE SHIELDS OF VULNERABILITY","section_body":"We often put on armor to protect ourselves from the pain of vulnerability.
