Using this framework, we can assess which worries actually deserve our attention. This helps us focus on what truly matters rather than spinning into anxiety.

Some are merely 'Category 1' — likely to fizzle out without any impact. Recognizing the levels of our worries helps us manage them effectively. This realization can reduce the power that these anxieties have over our lives.","quote":"‘Mulling the likelihood of a potential shitstorm actually coming to pass is a useful exercise.’"},{"id":3,"section_title":"The Power of the 'Probometer'","section_body":"Consulting your own 'probometer' allows you to evaluate the reality of your situations. This helps ground your thoughts and assess how true your fears are. Often, we are facing fears that have very low probabilities of occurring. Logic can pull us back from the edge of panic.","quote":"‘Consulting your probometer helps you focus on the reality of your situation.’"},{"id":4,"section_title":"The Effect of False Advertising","section_body":"Just like unrealistic 'after' photos in advertisements, many of our fears are exaggerated by our minds.

Not worth worrying about.’"},{"id":8,"section_title":"Shifting Perspective","section_body":"Changing how you view potential disasters can minimize their emotional impact.
