Recognizing O.P.P. is the first step in learning to detach ourselves from external issues. It opens the door to identifying what truly matters in our own lives. Let's embrace the idea that we are not responsible for others’ feelings or situations.","quote":"Not everything is your responsibility."},{"id":2,"section_title":"Why Detach?","section_body":"Detaching from O.P.P. allows for mental clarity and emotional peace. When we stop worrying about what others think or do, we give ourselves permission to focus on our own thoughts and actions. This shift leads to improved mental health and reduced anxiety. Embracing this mindset is essential for personal growth.","quote":"Your energy is precious; don't waste it on what you can't control."},{"id":3,"section_title":"Freedom from Burden","section_body":"Letting go of O.P.P. releases us from emotional burdens that hinder our happiness.

It's time to prioritize our own life’s journey.","quote":"Release the burden, embrace your freedom."},{"id":4,"section_title":"Empower Yourself","section_body":"Empowerment comes from understanding that we can only control our own reactions and decisions.
