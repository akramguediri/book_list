She humorously compares emotions to puppies that can be endearing yet distracting. The key is to acknowledge these emotions, give them a temporary 'visitation period,' and then focus on resolving the issues at hand. Knight cautions against allowing emotions to run rampant while emphasizing the necessity of feeling emotions without letting them inhibit action. Ultimately, she encourages readers to practice emotional 'puppy crating' to regain control and calm down when needed.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A whimsical scene depicting a playful puppy representing emotions, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a cozy, inviting setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, warm beige, soft brown, deep green, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"playful and inviting","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F"],"font_primary":"CabinetGrotesk-Black.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Emotions Are Like Puppies.","section_body":"Just as puppies can be fun and entertaining, so can our emotions be comforting.
