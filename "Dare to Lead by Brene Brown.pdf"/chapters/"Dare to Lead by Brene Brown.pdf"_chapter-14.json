{"book_name":"Dare to Lead by Brene Brown.pdf","genre":"leadership","chapter_id":14,"chapter_title":"LEARNING TO RISE","summary":"In this chapter, Brené Brown emphasizes the importance of teaching resilience skills before individuals face failure. She argues that true bravery in leadership comes from knowing how to rise after a fall, which involves a three-part process: the reckoning, the rumble, and the revolution. Brown reflects on her experiences with millennials and the need for open conversations about failure and emotions. The chapter also introduces the concept of 'shitty first drafts' as a way to capture the initial stories we tell ourselves about our experiences. Ultimately, owning our narratives allows us to write new endings and cultivate a culture of courage.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A courageous leader helping their team rise after a fall, emotionally immersive and symbolically rich, in a timeless grand setting, luxurious and epic aesthetic, poetic composition — inspired by classical art, high-fashion photography, and cinematic storytelling — elegant, dramatic lighting, rich textures, soft beige, earthy taupe, muted green, ultra-detailed, 8k,","style":"Inspirational with an uplifting tone","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":10,"color_palette":["#EDE4D9","#D2BBA0","#BA8B6A"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Regular.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":5,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Teaching Resilience Is Essential","section_body":"Before we can soar high, we need to learn how to land safely.
